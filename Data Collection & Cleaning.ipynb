       "Hey Guys, planning on going with keto again. Goal is as alwas to lose weight :-). I am 190cm and 120kg. I also do 3-4hours week workout on my bike (outside or on zwift). In order to support and induce keto faster I want to start every day with a bulletproof coffee (black coffee with MCT 100% C8 oil). nothing else for breakfast, I kind of want to combine this with intermittent fasting (Lunch at ~12pm, supper at ~7pm and then nothing else). \\nWhat I also want to add are juices (produced by a slow juicer). This could be a mix of Carrot, beetroot, cucumber, lemon, apple, curcuma, ginger, orange). It's about 500ml juice and I calculated 160 calories and 22g sugar (mainly from Apple/Orange and some from Carrot). I plan to drink the juice at lunch time.\\n\\nHere's a few questions:\\n- does the black coffee + MCT C8 mix interrupt my intermittent fasting if I take it in the morning? Also is it ok to drink tea in the times that I am not supposed to eat anything? I suppose it is.\\n- MCT C8, is this the real deal? Last time I was doing the bulletproof coffee with coconut butter, also I ate bad meats (pork bacon) and my cholesterol went through the roof...\\n- Sweets and sweeteners. Do you guys have any good tips (I live in Switzerland). I realize that sweets sweetend my Maltit for example do also contain lots of carbs... so it basically has to be something with erythrit but does it also taste good? Or should I just stick to black chocolate?\\n\\nThank a lot and let me know what you think and or if I am making somewhere a mistake due to wrongful information?\\n\\nThanks!     1\n",
       "Good Morning! I have a question and figured I could get some good feedback here. So my nephew's birthday is this coming weekend and he loves ribs. So I pre-ordered some from our local smoke shop for everyone. I also ordered some dry rubbed rib tips and requested no sugar or sauce on those for my sister &amp; I. I have not found any nutritional value on these and am worried about my daily macros. I plan my meals every morning before breaking my fast with lunch. I like having power over my food and not the other way around. I don't \"cheat\" and am not ever planning to either. Am I just being overly paranoid?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",

       "My doctor recommended keto after blood tests revealed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). At only 25 years old hearing that although you barely drink, you have the liver function of an alcoholic is pretty startling and enough to push me to make the change. \\n\\nThis is my first ever post on Reddit and I could probably write a whole novel on what the experience has been. \\n\\nOne year ago my stomach and bowel flare-ups controlled my life. They dictated nearly everything I did as I was so afraid of a flare up on a road trip or at a work function etc. In the entire year since I changed my eating habits, I have had fewer than five total flare ups compared to at least two per week before. \\n\\nAfter changing my food, other healthy habits followed like increased exercise, self-care time, and far more reading to name a few. \\n\\nChanging my lifestyle has given me so much. Even though I’ve never posted, this community has been a huge part of my transformation and I guess I just want to say thank you!\\n\\nOh! And I reversed my NAFLD with my blood work back in the normal range, and lost 98 pounds in the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",

       "Welcome to the weekly /r/Nutrition feature post for personal circumstance questions and diet evaluation requests.  Wondering if you are eating too much of something, not enough of something, or if what you regularly eat has the nutritional content you want or need?  Ask here.   \\n\\n**Rules for Questions**\\n\\n* Nutrition related questions about your specific diet may be asked.  However, before asking, please remember to check [**the FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/wiki/faq#/c/purple/) first and see if it has already been covered in the subreddit.\\n\\n* You MAY NOT ask for advice as to how a nutritional choice would impact a specific medial condition. Consult a professional.\\n\\n* If you do not get an answer here, you still may not create a post about it. Not having an answer does not give you an exception to the Personal Nutrition posting rule.\\n\\n**Rules for Responders**\\n\\n* Support your claims - Where applicable ALL responses should support any claims made by including links to science based evidence / studies / data. Need to find the evidence and track down primary sources? Try looking for information at [**PubMed**](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) or [**Google Scholar**](http://www.scholar.google.com). Other sources of nutrition information can be found at the [**USDA Food Composition Database**](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list), [**NutritionData**](http://nutritiondata.self.com/), [**Nutrition Journal**](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/), and [**Nutrition.gov**](https://www.nutrition.gov/) (a service of the National Agricultural Library).\\n\\n* Keep it civil - Converse WITH the other person rather than conversing ABOUT the other person. If you disagree about the science, the source(s), or the interpretation(s) then do so civilly.  Any personal attacks will be removed and may lead to a ban. Let moderators know of these kinds of issues by using the report button below any comments containing personal attacks.\\n\\n* Keep it on topic - This subreddit is for discussion about nutrition.  Disparaging commentary about others is off topic.  Non-nutritional facets of food are even off topic.  Off topic comments will be removed.

       "This is not a fad thing. I know bone broth is just a well marketed stock. \\n\\nI am having DJS in a month and need water thin liquids for a few days. I hope I can also have pureed soups during this time, but my surgeon said to prepare just in case as I'll most likely be using a syringe for meals to begin with. Anything thicker than water will block the syringe and I want a savoury option instead of just sweet protein/meal replacement shakes. Bone broth is something often recommended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
