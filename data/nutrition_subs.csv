nutrition,What is the healthiest way to drink alcohol?,"So, alcohol is not something you want as part of your regular diet, but if someone's going to get wasted what's the best way to do it?

nutrition,calcium RDI - how would you achieve this figure without dairy or supplements?,"dairy has gotten a bad rap for its saturated fats.

as a concussion sufferer I was told to stay away from dairy. I realized that I was not close to the RDI for calcium for years though. as such I started drinking milk again.

after looking at the calcium content for foods like salmon - which I eat a few times a week - it comes no where close to that of milk. salmon seems to be one of the foods highest in calcium after dairy. this suggests to me its very hard to hit the RDI for calcium without consuming dairy.

calcium supplements are said to be bad for the heart.

calcium is also required for the synthesis of vitamin d. 

im left consuming milk. im not asking - and have not decided yet - if milk is bad (although I am curious if you were to have an opinion on that). I am asking how would one achieve calcium RDI without dairy and calcium supplements. it seems impossible."

1. Are broccoli seeds a superior source of sulforaphane?   
2. Are erucic acid levels in broccoli seeds a reason not to use seeds and instead use sprouts?   
3. Why does Dr Rhonda Patrick, or anyone for that matter not recommend seeds over sprouts?   
4. Is this just a case of consensus, popular opinion being wrong that's confusing me?

nutrition,Gut Balance Revolution Phase 1,"Greetings,

For Gerard Mullin's book, ""The Gut Balance Revolution,"" does anyone know how Phase 1 treats peanuts and peanut butter? Most common foods are listed in one of three categories: favor, few, forget (i.e. eat, eat sparingly, don't eat). Peanuts are mentioned in the charts for Phase 2, but for some reason are not listed anywhere in Phase 1 as far as I can find. Does anyone know how Phase 1 handles peanuts/peanut butter?

nutrition,Plant-Based News and PCRM - are they trustworthy?,"Ever since I got into nutrition, I have had videos from these two channels constantly pop up in my recomendations on YouTube. I've watched quite a few of them, and the things they claim are spectacular to say the least: there are tons of stories there about people reversing and getting rid of chronic disease by giving up animal products, descriptions of studies showing catastrophic detrimental effects of animal produce etc. And all of these claims seem logical, and I do not generally see anything off with their explanations (perhaps not surprisingly, since I'm in high school), but the sheer grandiosity of their ideas makes me very suspicious.

I mean, if whole-food plant-based diets really were THAT beneficial, then all of the physicians would probably be on board with their patients switching to these diets. However, when a year ago I said to my family physician that I wanted to become vegetarian, she went berserk with telling me that this is a very stupid idea and that it would wreak havoc on my health. Now, by that point I had already been on a vegetarian diet for a month or so, and it was a pretty unbalanced diet, with a lot of dairy, sugar and processed produce and very little vegetables, especially leafy greens; hence, I had a lot of nasty symptoms like constipation, anemia and hair loss. But still, instead of directing me to a dietitian or something, she straight out told me that I HAD to eat meat.

PCRM did talk about physicians who did not recommend plant-based diets, and their general ideas were that they were either ultra-conservative and stubborn, either meat and dairy industry puppets. However, even though I do not know my family physician as a person too well, she has been taking care of me and my family all my life and, in conversations, she seems like a very reasonable and intelligent woman. She does give off a few red flags, for example, she often perscribes vitamin supplements instead of telling of possible ways to get them from diet, but still, I do not really see her as an ""industry puppet"".

Now, I am not a UK or US citizen - I live in a post-Soviet country in East Europe, and medicine here generally sucks, but still, if there really had been so many studies on benefits of a vegan diet and so many cases of people with debilitating conditions being healed by it, one would expect that even here doctors would generally be on board with their patients switching to vegansim, which does not seem to be the case. I have only had one family physician over the course of my life, so I do not have too broad of a perspective, but I had also been to some gastroenterologists, and they seemed to also have been opposed to vegan and vegetarian diets.

All of this taken into context, I get a feeling that Plant-Based News and PCRM are echo-chambers of sorts, that there is quite a lot of cherry-picking going on to provide information that is pleasing to their audience. I do not have any conclusive evidence of bias from their side, but the polishedness and perfection of their ideas and the dissonance between what they say and what I have heard from health professionals in my life leads me to suggest that. Do you have any idea about the reliability of information provided by these channels? Any sources that directly criticize their content?

We've been friends since high school and he's always been a picky eater, I first found this out when we were about 18 or 19 and he said he'd grab food for himself and our friends and showed up with hamburgers with no toppings or condiments. From what I've seen most people grow out of being a picky eater and I suppose I had just assumed he had grown out of it as well. 

He just turned 30 in January and moved into the place I live in December, which gave me a deeper look into his actual diet. Every morning he eats Eggo waffles (no syrup or butter or anything just dry) and his dinner is usually one of the following: bag of potato chips, french fries, pop corn, bagel bites, or just some sort of fast food (chicken nuggets from McDonald's no sauce, hamburger plain from Jack In The Box are the main two I see.) Also all drinks are either Pepsi or Sprite. 

I'm not anywhere close to a nutritionist, but I can even tell that this is not a healthy way to live. When you're a child and are picky I understand that but I was wondering if anyone knows, like I asked above, does anyone have any information on what some longterm and short term effects would be?"

To be honest I‚Äôm really worried about what this does to his health. He mainly fruit juice and gatorade. These are obviously loaded with sugar. I want to find a way to keep him hydrated.

It honestly just recently hit me how much not drinking water must affect him mentally and physically. I know I can 100% feel when I am dehydrated and can tell it takes a toll on me.

nutrition,Calories Per Pound of Food Method,"Long Time Calorie Counter and one of the the things I personally came up with recently is the 'Calories Per Pound of Food Method' where you normalize the serving size at one pound and then calculate the quantity of calories. Basically anything under 1000 is generally fine. Here you have things like fruits and veggies, Yoghurt, meat, eggs, cooked pasta or rice etc. 1000-1600 is a bit on the indulgent side. Here you have things like fat cheeses and ice cream, basic bread or cereal etc. And then 1600-2000+ is essentially fatty food. This is where most cheeses, 'snacks', snacks (chips, chocolates), pastries, desert foods etc. will sit. It's also where you'll find (a little surprisingly) things like nuts or pumpkin seeds, which are super concentrated.

BTW: The number of calories in a pound of pure fat (the highest you can have) is just over 4000, and the number in a pound of pure carbs or protein less than half that much. Obviously foods high in carbs or protein might also have a lot of indigestible fiber."

nutrition,elimination diet replacement shakes or bars for cheap/easy?,"So I have a bunch of food allergies and I can't figure out what they are. I keep triggering myself and the thing is, sometimes (I think depending on the food) the allergic reactions don't just cause stomach aches or skin breakouts or itchiness -- I can just take nyquil for ginger tea for that. The problem is, there are some foods that cause me to snore at night which REALLY messes with my ability to concentrate the next day. Most people don't know but snoring drastically reduces sleep quality. 8 hours in bed snoring is like 2 hours of sleep to your body.

Anyway I'm homeless right now and couch surfing with a friend but it's hard to get my life together with jobs etc when once or twice a week I'm barely sleeping. I am on a tight budget and usually just eat what they have in the house. I am not allowed to use their kitchen, only micrawave, but I need to do an elimination diet. Are there are meal replacement shakes/bars that are mostly allergen free, preferably vegan (but honestly Im desperate at this point), and not horribly low calerie? I'm not trying to lose weight. I just want to go a week giving my body a rest from allergens so I can catch up on sleep debt and then slowly introduce one food at a time.

Also, I know it could technically not be food allergens, but I think it is because my sister is allergic to a ton of foods so it is most likely genetic. The only thing I know for sure is a culprit is gluten because when I cut that out things gradually got like 40% better, and I stopped snoring every night. 

Anyway sorry for the rant.

tldr. are there any high calorie meal replacement shakes or bars or meals that are not too expensive, preferably vegan, and free of common allergens?"

nutrition,Question: Does protein break down faster the more protein you consume?,"Ok, Sorry if this post is not for here, but I assumed here are the people educated enough to answer it.

Long story short I stumbled upon a video (not promoting) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo1QV\_gY\_yY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo1QV_gY_yY) where the guy claims this: ""The more protein you eat the faster your body oxidizes it and breaks it down faster."" He continues ""more protein leads to increased protein synthesis, but only for about 48-72 hours, before your body ADAPTS and it increases oxidation"". 

So he is saying to build muscle you should do something like this: Eat NO protein one day, so that your body becomes ""sensitive"". The next days you gradually increase how much your protein you eat. Then again you eat NO protein one day and so on.

Is this legit? I mean is your body more sensitive to protein after fasting. Does it absorb protein better after fasting. Does your body adapts to higher protein intake so you do not absorb it all, or at least protein synthesis decreases? Does protein break down faster the more protein you consume?

She sent me a passage from the Whole30 literature and there is some verbiage about gut inflammation and the body not being able to absorb the nutrients... as well as this now familiar talking point about gluten insensitivity. 

They can't eat dairy either, which also doesn't jive with what I've learned, as I think that as long as you don't have lactose intolerance, a small amount of low-fat dairy is important in a balanced diet.

I'm also curious about what Whole30 suggests you do after this 30 day diet? Or is it actually a cleanse? Are you supposed to keep avoiding healthy foods (lol) or gradually reintroduce them?

If I'm way off the mark please let me know, as I've said, this nutrition landscape is new to me, and I've spent most of my life making unhealthy choices. That said, it's become a passion, and I would like to understand as much as possible. 

Tl;Dr I had an idea that a Whole30 diet was a well-rounded approach to eating more whole foods, but now that I've learned more, it seems like a bunch of trendy talking points that do not set an adherent up for success. Just looking for more insight.

nutrition,Vitamin and Supplement Absorption--Timing Your Intake?,"Say you are looking at taking a supplement. It is well known that a lot of supplement excesses are literally passed out of your body via urine, but can you actually ""fool"" your body into taking in what would normally be considered an excessive amount?

For example: Vitamin X comes in a 5000 unit pill. You know the recommended daily dosage of the vitamin is, say, 1000 units. If you take a 5000 unit pill, the body processes 1000 units and you excrete the rest. But, what if you took, say, 1000 units in 8 hour intervals over the course of the day? Will you actually be able to get a better benefit from the pill?

I am thinking that when you see the ""Daily Dosage"" figure on a pill bottle or read up on the maximum dose you can take of a vitamin is really not the Daily Dosage, but an arbitrary number that most regular people would be able to safely process over a 24 hour period. Going back to Vitamin X, ""1000 Units"" is a recommended daily dosage because MOST people can only process something less than 1000 units, while the maximum would be 1000 and all the rest would be waste.

If taking the pills over a period of 24 hours is not going to help, and your body excretes all extra units, does it ever make any sense to spend more money on pills with 2x or 3x the ""recommended daily dose""?"

* Vitamin   D (actually a [secosteroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secosteroid))      will deplete magnesium stores from your body as D3 (and D2) needs        magnesium to convert  the  inactive form of vitamin D to it's  active       form. See: [Magnesium and metabolism of vitamin D. PTH, parathyroid hormone; UVB, ultraviolet B; VDBP, vitamin D binding protein.](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Magnesium-and-metabolism-of-vitamin-D-PTH-parathyroid-hormone-UVB-ultraviolet-B_fig1_256188073)
* More        info about vitamin D, magnesium and K2 (but some of the links are         out-of-date) and the protocol seems to be based on one MS  study         (meta-analysis is better IMHO): [http://www.vitamindprotocol.com/](http://www.vitamindprotocol.com/)
* Video from a cardiologist in the UK:  [Why magnesium is so good for you?](https://youtu.be/oZYXBYAHhN8)

Also,      getting the RDA of magnesium from diet can be  difficult unless you     eat  a lot of spinach, pumpkin seeds, almonds, ground flaxseed.  Stress   (activating the   [sympathetic nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system#/media/File:The_Autonomic_Nervous_System.jpg))  and  alcohol also depletes magnesium. Due   to crop rotation (in  intensive  farming) the soil also has less   magnesium. (With a higher  body weight you need more Vitamin D and probably also true for  magnesium.)

As    &lt;1% of your    total body magnesium is stored in your blood the   standard serum   blood   test is not a good indicator for a deficiency.   The magnesium  RBC  blood   test is slightly better:

&gt;In       humans, red blood cell (RBC) magnesium levels often provide a   better      reflection of body magnesium status than blood magnesium   levels.  When     the magnesium concentration in the blood is low,   magnesium is  pulled   out   from the cells to maintain blood magnesium   levels within  normal   range.   Therefore, in case of magnesium   deficiency, a blood  test of   magnesium   might show normal levels,   while an RBC magnesium  test would   provide a   more accurate   reflection of magnesium status of  the body.   For exact   estimation of   RBC magnesium level, individuals  are advised   not to   consume   vitamins, or mineral supplements for at  least one week   before     collection of RBC samples. A normal RBC  magnesium level ranges     between   4.2 and 6.8 mg/dL. However, some  experts recommend aiming    for a  minimum   level of 6.0 mg/dL on the RBC  test.

From: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6316205/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6316205/)

Some have suggested the magnesium RBC test combined with the magnesium urine test would give a better diagnosis.

And from the Vitamin D section in: [Vitamin and Mineral Interactions: The Complex Relationship of Essential Nutrients](https://www.deannaminich.com/vitamin-and-mineral-interactions-the-complex-relationship-of-essential-nutrients/):

&gt;*Magnesium*  
\- Supplementing with [vitamin D](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25835233) improves serum levels of [magnesium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19402296) especially in obese individuals.  
\- [Magnesium](http://advances.nutrition.org/content/7/1/25.full) is a cofactor for the biosynthesis, transport, and activation of vitamin D.

nutrition,Easy meal prep for 3-4 days of good lunches,"Every week when I have a day off from work, I‚Äôve been doing meal prep for my work days and it only takes me less than an hour for 3-4 meals. 

Rather than a peanut butter jelly sandwich, I basically roast some chicken (can substitute tofu) with olive oil and seasonings and while thats roasting, I saut√© a bunch of veggies in a big skillet with olive oil. It can be anything. Some of my favorites are sugar snap peas, bell pepper, sweet onion, green beans, sweet potato, and cauliflower just for some examples. 

Then once the chicken is finished roasting, I cut it up into bite sized pieces and toss it in with the rest once all the vegetables are caramelized to your likening. Optionally, you can add your own sauce like soy sauce/hot sauce or what I‚Äôve been doing is using this amazing coconut spicy curry sauce I found at the grocery store. I just simmer it all in that for a few minutes and it‚Äôs done. 

I let it cool and separate the food into 3 different containers. It‚Äôs much cheaper than getting takeout instead and better for you. You also know exactly what‚Äôs in it. I‚Äôve been doing this every week and have been noticeably saving money. It takes me around $15 to buy all the ingredients if I had to guess.

nutrition,A Protein Intake of 1g/Lb of Body Weight is too Much for Most of Us - It May not be as Inocuous as You Think,"I posted recently about 2 huge meta analyses showing the effects of dietary protein intake on lean body mass. That generated a lot of interest, but at that point I failed to mention how this compares to the circulating folk wisdom of 1g/Lb (2.2g/kg) of body weight. I wanted to expand here on my previous post to give a more complete picture.

The first meta-analysis was from Morton et al. in 2017 ([https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/6/376](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/6/376)) which showed that, in a heterogenous mixed group of trained and untrained individuals, gains in lean body mass plateau after 1.6g/kg/day (body weight). For trained individuals this number is closer to 1.8g/kg/day of body weight.

The second meta-analysis was larger - done by Tagawa et al. in 2020. ([https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/1/66/5936522](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/1/66/5936522)) It also studied a heterogenous group, showing that gains in LBM reduce but do not disappear after 1.3g/kg/day of body weight. The gains after that increase in a dose-dependant fashion. 

Both of these studies show a recommendation of less than the 2.2g/kg of body weight. Why? These studies excluded athletes who were taking anabolic steroids (AS)/performance enhancing drugs. AS dramatically increase muscle protein synthesis potential leading to a larger than average protein utilisation when compared to even the most trained natural athletes. 

The danger of this 1g/lb recommendation being circulated for all groups of individuals are real. Firstly, excessively high protein intake worsens outcomes in mild renal insufficiency - leading to early degeneration of kidney function. This is not an issue for most, since the majority of us have normal kidney function.   
However, there are a proportion of the population with undiagnosed mild renal insufficiency since it is completely asymptomatic. These individuals could be guiding themselves to premature dialysis dependancy: [https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/abs/10.7326/0003-4819-138-6-200303180-00009](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/abs/10.7326/0003-4819-138-6-200303180-00009)

High protein intake also causes increased cancer mortality in 50-65 year olds: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155041311400062X](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155041311400062X)

It also increases the risk of embryonic death &amp; subsequent miscarriage in pregnant women:  
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5882021/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5882021/)

For these reasons, the UK government's Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) is set at 0.75g/kg/day of body weight ([https://www.nutrition.org.uk/index.php?option=com\_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=259&amp;Itemid=214124&amp;limitstart=2](https://www.nutrition.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=259&amp;Itemid=214124&amp;limitstart=2)). This is a reasonable flat conservative recommendation for all adults, without understanding your subgroup.

Also keep in mind that protein composition/leucine content is critical to maximal performance: [https://nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12986-016-0124-8](https://nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12986-016-0124-8)

Based on this - the recommendations should be as follows:

Anabolic steroids in a competitive athlete (although I cannot recommend this) - 2.2g/kg/day of body weight  
Healthy resistance trained adult - 1.8g/kg/day of body weight  
Healthy non resistance adult - 1.3-1.6g/kg/day of body weight  
High protein susceptibility groups - 0.75g/kg/day of body weight 

The information is summarised here: [https://youtu.be/9MPKMfapP5M](https://youtu.be/9MPKMfapP5M)

nutrition,"""Only 5% Body Fat Stores Burned""","A Registered Dietician on Tik Tok posted this video:

[https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMea4mcHJ/](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMea4mcHJ/)

In the video, she references that the body doesn't have enough carbs for energy, and when she brings up the body burning fat, she says that ""Only 5% of fat stores can be burned, go for the muscle"" with no reference to...anything really. No context, no...nothing.

I commented on the video asking for clarification on this -- and of course I have received no response.

Does anyone know what/how/where this 5% comes from? Or what it might be referring to? Is it, by day, by week? By body fat percentage?

If someone have 60lbs of body fat, does that mean they can only burn 3lbs of body fat before they burn muscle? In what timeframe?

I tried to find her to validate her credentials since she claims to be an RD, but I haven't had any luck. So I know to take the video with a grain of salt, but I've never heard this before, from keto or non-keto people. So I'm very confused."
nutrition,Another dumb question about CICO,"Sorry about making these posts. Even though i try to search within the this channel sometimes i lack some specific information that i just cant find. My focus is on micronutrients but that are some key facts about macros that are not clear.

1. Assume one has total calories out of 2000 (for maintenance), and that person has a goal of loosing weight. Let's assume a deficit of 500 calories in order to achieve this goal. From my understanding the best way to go about it is to have this deficit coming from not eating+exercise. It doesn't really matter how much/less of each as long as you get to 500 calories. Let's assume this in order for me to reach my point: One will eat only 1800 calories and will exercise for 300 calories. As you can see a 'not eating' of 200 calories and an exercise of 300 calories for a total of 500 calories.
2. Now i also understand that if you goal would be different as in trying to build muscle one would need to be in a surplus. This surplus (+exercise) would transform intro 'new' muscle mass. Again 2000 is maintenance, you would exercise for a total of 300 calories ...so you would need to eat ....let's say 2500 calories, thus 500 extra calories (of eating) but in fact only +200 extra calories (as 300 will burn doing the exercise)
3. Now here comes my question: what happens if starting with 2000 calories maintenance, with a goal of loosing weight (i would welcome gaining mass, but my target is loosing weight) i would do this - instead of eating at an (nominal) deficit i would eat at a surplus .... let's say 2300 calories. Now i realize I'm messing up my target (500 calories deficit) so i start to exercise for 800 calories. So in the end we end up as per my 1st example: 2300 (calories in) - \[2000 (calories out - metabolic) + 800 (calories out exercise)\] = 500 calories deficit ???

Logic says i will lose weight as i truly am in a net deficit, but still i ate 2300 calories (more than needed). Maybe i should ask what would be the differences between 1 and 3? How will they affect me... i feel there should be a difference not just infer equality because  cico model si absolute and 500 calories deficit is 500 calories deficit"

nutrition,"Homemade Greek yogurt, acid whey, calories and protein","I make a lot of whole milk yogurt and strain it for Greek style. I recently made a batch that I managed to drain quite a bit of acid whey out of so I decided to check the numbers in calories vs. protein, to see how it compares to brands like Chobani, which runs about 200 Cals and 20g protein per cup. 

My yogurt started with 2 quarts at 150 Cals and 8g protein per cup, and I drained off about 6 cups of acid whey (which the internet tells me is 59 Cals and 1.9g protein per cup). That left me with 2 cups of really thick yogurt with (150x8 - 59x6)/2 = 423 Cals and (8x8 - 6x1.9)/2 = 26.3g protein per cup, all approximate. This is quite a bit higher in cals-per-g protein than store bought stuff. I realized that there's really no amount of acid whey one can drain from whole milk yogurt to end up with Chobani's claim of about 10 cals per g protein. 

I'm wondering if my numbers are off somehow, or if Chobani is doing something else to get such a low cal-per-g protein ratio. Even with slightly less protein loss to the acid whey, based on other numbers close to 1g/cup, it doesn't make a difference. Any ideas?

I'm obviously not going to stop making my own yogurt. It's too good. But I'd like to know what's going on."

nutrition,Sugar vs Calories? Which one causes fat/obesity?,"I just saw a few videos explaining how sugar is the number one cause of obesity and is a huge problem for overall health (obese or not). Now I understand that sugar is terrible for you, but I‚Äôm wondering... Isn‚Äôt obesity technically just a product of eating more calories than one burns off? 

So my question is now, if you had two people with the exact same body dimensions and everything (body fat, height everything), and you put them both on the same amount of calories per day, except one of them doesn‚Äôt consume sugar at all (or consumes the bare minimum) whilst the other one has a normal diet (which contains a decent amount of sugar)... would the person who doesn‚Äôt consume sugar lose weight or fat? 

Is there really a correlation between sugar and fat? Or is it because sugar is addictive therefore people are inclined to consume more calories? 

Really curious on what some of the answers are :)"

nutrition,Types of alcohol in foods and drinks beyond adult beverages?,"I know that there are different types of alcohol but I recently heard that foods beyond wine, beer, and hard liquor have alcohol too. In particular, over in the pregnancy subreddit groups, some of the girls are craving a beer and justify drinking O'Douls or whatever other crap that passes as ""non-alcoholic"" while pregnant. Their logic is loosely based on info that apparently orange juice and bread have alcohol too- so it *must* be safe. I don't think it's the same thing but I would like to understand the topic better, especially in regards to fetal development. Doctors tell you to drink juice, but rarely mention the non-alcoholic beer aisle as a good idea. 

So that's my question, is there alcohol in orange juice like there is in a glass of wine or vodka? or is this a gross exaggeration to justify their drinking? I remember from chemistry that there are different types of alcohol but google is not helpful and only wants to provide recipes for cocktails. I'm also aware that ABV is different for wine vs. juice and you can't get 'drunk' on juice, but it seems odd to lump them together.

nutrition,"Why is there no definitive information how much a ""serving"" of vegetables weighs?","This is starting to piss me off. Let's use spinach for example.

Ok, that seems straight forward, but then I search google and find various sources claiming that actually a serving is 30g, or a serving is 75g-80g.

Is there any definitive information out there, or is it guess work. It makes no fucking sense that ""servings"" are by volume not weight, the idiot that popularized using volume has done everybody a disservice.

Final question, lets say that one serving is in fact 42g, do you think 42g fresh spinach and 42g frozen spinach are pretty much the same, or is there a difference in terms of water weight, etc?"
nutrition,Is an at-home dry brine as carcinogenic as store-brought processed meats?,"Multiple articles have pointed out that processed meats are a group 1 carcinogen, labeling their association with cancer as causative, not just correlated.

From [this article](https://www.mdanderson.org/publications/focused-on-health/eat-less-processed-meat.h11-1590624.html) for example:

&gt;Any meat that has been preserved by smoking, curing or salting is processed.

These articles then don‚Äôt address a pretty immediate question... what's the line between something being processed and something that's just had some salt added to it? 

I assume just adding salt during cooking doesn't suddenly push things into the territory of ""processed"" meats, but what about at-home, salt-based dry brines for relatively short durations (e.g. 24 hours)? And if that is considered processed, just how bad is it? As bad as what's found in deli counters? Is it something worth being concerned about at all?"

I guess my question is...how relevant is this textbook? Has nutrition science radically changed since 2003, so much so that I'd be better off not reading it?

Also, specifically...1) What's the verdict on dairy? We got full fat for years because of other things I've read. But this strongly encourages low fat dairy. This seems to go against the latest research I've seen on women's reproduction and low-fat dairy products? Thoughts? 

And 2) Are we still onboard with the amount of grains that were advocated in 2003? I am all for my whole grain products and always have been. Just didnt know if the recommend daily amount had been lowered since then, or if pop culture nutrition has just been louder than the science lately."
nutrition,Supplement question/ Inflammation good or bad for muscle growth?,"So I have done a lot of research about Omega 3, Curcumin and Arachidonic Acid. All of these three supplements are said to be very beneficial for muscle building. Omega 3 works by increasing protein synthesis and reducing inflammation. Curcumin also works by reducing inflammation. Arachidonic Acid on the other hand works by increasing local inflammation in the muscle after a workout and as far as I know inflammation is necessary for the anabolic response of the body. So how can the anti inflammatory properties of omega 3 and Curcumin be good for muscle growth. The internet answers this question like this: ‚ÄúThe anti inflammatory properties reduce inflammation after a workout and reduce recovery time and DOMS. Because of this you can train a muscle more often with a higher intensity.‚Äù Isn‚Äôt this paradox with the information I provided above? How can you recover faster with a lower anabolic response? One of the two information has to be wrong right? Tony huge for example says that the anti inflammatory properties from omega 3 and Curcumin are bad for muscle building and he recommends to have them as low as possible if your goal is to gain as much muscle as possible. Max Madson a German bodybuilding coach also thinks that both omega 3 and Curcumin are essential for health but he also thinks that the anti inflammatory properties are bad for muscle growth so he recommends to take them as far away from you workout as possible. What do you guys think about that? Next thing I‚Äôm wondering is what happens if you take all three supps. Will they cancel each other out? Will you get all benefits if take the omega 3/Curcumin in the morning and the ARA pre workout in the afternoon?"
nutrition,What are your thoughts on a vegan diet?,"I went to a doctor who highly encouraged eating vegan, so I gave it a shot. For about a year, I ate a fairly clean plant-based vegan diet. 

But I‚Äôve long since given up that diet.

For one thing, I‚Äôve realized that I feel the best and most energized after a meal which includes a portion of meat (like chicken, fish, or turkey, or even some red meat) and a large serving of vegetables. 

Also, and more importantly, after doing some minimal reading on the matter, I‚Äôve learned that humans have been eating meat basically our whole existence. I was watching a show called ‚ÄúConnected‚Äù on Netflix, and in the first episode, they were interviewing a researcher who discovered the oldest piece of poo. When they analyzed its contents, the primary substance (?) they found in the excrement was meat, secondary were vegetables and fruit.

nutrition,Should you reduce Omega-6 fats?,"I've always read that to improve the omega-3/6 ratio it's just as, if not more, important to cut back on omega-6 fats as it is to increase omega-3 fats in your diet.  In a 'reduce as much as you can without limitations' kind of way.  

However, I've just seen this article by Harvard Medical School titled '[No need to avoid healthy omega-6 fats](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/no-need-to-avoid-healthy-omega-6-fats)' which says ""To improve the ratio of omega-3 fats to omega-6 fats, eat more omega-3s, not fewer omega-6s.""

It's backed by a lot of research and the American Heart Association. 

Although it does have a stipulation at the end of the article of 11 to 22 grams for someone that takes in 2,000 calories a day.   So maybe it's just a case of don't cut back unless you're massively over the suggested amount?   But I feel like that's the case for pretty much anything we eat, especially fat related. 

The whole article has a lot of information and research sources, but I'll paste possibly the most important bit below:

""It turns out that the body converts very little linolenic acid (omega-6) into arachidonic acid (inflammatory), even when linolenic acid is abundant in the diet. The AHA reviewers found that eating more omega-6 fats didn't rev up inflammation. Instead, eating more omega-6 fats either reduced markers of inflammation or left them unchanged.""

Wondered if anyone else had any opinions on this or had heard the same or otherwise?"

nutrition,Health implications of Cheap Olive Oil,"Hi guys,

I understand how cheap vegetable oils, or low oleic oils are bad because of how they combust and leave more free radicals behind then better oils. 

Cheap olive oil doesn‚Äôt taste the same as proper stuff, but does it have the same bad health implications as vegetable oils.

After my workouts, I drink an Optimum Nutrition‚Äôs Gold Standard Whey Protein powder shake, which based upon what I researched, is a pretty solid product. Outside of that, I‚Äôve tried Body Tech products as well. Haven‚Äôt heard anything negative about them either. 

Where my confusion comes from, is all the ‚Äúinstant‚Äù protein shakes out on the market. I could go to ten different websites and find a particular product rated as good on one website and bad on another. They all seem to be marketing websites and not fact based. 

I like to have a shake in the morning on my way to work. I‚Äôve tried Muscle Milk, Premier Protein, and Protein Plus. The only one of the three that seems to consistently get a negative review is Muscle Milk, but I‚Äôve heard positive and negative on the other two. I‚Äôve seen numerous other brands that you will also see as top rated on one site, but negative on another as well.

I've been trying to listen to unbiased  podcast about the scientific scientific literature about health and nutrition and I really don't think that it exists, it is all about ketogenic movement.  


Now saturated fat and high cholesterol is good for you, fat is a good against cancer, it is a good treatment for epilepsy  and extends longevity and health span and it is a waste of time to get you fiber in because it is useless, some carnivore people even say that fiber is bad for you also we are not meant to eat wheat and grains, vegetables are literally poisonous for humans.  


Everyone is speculating about ancestral eating, is there any concrete proof on how they actually ate and behaved? 

  
You can literally go online and find a study to support you claim, how can you separate science from pseudoscience?   
My problem is most likely that I'm listening to podcasts instead of actually reading the literature it self but with work, school and a newborn baby I have very little time to do that.  


Where can I find scientific unbiased literature online?  
Are there any podcasts about nutrition that you can recommend?  
I've been listening to this podcast Peak Human and that guy says he is on a mission to find the truth about nutrition and says that all we have been taught about nutrition is bullshit.

Sorry about the rant but there is just to much information out there and it is hard to separate the truth from bullshit why do we always have to be so extreme when it comes to diets?."

I typically steer away from putting extra salt in food (and thus also try to avoid seasoning salt, garlic salt, and taco seasoning), since I know most foods in the modern era already have a ton of salt in them unless you get every last ingredient from a farmer's market or something. But when I cook I usually use a decent amount of seasoning, especially if I'm making chicken, and I've recently become weary of seasonings which I usually use quite a bit - onion powder, garlic powder, adobo, sazon, chili powder, cajun seasoning, hickory seasoning, garam masala, harissa powder, etc. 

My question is, is it significantly healthier to eat unseasoned (but way less flavorful) food? I'm not some sort of health nut but I do want to be able to live an active, functional life for as long as possible so I try to consume as little sodium, sugar (in processed foods, I do eat fruits and vegetables which may have copious amounts of sugar), trans fats, and saturated fats as I reasonably can w/o restricting myself to some extremely rigid, bland diet."

Something to keep in mind is that they run a company (AlgaeCal) and they also sell magnesium oxide supplements.

I read the studies/reviews linked in this article but frankly, can undertand it fully.

nutrition,Can the human body produce a protein from stored fat while being on a pro-longed fast?,"I heard that prolonged fasts can have huge benefits provided you have enough stored fat to burn and keep your electrolytes in check plus vitamins/minerals but what about protein?

nutrition,Beat inflammation with intermittent fasting,"One of the greatest health risks of all time is inflammation üî•

The root of the word in Latin means ‚Äòset fire‚Äô and that‚Äôs exactly what chronic inflammation does:

It can ‚Äòburn up‚Äô your tissues and organs leaving them failing in their ability to do their job, which of course, has tremendous and negative consequences on your health.¬†

Fortunately, there‚Äôs a way to ease inflammation and allow your body to use it to its advantage, and that‚Äôs through intermittent fasting:

**Beat inflammation with(out) food**

A significant amount of research shows that periods of fasting from food may improve body mass, blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol. Now, why would that be?

Throughout early history our routines were largely dictated by a day night cycle. Without a constant supply of electricity, our ancestors were forced to be active during daylight hours, but rest at night. Food intake was also dictated by its availability.

Most people would eat during restricted feeding windows, and only what was available to them, allowing their bodies to fast naturally.¬†

Today, that‚Äôs not the case. Not only do we tend to graze all day, but when we burn the candle at both ends, staying awake far longer than we should, oftentimes we use that time to consume more food. We have to ask the questions then: if we hardly ever take a break from eating and we don‚Äôt rest when we‚Äôre supposed to, our bodies don‚Äôt have time to perform those critical duties that only happen during times of fasting.

The effects? Lower defense mechanisms with increased susceptibility to infections, heightened metabolic stress with insulin resistance and high blood sugar, and an increased number of damaged cells and reduced tissue repair, which are hallmarks of the signs of ageing and disease.

In other words, *not* fasting means lots of redness, pain and swelling in the body‚Äôs tissues and organs; inflammation that leads to a higher risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia and cancer.¬†

I hope this piece of content was valuable!

nutrition,Effervescent vitamin tablets -- is there a low sodium version made or are they all high in sodium?,"Some years ago I was overseas and wasn't feeling well. An acquaintance had suggested taking a vitamin tablet. I was given an effervescent tablet, much like an Alka-Seltzer antacid tablet. It was very tasty and I found myself feeling better.

So I had it in my mind that taking vitamin supplements via effervescent tablets may be a useful way to boost health. More readily absorbed in the bloodstream, versus a solid tablet that dissolves over time in the stomach?

One thing that had me curious was that the supplier I was using for my effervescent vitamin tablets was leaving off the sodium, sugar, and carbohydrate info. Only the vitamins were listed. I had sent an inquiry to the company (in Germany), but never heard back. So I went to a competitor product where I managed to find that information. 20g of sugar, 11.5g of sodium. PER TABLET. This shocked me.

Well, it turns out that Alka-Seltzer, the ubiquitous antacid remedy has 475mg of sodium per tablet. You take 2 tablets per dose. And if you do that 4 times per day (as recommended), you're ingesting nearly 4g of sodium. The US FDA recommendation is 2.3g of sodium per day. So basically, taking one 11.5g sodium vitamin tablet daily is a bad idea.

I'm wondering if this is the nature of such a product, or if there's a low sodium version? I've been unable to find an answer thus far."

There are different types of sweeteners available in the market like stevia, palm sugar, date sugar, aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, etc. Having sugar free and sugar free food can definitely help in reducing weight and blood sugar levels. Whereas on the other hand use of sugar free over the time and if not used as per the guidelines can lead to several problems like weight gain, high blood sugar levels, digestive issues and other metabolic disorders"

I recently read in a blog post that the reason k2 in chicken thighs is so high is because factory farmed chickens are fed vitamin k3 (synthetic vitamin k) which they convert to k2 in their bodies. This blew my mind.

It wasn't always this bad over the years, but I've noticed these ""healthy"" food companies are going a little excessive about it and giving in to have an edge with competitors."

nutrition,Carbohydrates do not inherently cause insulin resistance - only in a caloric excess,"A common misconception I see on this subreddit is that a high-carbohydrate diet would cause insulin resistance, due to elevated insulin levels to process the glucose.

This is a false claim - there's no evidence for insulin resistance caused directly by insulin spikes from dietary carbohydrates.

The main mechanism by which dietary carbohydrates cause insulin resistance, is when theyare consumed in a caloric excess - in this state, the excess glucose not used for energy/glycogen synthesis is converted into saturated fat, which is then stored in muscle tissue - this saturated fat directly causes insulin resistance.

Saturated fat from the diet accumulates in muscle tissue (*intramyocellular lipid*), and causes insulin resistance by itself. This is why high-fat diets cause insulin resistance, even without a caloric excess, and in [healthy subjects](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26615402/). The insulin resistance caused by Keto/Atkins/Paleo-style diets is masked by low fasting glucose - the insulin resistance manifests upon a glucose tolerance test.

There's no evidence to suggest that a high-carbohydrate diet, eaten within the daily recommended calorie intake, results in insulin resistance - not mechanistically, and not epidemiologically. Populations whose traditional diets feature mostly unrefined carbohydrates, and very little saturated fat, have very low rates of insulin resistance. A high-carb diet [improves glucose tolerance](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12126765/) due to its low fat content."

Looking to get back into diet and exercising. Part of the challenge of maintaining a healthy diet is that I work and live on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico six months a year; on a two week on/two week off rotation. I fly all over during the two weeks addressing whatever issues they may have. Some rigs are large and can have up to several hundred personnel. Some are tiny and can have only two men staying there. The smaller ones tend to have very limited options as far as food goes. There‚Äôs no dedicated galley staff. So the guys that are working 12+ hr shifts are also cooking or throwing together quick meals depending on the work load that day. Needless to say, quite often I find myself microwaving corn dogs or hot pockets just to put something in my stomach and then get back to work. I can find myself stuck on these rigs for many days at a time when weather isn‚Äôt optimal (which happens a lot).

The bigger rigs with larger personnel tend to have a full galley staff with much better options, a lunch counter, and sometimes even a salad bar.

nutrition,The effects of eating plain 20g sugar vs 40g sugar and 20g fiber,"So, this might be a really odd question..but I am a grad student in food science with some limited knowledge in nutrition.

I don't expect yall to know everything about keto diet much less give me a justifiable reason for the diet..but I am just curious. Only things that I know about fiber is that soluble fiber is fermented to SCFA while insoluble fibers simply absorb water and increase volume of stool, and both slows down the rise in blood glucose. So here is the question: are there any mathematical equations that predicts the changes in blood glucose based onthe content of fiber and sugar you consume? For example, if two people consume same ""net"" 20 g sugar but one person eats just 20g sugar while the other person eats 40 g of sugar with 20g of fiber supplement, will there be significant difference?"

nutrition,bcaa's made me.. high?,"I went to the local supplement shop on the weekend to pick up some whey and liquid fish oil and the dude there handed me a shaker cup of ""bcaa's.""

At this point I noticed I was in a suuuper good elevated mood, I was singing while we were getting groceries, making jokes and overall being a bit of a goofball. I told her I think whatever that dude gave me has made me loopy. 

We got back home and I ended up pulling out thr guitar and playing it with her son for a while, teaching him stuff and playing over songs.. and honestly I'm really shy about it and Ive honestly not played guitar in front of anyone for almost a decade.

Anyway Im almost convinced the dude had to have hit me with preworkout but the time to onset doesn't quite seem right, and I dont think the store guy would lie, though then again who knows what they'd do to try to sell some stuff.

Anyways, experienced runners have often recommended me preworkout snacks and workout drinks that have a decent amount of sugar since glucose can be tapped into faster than your fat reserves for energy. That idea makes me think that sugar is sort of like dense energy (functionally) which is why consuming too much and not exercising results in fat development. Is this a good way to think of sugar at all?

A while ago (I can‚Äôt remember where) I heard the argument that sugar is what truly causes fat development (as well as all the cardiovascular diseases) as opposed to fat. But if I think about what happens to a donut or candy bar when I digest it I can clearly see how saturated fats cause problems in the blood stream, but what precisely does the sugar do?

nutrition,I can no longer swallow fish oil pills. Any advice?," I use to have NO issues with swallowing pills of any size. I could even throw back 5 pills at a time and take it with water; no issues.

It's really scary because sometimes I'm unable to cough it up right away. I've tried tilting my head forward, backwards and now I'm just too scared to even attempt it again. I've tried it about 5 different times and each time it would get stuck and I just cough it up. I even tried freezing it and cutting it in half, but even that got caught and was kinda worse because I was still able to get air through, but it felt hard to cough up too for some reason.

I think it's the texture of the capsules. It feels very much like I'm just trying to swallow a piece of plastic and I think my body just reacts that way.

2. Unfortunately yes tracking your calories is a must because we don‚Äôt actually realize what we eat and how much of it . However you can make it a very short term thing. Research and compile your favorite foods and memorize the calories in them. As far a Macros that‚Äôs all dependent on you actual goal. You can lose 1-2 pounds a week eating anything and sticking to a deficient. However, let‚Äôs say you want abs, then you will have to cut carbs. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre a diabetic, you have to cut sugars. Let‚Äôs say you want to perform well at the gym, eat a lot of protein.

3. Finally. As far as workout routines goes. You don‚Äôt always need a fancy regime or a gym membership. Take a hike. Go play some TopGolf if you have it. Play table tennis or any sports. Instead of parking close at a grocery store park further back. 

It‚Äôs the slow changes that will slowly change your body for good. And remember if you don‚Äôt enjoy your workout do something you enjoy.

It's like going to a barbeque and then requesting a salad because it's the healthiest option there. Well, why even bother to go the barbeque in the first place? At that point, just make a salad at home lol! I understand maybe if you're super tight on time and need a bite to eat, but I'm talking in general when you just want to crave something. Health is wealth, but remember to enjoy it while it lasts.

I understand that fast food, yes, having it too much will do some damage. But as long as you're aware of your own health standing and what you're putting into your body, people should just eat fast food the way it is. In the past I found myself trying to find the healthiest options at these fast foods, but looking back it just didn't make sense.

nutrition,Best time to eat Yogurt," 

**What is Yogurt?**

Yogurt is a common food product produced by milk bacterial fermentation.

Yogurt bacteria are known as ‚Äúcrops of yogurt,‚Äù which ferment lactose, the normal milk sugar.

This procedure produces lactic acid, which curls milk proteins and gives the yogurt its distinctive texture and taste.

**How is it made?**

Many kinds of milk can be made with [Yogurt](https://rahnumaa.com/best-time-to-eat-yogurt-benefits-of-yogurt/). Flavors made with plain yogurt are known as fat-free because all milk varieties are called full-fat.

A creamy, thick liquid with a tangy taste is plain yogurt with no additional colorants.

Fortunately, most brands have extra additives, such as sugar and chemical colors. This yogurt is not safe.

On the other side, basic, non-sweetened yogurt has many benefits for health.

There are 7 scientific health advantages of natural yogurt without further ado.

## Bank Of Vitamins And Nutrients

In reality, Yogurt has long been known, and for a good cause, as a nutritious snack. An hour of yogurt is filled seriously with good vitamins and nutrients. Vitamin A, vitamin D, and minerals, including thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, B12, Folate, and choline, are found in each spoonful.

Yogurt is also a source of calcium, phosphate, zinc, magnesium, and potassium for your body, and enjoy that. Nutrition bags with yogurt are also included. The same 8 units of low-fat yogurt contain roughly 9 grams of protein. You will get about double the amount of protein if you prefer Greek yogurt.

### MAGICAL FACTS ABOUT YOGURT

Naturally, commercial yogurts are safe and stable brands; some are more harmful than you expect. The greatest threat is that we do not know what these yogurts are meant for. Thanks to regulatory limitations, some businesses use unreliable fructose and glucose syrup and undisclosed and preservatives. True yogurt should be made without preservatives, and its natural fermentation should keep its distinctive characteristics.

IgE (Immunoglobulin E) triggers allergic reactions that reveal themselves in the eyes. Atopic disorders such as dermatitis, asthma, and food allergy can be avoided by yogurt. When the intestinal flora is healthy, yogurt minimizes allergies. The best time to eat yogurt for the health of women, yogurt is also significant. Lactobacillus in the yogurt prevents candida (a fungal form) and vaginitis from being formed in the vagina. Studies suggest that people who eat yogurt daily have improved vaginal safety.

 

## [Best Time To Eat Yogurt?](https://rahnumaa.com/best-time-to-eat-yogurt-benefits-of-yogurt/)

 

**Before Meal**

The acidity level in the stomach is very high when you are hungry. Yogurt contains many lactic acids that destroy the acid in the stomach and sharply decrease health-care effects. Add that the protein in yogurt fills you immediately, killing the diet completely.

Cold yogurt is not a wise choice for sensitive stomachs. But warming yogurt will lose the most valuable nutrient of lactic acid. A hot yogurt may also taste very odd or sour.

You should warm the yogurt against low fire if you have no other alternative, which could lower the chance of nutrient loss.

nutrition,Help! WTF is this Weird Turmeric Powder with Oils!? (and sugar???),"I really need help with this, is it just a scam and/or is it nerutoxic?

I have 2 different turmeric powders, one ""normal"" (from Superfruit) and one that claims to keep the ""essential oils"" during extraction (from Rawpowder).     
*Both are Swedish brands.*  

The powders look very similar and I don't notice any difference when mixing each one in water (no oil streaks etc but I did this a long time ago so I could try again).

&amp;nbsp;

Rawpowder (the one with oils) also claims to have a higher ratio of curcumin compared to other brands, and when comparing the nutritional facts on the back it claims to contain 9,9 grams of fat (the oils) but also 3,2 grams of sugar??? (compared to normal turmeric with 1,7 grams of fat and 0 grams sugar (per 100 grams)).     

Rawpowders nutrition facts also adds up to a total of 104 grams?? Wtf?        
Maybe it still makes sense as a fiber or protein can also be a fat or carb?   
Idk, just pointing it out...      
Keep in mind that there needs to be room for all the minerals and other contents of turmeric, so Superfruits which adds up to 86,4 grams makes way more sense.

Superfruits also supposedly contains 3 grams more fibers ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

&amp;nbsp;

I am unable to find ANY other brand that offers a turmeric powder with oils in it...    
Note that they claim the oils have not been added, but kept by using a different extraction method than usual (can't find any info on how).      
Rawpowder is also cheaper than most alternatives, even tho it supposedly is better/healthier.

(Turmeric oils are supposed to offer health benefits as well that turmeric powders miss out on, I have no clue if this has been scientifically researched but that's their reason for including it).

Since it's Swedish, and a pretty old company, I have a hard time imagining some scam/blatant lies being made (due to EU having stricter consumer laws), but the health industry is very shady and full of scams so who knows...

I'm concerned because a lot of products like these that comes from poor countries and offer miraculous health benefits, can contain heavy metals and neurotoxic substances.    
Could the one with oils in it be dangerous to consume?      
If it's not a scam, does it really offer any extra health benefits?

Rawpowder doesn't explain well at all how the process is made and there is very little to no info at all.      
Their website is also poorly designed.

I am considering emailing them if no one here solves this.

nutrition,Very inconsistent black bean nutrition labels?,"I recently got a bag of black beans from a brand I wasn't familiar with (Carral) because it had seemingly impossible protein density compared to black beans I've had before. According to a quick google search, 97g of dry black beans contains 331 calories and 21g of protein, which sounds about right for beans. But this Carral brand has 203 calories and 22.8g of protein per 100g - that's meat macros. These are imported, with a translated nutrition label slapped on as a sticker, but the numbers are the same on the package's original spanish label. 

Is this due to a difference in labelling standards in mexico? Maybe they are counting a type of protein that is considered non-nutritive by the FDA? Or are there different cultivars of black beans with drastically different nutrition? Or is the imported label simply inaccurate due to something like a difference in accuracy regulation?

Someone help me understand here."

Does it mean, that it's dangerous to consume this amount on a daily basis, and one consuming it gonna suffer after a week or month of consuming that much?

So, like the title says: I cannot eat cruciferous vegetables, what was my dream as a kid is now a big issue. My entire life I've had a great digestive system but for about 2 years now I've had bowel issues. I've run a lot of tests with my gastro and I have no inflammation, no Crohns or anything.    


I used to make a smoothie every day with kale and some fruits to get a nice big chunk of my vitamins and minerals in, however it seems I have developed an intolerance for cruciferous vegetables, I cannot eat kale (raw/cooked), broccoli or spinach without getting gassy for 3-4 days straight and my bowel motility speeding up to the point that I sometimes dislike leaving the house. Now there's a simple but not so simple solution to this problem, quit eating cruciferous vegetables. This has worked great for me for a week by bowels are fine, no gas, no diarrhea. However I'll be missing out on nutrition, how do I fix this?"

nutrition,Why is fish recommended for lowering cholesterol/triglycerides if it has cholesterol?,"So I am not sure of the mechanism behind this and I know I am ignorant towards this issue because nutritionists and other docs recommend eating fish (I see salmon and sardines recommended a lot) but when I look at the label, the cholesterol is quite high. Some sardines are in the 90s and salmon over 100.

But when it comes to changing diet to lower cholesterol and triglycerides, fish and specifically fish oil supplements are recomended.

Now i know the suppliments don't have cholesterol and must work through omega fatty acids and that may have something to do with it? Or is this incorrect?

If supplements contain all the ""good fats"" that reduce cholesterol and triglycerides then why are fish even recommended in a diet anyway if they have cholesterol. It seems counter intuitive to my ignorant mind.

So I'm obviously missing something. I'm wondering if anyone here can help me understand it. Also what are the best foods (fish or other kinds) that work in a similar way or different way or better in reducing cholesterol/triglycerides?

I‚Äôve also been thinking that this might be a mental issue for some, I‚Äôve never have had a close relationship with food but I‚Äôve heard many people have said that a certain food is comforting to them. So maybe when they switch it can make them uncomfortable. And that causes issues mentally even if you don‚Äôt realize it and then that could cause physical problems."

I wanted to start taking supplements because despite a good sleep schedule and healthy life style I still feel very tired sometimes. 
The first one I started was collagen tablets. I took them for about 3 weeks and my hair started falling out and I got more acne ( my acne is always very irregular so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs directly attributed). So I stopped those. It‚Äôs been about a week and I think my skin is doing better. I am kind of scared to start taking any more because I saw great reviews for the collagen and had such a bad experience.
What I have started taking is 
*omega-3 (500mg a day) brand: spring valley 
*olly undeniable beauty gummies (biotin, keratin, vitamin c&amp;d) 2 gummies daily 
*country farms apple cider vinegar &amp;ginger,cayenne,maple(1 pill before breakfast)(500mg) 
*bio Schwartz greens superfood (after workouts, 3-5x a week)

This is my first week starting all of these so I have not seen any differences yet. Is it too much in general ? Is it too much at once? Are they good brands ? Any advice is appreciated.

He replied saying what's the difference between the Tysons Chicken nuggets/stripes from Costco I sometimes eat vs fast food because they're both deep-fried at some point and the caloric/nutritional differences are basically moot. Idk if I'm just incredibly naive or dumb but I never really made this connection before. Is this true? Are frozen chicken nuggets really not that good for you?

Are there any multivitamins that actually act as a 'supplement' so say maybe 25% across  the board, or 50% across the board for everything? Who wants expensive neon pee just to make them 'feel' healthy...seems like gatorade pee would be a turn off for most people....Or should it just be cutting a regular daily multi in half or into quarters?

nutrition,"Diet, Exercise, Lifestyle, and Mental Distress among Young and Mature Men and Women: A Repeated Cross-Sectional Study","Abstract

Customization of mental health therapies needs to consider the differences in degree of brain maturity between young (18‚Äì29 years) and mature (30 years or older) adults as well as brain morphology among men and women. The aim of this study was to identify the significant dietary and lifestyle contributors to mental distress in these sub-populations. Independent repeated cross-sectional sampling was performed for over a 5-year period (2014‚Äì2019) to collect data from different populations at different time-points and seasons. A backward stepwise regression analysis was used on 2628 records. Mental distress in young women was associated with high consumption of caffeine and fast-food, and it was negatively correlated with moderate-high levels of exercise as well as frequent breakfast consumption. Mature women shared several common factors with young women; however, high fruit consumption was negatively associated with mental distress. For young men, high exercise, moderate consumption of dairy, and moderate-high intake of meat were negatively associated with mental distress. In addition, high fast-food and caffeine consumption were positively associated with mental distress in young men. For mature men, strong negative associations between higher education, moderate intake of nuts and mental distress surfaced. Our results support the need to customize dietary and lifestyle recommendations to improve mental wellbeing.

nutrition,Why Can Soldiers still fight hard while starving for days to weeks (even months) while athletes would have failures in performance even with just a slight change in diet in their own sports? That even just taking out a cup of milk would cause immediate change in performance at an event?,"Years ago I remember reading about a comment from a Roman soldier who despised athletes and had a strong dislike for Roman sports (even gladiator fighting). He stated athletes live under such luxurious comfortable conditions with very fine foods and the lots of rest time. While being a soldier meant having minimal rest and some generic yucky food like raw cereal grain and bland porridge. It is this reason why he prefers being a grunt in the frontline because he prides himself as being so tough from having experienced hell in the wars he fought in. He cannot understand the appeal behind sports and why Roman citizens revere athletes like GODS. This does bring a question.

Throughout military history, there are multiple stories of soldiers fighting for days nonstop without proper food, water, and even sleep. They are already exhausted from prior skirmishes and marching so theoretically they shouldn't have the energy to continue holding a fortress or charge on with an aggressive attacks. Yet against impossible odds they succeed in such missions.

Dien Bien Phu is one such example in which during the final months of the battle, the French ran out of proper diets, adequate water, and have not had days of sleep. The fortress should have fallen about a month earlier but even under such conditions the French soldiers were able to last a month longer than should be possible.

In the battles of Antioch, the Crusaders were already starving to death by the time they took the fortress from the Turks and had a few skirmishes with outside Turkish forces that came as an answer a message requesting for aid sent by the now dead ruler of the city prior to its capture. Yet in the battle that occurred just a few days later, the heavily outnumbered European knights were able to fight off a much larger well-fed Turkish army that haven't even exerted real energy in battle.

In the Civil War, the primary reason for Confederate soldier to aggressively attack larger Union forces was to find food because they were starving and its more impressive due they actually succeeded in such engagements!

But in the athletic world, attempting to compete without proper nutrition for even a few days is suicidal. Even the sturdiest athletes with the strongest willpower like James Braddock would be massacred if they don't have a proper specialized diet. Not even modern soldier rations (which are healthy when compared to all the junk food out there) can be sufficient for an athlete for one full day of regular training. Athletes need very specialized diet that would be too expensive (or too precise to create) for the general public to indulge in.

Even taking out minor details of the diet like a single serving of meat or all the vegetables would prove devastating to athletic performance. But as I mentioned soldiers are able to perform well without proper diet and I listed many examples in which soldiers are already starving themselves to death are able to fight fiercely for a last stand and even gain miraculous victories!

The basic human body's mechanism are the same for athletes and soldiers so why don't soldiers get exhausted from a typical engagement if they don't eat breakfast while athletes do?"
nutrition,Low histamine fermentation techniques and strains,"Hey! Could anyone share their knowledge on how to ferment foods in a low-histamine manner?

Are there certain lids, which help?

Also fermenting with vinegar would not be an option I guess.

What about lactofermentation? Bad idea?

I‚Äôd be open to ferment anything: sauerkraut (juice), blueberries, fish, quail eggs, egg yolks (is that even possible?), organ meats...

But I‚Äôm a very sensitive to grains, seeds, nuts, nightshades and dairy (yes, A1 and A2 dairy unfortunately, even if goats cheese is awesome), which is why I‚Äôd avoid doing anything with them.

Coconut works a bit, and I‚Äôd be interested in how to ferment that when you do not have any fresh coconuts but only the canned milk.

Also- can you ferment things which previously have been frozen? Such as frozen tuna? I thought about fermenting some by adding store bought lacto-fermented cabbage juice.

Which strains can you recommend for histamine intolerance? I know, it‚Äôs possible to ferment foods just by themselves, but wouldn‚Äôt it be beneficial to add some beneficial strains?

nutrition,Is there Strong Scientific Proof for Nutrigenomics or other personalized/DNA-analysis/individualized research or advice?,"I want to ask about a 'dangerous' subject: whether there is, as of now, any strong scientific evidence for the quality or validity of personalized healthcare-based approaches, such as Nutrigenomics, DNA-Analysis or other types of personal analysis.

It is fairly evident that each person is different and might benefit from approaches (such as nutritional advice) that differ from the default and the dreamed goal is being able to provide personalized healthcare, nutrition advice, and so on through DNA-analysis and other types of diagnosis or analysis.
One of the reasons I'm so interested in this is because my mother suffered a severe allergic reaction to a medicine she took for a chronic disease. This is extremely rare (1&lt;10.000) but shows that generic approaches might sometimes be suboptimal. 

Anyway, I am fairly certain that up to a couple of years ago most organizations or people being able to do so are mostly fraudulent or placebo-effect based.

My question now is if there has been, as of yet, any proven positive results from DNA, genes or other types of individual analysis and recommendations with measurable positive effects beyond. If so, can you point me towards sources, preferably offering services in the EU, that have some measure or proof?

One of the examples of what I'm talking about is, for instance https://mydnahealth.co.uk/ or https://emma.health/ (Dutch) which offer DNA test kits and analysis with personalized advice. I am unsure if they are pseudoscience or not and was wondering about input from others."

Everyone has an opinion, but there's no clear consensus on what ingredients are needs vs wants. Considering the costs add up, it's important to not get lost in fad superfoods with little scientific evidence.

* Base: Banana and Spinach
* Fruit: Frozen berries, mango, etc. (rotating lineup)
* Veges: Cauliflower (rice), Zucchini, Acerola, etc. (rotating lineup)
* Fats: Avocado or Peanut butter
* Seeds: Flax seeds, chia seeds
* Liquid: Oatmilk, Cashew Milk, (basically non-dairy milk)
* Supplements (probably the least consensus): Collagen Peptides, Green Superfood Powder, Plant-based protein, Pre/Probiotics, Amino Acids, Omega-3s, Mushroom Adaptogens Powder, Supergreens Powder

nutrition,Lectins and legumes," So like a lot of other people, I've been really annoyed over the past few years by people who tout Dr. Gundry's ""The Plant Paradox"" as some kind of holy grail. I know that cooking and soaking basically destroys all lectins, and the few that remain are destroyed in the body.

However, something that's frustrated me is that I can't find any sources that have hard numbers for this. Pretty much every nutrition site says that boiling and soaking denatures lectins, but how big is this effect? Is soaking necessary, or is boiling for 20 minutes enough? What dosage of lectins causes harm? (I know just a few uncooked kidney beans is enough, but I can't find how many lectins are in one kidney bean on average.) How does the type of legume affect this? Do lentils require less cooking/soaking than beans because of their smaller surface area? Exactly how much lectin is destroyed by the body's natural mechanisms? Etc.

It would really help me if anyone had any sources with hard numbers on this (rather specific) topic."

I'm just curious as to whether there is any major difference between spreading out my water drinking or consuming large volumes(up to a liter) in a shorter period of time, aside from your stomach feeling full for a few minutes. I think the pituitary gland determines the amount of water the kidneys excrete with some hormones acting as antidiuretics, which is determined on water intake and the body's hydration(Please correct me if I'm wrong.) So, will an individual be less hydrated overall if they're consuming large volumes infrequently vs small volumes frequently due to the body and its water balancing act, or is it all the same?

nutrition,Raw turmeric vs Powder vs Curcumin,"Hello All -  I've been trying to find literature or articles on the benefit of eating raw tumeric vs a powder form.  My assumption is that the various co-factors in the root itself are more bioactive than the powdered form but maybe the difference is not significant.  The root seems to hold a lot of water; therefore, the powder is likely much more concentrated.  I have no idea how much raw to ingest to get an equivalent amount provided in a teaspoon of powder.  Does anyone have thoughts or a source to answer these questions?

One a related topic, I was looking whether to supplement with turmeric vs curcumin.  I came across this write up on the ATP Science Project which is run by naturopaths.  This article is response to a 2017 scientific study says there is absolutely zero science showing any benefit from curcumin.  The naturopaths response is that curcumins should be ingested by using turmeric which the body will properly process in the gut and liver which is a requirement to make it bioavailable/efficacious.   They also advise against using pepper to make turmeric/curcumin bioavailable.

nutrition,Nutritional information and chicken bones,"The best way to measure nutrition for chicken with bones is to cook it, weigh it, eat it, and then weigh it again? 

I'm a little confused though. Most nutritional information I have found for a raw pound of chicken wings is anywhere from 1k and up. 

There is a Texas A&amp;M study that says, on average, you receive .38 in cooked edible portions (skin and meat) vs the raw weight. 

Then the USDA says there is 240 calories in 3oz of cooked edible portions of a chicken wing.

So theoretically, 1 pound of raw chicken wings would equate to 6.08oz edible yield (.38), with the USDA info would result in 486.4 calories. 

All numbers are assuming roasted wings without oil.

Edited to add: I understand the term was coined by someone who is selling something. However the concept behind it makes a lot of sense to me, that you would prioritize certain nutrients at certain parts of your cycle. Not from supplements but from actual foods"

nutrition,Association of Major Dietary Protein Sources With All‚ÄêCause and Cause‚ÄêSpecific Mortality: Prospective Cohort Study,"[Link to Study](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.015553)https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.015553

**Abstract**

**Background**
Dietary recommendations regarding protein intake have been focused on the amount of protein. However, such recommendations without considering specific protein sources may be simplistic and insufficient.

**Methods and Results**
We included 102 521 postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women‚Äôs Health Initiative between 1993 and 1998, and followed them through February 2017. During 1 876 205 person‚Äêyears of follow‚Äêup, 25 976 deaths occurred. Comparing the highest with the lowest quintile, plant protein intake was inversely associated with all‚Äêcause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91 [0.86, 0.96]), cardiovascular disease mortality (HR, 0.88 [0.79, 0.97]), and dementia mortality (HR, 0.79 [0.67, 0.94]). Among major protein sources, comparing the highest with the lowest quintile of consumption, processed red meat (HR, 1.06 [1.01, 1.10]) or eggs (HR, 1.14 [1.10, 1.19]) was associated with higher risk of all‚Äêcause mortality. Unprocessed red meat (HR, 1.12 [1.02, 1.23]), eggs (HR, 1.24 [1.14, 1.34]), or dairy products (HR, 1.11 [1.02, 1.22]) was associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease mortality. Egg consumption was associated with higher risk of cancer mortality (HR, 1.10 [1.02, 1.19]). Processed red meat consumption was associated with higher risk of dementia mortality (HR, 1.20 [1.05, 1.32]), while consumption of poultry (HR, 0.85 [0.75, 0.97]) or eggs (HR, 0.86 [0.75, 0.98]) was associated with lower risk of dementia mortality. In substitution analysis, substituting of animal protein with plant protein was associated with a lower risk of all‚Äêcause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, and dementia mortality, and substitution of total red meat, eggs, or dairy products with nuts was associated with a lower risk of all‚Äêcause mortality.

**Conclusions**
Different dietary protein sources have varying associations with all‚Äêcause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, and dementia mortality. Our findings support the need for consideration of protein sources in future dietary guidelines."

nutrition,Suspicious about multivitamin consensus,"Seems to be: ""Most people is wasting their money"" 

Yet, it is usually a pretty cheap thing (around 10-20 bucks per month). 

While the cost for health is extremely expensive and you can pay 80-100 bucks for a single consult. The cost of having an undetected deficiency that then develop a disease, that you could probably decrease it's probability by spending 10-20 stupid bucks, is highly expensive too. 

It get worse. Almost no traditional doctor test for vitamins - minerals deficiency as a routinary thing, they just wait until you develop illness, with one of the causes probably being deficiency for years in something.  

And even after you get sick, doctor could neither be interested in testing deficiencies, but treating you with some drug instead. 

No words to the fact that for you to test for deficiencies, you need a medical order in lots of country, with the cost it means, and later you have to convince one, with or without symptoms, wich could be not very willing for it. 

So the medical system seems to push to the, get sick, then come to us for a drug, never prevention, and you are wasting your 10 bucks on a multivitamin! 

On the other hand, you have a lot of critics on the western diet. How it is that our diet is so healthy that almost nobody needs a multi and then it is so shitty that it causes a lot of nutritional deficiencies and chronic illness? 

I may be wrong, but all this doesn't close very good to me.

As I've just speed-read [this article](https://optimisingnutrition.com/the-optimal-nutrient-intake-oni/), it seems like that we should be intaking like 6 times the current RDAs to achieve ""optimal health"" (other than the satiety factor which I didn't care much about) ... not sure where do I stand on this but it seems a bit absurd and quite rough to achieve, unless we use multiple supplements, what's your take on this?"

nutrition,Why do USDA and NCCDB nutritional information differ? Even when adjusted to the same calories. Example in post,"For example - 

- 100 grams of **Chicken breast, skin eaten** (NCCDB) -  184 calories, 27.4 grams of protein, and 7.4 grams of fat.

- 100 grams of **Chicken, broilers or fryers, breast, meat and skin, raw** (USDA) is 172 calories, 20.9 grams of protein, and 9.3g of fat.

My conclusion here is that the NCCDB entry is for cooked chicken, not raw, and so the calories differ for that reason (water weight changes). 

So let's adjust the calories to be equal, and then compare macros. 

I haven't even looked at micronutrients, but if macros can be so different, I assume micros can, too.

So we still have, for example -

- 100 grams of **Chicken breast, skin eaten** (NCCDB) -  184 calories, 27.4 grams of protein, and 7.4 grams of fat.

And then also

- 107 grams of **Chicken, broilers or fryers, breast, meat and skin, raw** (USDA) is 184 calories, 22.3 grams of protein, and 9.9g of fat.

*81%* of the protein in the NCCDB entry! That's a huge difference! What is going on here, and what information can I trust?"

https://www.google.com/amp/s/thecounter.org/organic-celery-powder-nosb-vote/amp/

I‚Äôm hoping some of you already have opinions on this or have done research, and I‚Äôm also hoping others haven‚Äôt and can weigh in on what they make of all this. First, it‚Äôs well documented now that processed meats are known to cause cancer. They‚Äôre carcinogenic. I believe the numbers is a 30 percent increase in likelihood of developing certain cancers. To my knowledge, scientist don‚Äôt know exactly what role nitrates play in this or what specifically prompts them to turn into nitrites (carcinogenic) or of their are any other factors in meat that also could play a role in cancer development. (Forgive me if anything I just reiterated was worded poorly) I recently have began studying cured vs uncured meats, or rather meats that say ‚Äúno nitrates added‚Äù because they use celery stalk and powder to preserve the meat. Celery powder which apparently is used because of its high nitrate content... So not only do we have these companies say no nitrates added, (it should say no synthetic nitrates at least) but we have them use celery powder that actually had been tested to often contain way more nitrates than using sodium nitrates because it is unregulated where as adding synthetic nitrates they can regulate how much they add to it. Apparently testing has shown absolutely no different in harm or effectiveness for using synthetic vs vegetable nitrates and so I‚Äôm wondering what is the point of using celery powder for curing? Why do we require companies to say no nitrates added it in reality at least the same amount is being used, in fact most likely more. Lastly, from what I can find I haven‚Äôt seen any evidence, but does anyone have info saying anything that would suggest that celery powder is safer or better to use for curing. What‚Äôs your guys thoughts on processed meats in general and their consumption in relation to cancer. Is it the curing process, the type of meat (red vs not red meat) etc. Sorry for the long post hah!"

Chia oil is high smoke point, high omega 3.","From what I understand, some people frown upon using seed/veggie oils for cooking due to their generally high omega 6 to omega 3 ratio, as well as the harmful compounds that form when such oils are heated. How much influence an oil's smoke point has on the formation of harmful compounds seems to be variable--was it [this study](https://actascientific.com/ASNH/pdf/ASNH-02-0083.pdf) saying it doesn't matter much? idk

Anyway, barring the expensive price, **does anyone know whether chia oil is suitable for cooking?** One website has its smoke point listed at a very high value of 486 F (252 C). Yet other websites seem to purposefully *not* list its smoke point and instead say not to heat chia oil at all. Maybe chia oil forms harmful compounds when heated, given that it's mostly polyunsaturated fats (hence its use for boosting omega 3s), with very few monounsaturated fats.

I'm curious if there is an accurate way to measure or calculate the cooked fat content of fatty meats (such as salmon, chicken thighs, steaks, etc)?

I mean, I know keto correctly done is a thing for conditions like epilepsy. 

The body can also certainly adapt to high carb diets (most popular ones) 

But what of the in between? Medium or low or very low

Could we still run eficiently or is there a point where we could be in a sort of limbo of fuel deficiency with no enough carbs but not enough fat being burned as fuel neither? 

3) Is the ketosis state something objective? That is on or off, or it is something smooth where different levels of ketosis can exist based on the amount of carbs you consume? Everywhere, the discussion seems to be you are either in ketosis or not, based on what criteria is that said?"

*""Our stomachs have a knack of knowing when* ***you*** *will* ***eat*** *and starts releasing digestive juices immediately. If* ***you*** *start* ***drinking water*** *at the same time, what* ***you*** *are actually doing is diluting the digestive juices being released to digest your food, thereby hindering them from breaking down food.‚Äù*

nutrition,Hypercalcemia and Mood Regulation,"So, after reading an article on ""[optimisingnutrition.com](https://optimisingnutrition.com/)"" on the effects of minerals and satiety, I determined that my (largely meat-based) keto diet was deficient in calcium. To correct this, I read about calcium from eggshells as a low-calorie fix (400mg per 1g eggshell). Although I did not realize the dose at the time, I was impulsive and ate 20gs of eggshell (8g of calcium total). 

Later that night, I was uncontrollably angry, and borderline violent, which is odd because I'm normally exceptionally calm in stressful situations. It felt like I was watching myself out of control (I've experienced this once before when I was largely copper toxic). Finally, I calculated how much calcium I ate and was quite surprised to realize it was 8g.

A quick google search revealed that hyperparathyroidism, which is associated with elevated blood calcium can also cause people to develop anger issues. Healthline ([https://www.healthline.com/health/hypercalcemia#symptoms](https://www.healthline.com/health/hypercalcemia#symptoms)) lists many neurological symptoms of hypercalcemia. Livestrong [https://www.livestrong.com/article/28213-can-person-overdose-calcium/](https://www.livestrong.com/article/28213-can-person-overdose-calcium/)) claims the tolerable upper limit is 2g for an adult and that muscle twitching is another side effect which I noticed today and yesterday and this morning.

I'm not sure how effective our body is at handling acute megadoses of calcium, so it is possible that eating 8 times the RDA of calcium in a sitting elevated my blood calcium level? If so, is it possible that impacted my mood?"
nutrition,Should sugar be COMPLETELY removed from one's diet?,"I've been looking into the subject of cutting off sugar from one's life, and when trying to learn more about the subject, I realized that when people talk  about ""removing sugar"", they actually mean removing ***added***  sugar from their lives. The terminology ""removing sugar"" greatly confused me, because when delving into the subject and looking at ""no  sugar"" challenges, people merely remove snacks and other extras from their lives.

In the instance of someone having a healthy/balanced diet (i.e, no white sugar/bread/rice, making home-made bread, etc), are small amounts of sugar alright? When checking nutrients contents, I've realized that most foods contain some sugar. An example is this pack of red rice I'm looking at which has 0.6g of sugar in total. Another example, a pack of wholemeal flour I sometimes use has got 2.0g of sugar. 

I'm European, so the way this looks on packages is ""carbohydrates: \[amount\], of which sugar: \[amount\].""

Should sugar be COMPLETELY removed from one's diet, as in not a single trace of it at all anywhere? Or are small amounts alright, or even necessary? I'm trying to understand because the majority of people talking about the subject seem to be Americans trying to rid themselves of excess snacks/processed foods/junk foods, which should go without saying, but they use the terminology ""removing sugar."" After doing some reading, it seems that ""removing sugar"" has a number of health benefits, but I'm still unclear on whether that's ALL sugar or just excess sugar.

So... having said that, what's the deal with sugar?

I keep hearing conflicting things about it.

Every doctor and nutritional expert out there is saying sugar is killing us, etc... but don't we need sugar for energy? The body literally runs on glucose.

In fact, on days where I have a low sugar breakfast and go to the gym, I feel way weaker than on days where I put Nutella on the toast. I'm pretty sure if you send out identical twins on a 5k jog, give one of them a candy bar beforehand, and the other one a piece of meat, the one with the candy bar will win out.

How would having one drink a day (let's say, one shot of tequila) affect the human body, long-term? Would it still cause aging effects? Would it decrease cognitive function or increase the risk of cancer?

Any help would be appreciated! Or any studies that may have covered this specific topic, thanks."

nutrition,How adaptive is metabolism actually?,"This is just out of curiosity as many people tend to blame things on their metabolism and i kinda doubt that ‚Äûmetabolical specialty‚Äú is an actual common reason 


Assuming there is the ‚Äûset point‚Äú at which you can eat slightly more or less without gaining or losing significatly:
If you enter a field of ‚Äûmoderate deficit‚Äú out of that area, you will lose weight,
If you overshoot, your metabolism slows down to retain energy, resulting in a decreased speed of weight loss maintaining the same deficit. Which is why many dieticians recommend eating ‚Äûmore‚Äú for a while, when hitting a plateo.

According to that, a chronically starving/anorectic person would enter a massive plateo very quickly, and gain significantly faster when refeeding, than a normal person with equal surplus of calories (hypothetically)

My questions would be: 

How quickly does ones metabolism adapt (roughly)? Can that be in a day/week/month range? Does it depend on the length of accurate feeding/starvation time beforehands? 

Is it metabolically more affecting to be in a constant calorie deficit (like skipping a meal/ chronical restriction) or to go through waves of severe deficits alternating with overshooting periods (lets look at 3/7 fasting days and 2 overcaloric days for example, or restrictive tendencies with bingeing behavior ).
In other words: bingeing for a chronically starved person would be causing more weight gain than if a metabolically normal person would binge the same amount?

(This is all hypothetically of course, it for sure depends on the individual)

Thanks :)"

nutrition,Seaweed questions,"Hi everyone,

Me and my kids (2.5 and 4.5) love to snack on the Kirkland brand seaweed. We are currently in lockdown again and as I am planning a grocery delivery I'm trying to be a little more thorough because I can't go in person to the store and browse.

Fresh produce is limited and we will only be going to the store every two weeks at most so I'm trying to make sure they still get a varied diet through frozen fruits, and other pre packaged food. Which isn't ideal I know :(

This is what leads me to the questions, what food group would seaweed be in and how much is too much for serving size? The Kirkland package says it's one serving but the three of us get about 2 snack times out of them. 

Hope everyone is healthy and safe during this time!"

nutrition,"Well hey guys. I'm trying to go sugar free for thirty days to just see how that impacts my life, but does that cancel out bread?","So, I heard that bread is essentially a different form of sugar, just a little bit more complex. Brown bread slightly more complex than white.

The simplest and purest form, refined sugar, is supposed to be the baddie here. So I'm assuming that a sugar free diet would allow for a moderate consumption of bread every other day or something?

Or perhaps, I'm entirely wrong and should avoid bread all together if I want to go sugar free.

I've learned a decent amount via popular diet and nutrition books and podcasts, but I wanted to have a more firm grounding in the science, so I went ahead and ordered a bunch of texbooks that I'm making my way through.  Unfortunately the latest editions of these textbooks are often $50-150.  Instead of buying one of these, I've purchaced 6 or 7 of used older editions on Amazon.  They generally date from around 2009 to 2012.  I'm wondering if I'm going to be missing out on much that may have changed in the last 10-ish years?  My assumption is that 98% of the material is up to date, and their may be some additional information that is new but doesn't change the overall thrust of the science.  My thought would be perhaps the biggest of these might be research on the microbiome, but maybe I'm wrong.  I'm wondering if I've made the right choice.  I supposed after I go through these I could pick my favorite text and splurge on the most recent edition, but I also don't want to spend a bunch of money for 98% of the same stuff...  Any suggestions?"

nutrition,"Tracking nutrition, but with disordered eating tendencies","I have a long history of eating disorder behavior with unhealthy restriction and deprivation. I'm SO much better and really don't want nutrition monitoring to make me worse.

I want to track my nutrition to improve my health, but calorie counting is very triggering to my guilt over eating at all. Food being counted in the simplistic categories of only fat, carb, or protein is also offputting. Protein has a connotation as the only acceptable thing to eat out of those groups, even though I logically know better. My mindful vegetables, fruits, fiber, good fats, and lean protein choices being reduced to these three simple groups ignores the good TYPES of foods I am eating.

Is there any nutrition tracker or food diary that can put things in terms of more complex nutrients? Such as fiber, protein, ""good"" fats, ""bad"" fats, complex carbs, simple carbs, protein, possibly even vitamin daily values? Looking at my food this way would be much better for me mentally.

So from then I been trying to increase my calories from 2300 up to 4000 at one point and had to stop cuz I was having diarrhea for three days straight, just to have gotten nothing out of it considering I was still the same weight lmao.

As a vegetarian (religion + choice) and picky eater, it's hard to get all the nutrients. 2) eating very unhealthy because can't cook so relying on eating out and processed foods.

Those 2 things got me thinking, what if I went on like a 60% liquid diet. Because I'm sure a fruit + protein powder + milk smoothie daily is healthier than eating McDonalds twice a week right? Now on this, I would eat solid fruits and veggies and other healthy snacks throughout the day. Probably eat out once or twice a week. So it's not that I'm going full liquid. Background about me. I'm a student and soon I will be going into a career that will require working on average 80 hr/week. That leaves very little time to cook, grocery etc. Never learned to cook and honestly not too too interested in learning. 

I guess my question is. I'm looking to get on a healthier diet. is a 60% liquid diet healthier and more nutrient-rich than what I do right now, which is eating out for probably 50% of my meals - the other 50% being instant noodles, poorly cooked pasta, and barely baked frozen pizza."

What about Omega-6? should we measure all of its quantity as 100% bioavailable?

&amp;#x200B;

On a daily average, without supplementation, I'd get \~20g of Omega-6 compared to \~2g of Omega-3, that's a ratio of 10:1, if all of the Omega-3 was in ALA form, should I measure it as, for example, 0.2g?

nutrition,How much is your BMR able to fluctuate?,"Me and my friend got into an argument concerning obesity. We have reached a common ground that the obesity epidemic is vastly psychological. However, excluding any and all psychological factors, is everyone able to continually eat at a caloric surplus and become obese? 

Eating 50 calories above your TDEE indefinitely produces fat gain, but from some studies and calculations, your BMR will adjust to the extra 50 calories after a weight gain of roughly 3 Kg‚Äôs after 462 days. This results in your TDEE equating to the extra daily 50 calories and zero weight gain subsequently. 

My question is if this scenario was applied to eating 1000 calories above your initial TDEE, would your BMR ever adjust to this extra daily 1000 calories given an infinite timeframe? 
Or is there is theoretical limit to how much your BMR can deviate such that you will continually gain weight until you die of obesity complications?"

Anyone who likes quest protein bars, have you also noticed a difference in taste and size of the bars when you purchase a full 12 batch vs the smaller boxes??

The individuals or ones from a 12pk are wider but more flat and they usually taste better and have an overall better texture. Anyone else know about this? I‚Äôm thinking of just purchasing the larger 12pks because the bars seem to have better quality and different taste.

nutrition,Fistfuls of Fat and Salt Slurpies,"I've eaten carnivorously for approximately 2 months. I've admittedly felt quite good on this diet. I sincerely believe it has cured various ailments, like asthma, poor circulation and limb numbness, and brain fog.

That said, it strikes me as odd that I must consume literally pure fat and pure salt with water on this diet just to feel decent. I can feel okay eating ribeyes with salt, but pure fat and salt water every once in awhile seems more dependable for energy.

The theory of this diet as something more than as an elimination diet (which makes perfect sense to me) is that humans are best adapted to it and therefore thrive on it. I try to paint that picture in my mind and I don't know what it looks like. From what I've read, the idea is that we became amazing hunters and thereby secured sources of animal food which supplies plenty of fat. Yet it seems to me difficult enough today to secure fat in a modern grocery store unless I buy suet, and modern animals are intentionally fattened. I don't think wild animals tend to carry a lot of fat. Moreover, wild animals are not easy to hunt, reducing the net caloric jackpot of catching one. Humans surely did not everywhere live around herds of wooly mammoths and feast at leisure. None of this is even yet to mention that we began as herbivores + bug eaters, so it would make more sense for us to be omnivores (retaining some degree of old machinery, as we have), than for us to not only drop that capability entirely, but actually to be routinely harmed by using it.

The salt problem is also a bit perplexing. I can't imagine prehistoric humans all living by the sea and drinking salt water. There is not even a natural impulse to drink salt water. I'm not sure how to explain that issue in defense of the carnivore diet as more than an elimination diet. Even leading theorists like Saladino simply skirt the issue or say that prehistoric humans probably lived near salt deposits. Is the idea that humans were just like deer who lick salt blocks? It seems more likely to me that some amount of carbohydrates solved this problem. The American Indians are said to have been remarkably healthy before we arrived, and surely they did not all reside near a salt block. Did they not consume carbohydrates?

None of this is to deny that I see the benefits of the diet or struggle to reintroduce carbohydrates.

I'm simply asking--if the theory is that the carnivore diet is not only the perfect elimination diet, but also what we evolved to thrive on, then why does it seem so difficult and somewhat unnatural to secure the few essential ingredients? In which forests was Grog eating fistfuls of fat and salt slurpies?"

Take for example Bob's Red Mill muesli... ingredients are solely whole grain wheat, rolled oats, raisins, almonds and walnuts.

Typically wild sourdough is fermented 4-8hrs and can be refrigerated for a cold ferment overnight for another 12-16hrs for those trying to bake for fresh breads in the morning.

If you were to use instant yeast and ferment the same amount of time, but instead cold ferment for 72hrs, would the phytic acid break down be similar?

For example, almond milk ingredients usually start with- **Ingredients:** Almond milk (filtered water, almonds), evaporated cane juice, etc. Evaporated cane juice comes after almonds, but because ""almond milk"" comes first, is it possible there's less almonds than cane juice and it's just listed first because it's part of a grouped ingredient?

nutrition,Enhancing NAD+ May Restore Age-Related Muscle Degeneration in Human Cells,"Aging is characterized by the imbalance of proteins ‚Äî disrupted proteostasis ‚Äî and mitochondrial function. These features are often seen in age-related degenerative disorders characterized by detrimental protein aggregation like Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and inclusion body myositis (IBM), a progressive muscle disorder. However, how proteostasis collapses in aging muscle is not fully known, and it is unclear whether harmful protein clumps called amyloid deposition, a hallmark of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and IBM, is also at play in the aging muscle.

Romani and colleagues from the Ecole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne in Switzerland published an article in Cell Reports showing that, during natural aging across species, muscle tissues accumulate amyloid-like deposits. Moreover, the researchers discovered the reversible nature of these deposits, which can be reduced by interventions aimed at restoring mitochondrial homeostasis, such as by enhancing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolism, even at the onset of aging.

Importantly, they show that reduction of the accumulation of amyloid-like deposits in aging with NAD+ boosters is sufficient to improve muscle mitochondrial function and beneficially impact health- and lifespan. ‚ÄúDrugs that boost mitochondrial quality control could therefore be tested in the clinic to reverse these age-related proteotoxic aggregates and rejuvenate tissues,‚Äù says Mario Romani, the first author of the study, in a press release.

 I cut open my fish oil capsules in an attempt to guage their quality and noted no smell (could be due to additives) but a slight fishy taste. I did some research before decing on this particular brand which claims their product is of high quality, as confirmed by third party testing (which includes oxidisation) that they have done, but I'm sure that there must be some varience in their stock, especially older stock which I may happen to have. Does anyone have any insight on this matter? 

Also, anyone who has any anecdotal evidence of fish oil/omega 3, I would be pleased to hear it. 

Many thanks"

Obviously eating fat will increase calories, which can cause obesity, but I'm not asking about that.

Are there any studies on this? I've been unable to find any myself, since most online results focus on things like reducing sugar or reducing saturated fat, thanks to the American obesity epidemic.

[The website I was looking at](https://simplyoatmeal.com/how-to-reduce-phytic-acid-in-overnight-oats/) spoke for soaking oats for a minimum of 12 hours (or to work with cooked, sprouted, or fermented oats).

nutrition,Eating fruit on its own,"I feel that the message regarding fruit consumption needs to change. The normal dictate is that having a banana, apple or orange etc on its own is a healthy snack, which it is, but only in comparison to a chocolate bar or sweets that also contain sugar. Bar vitamins, it is essentially just a quick spike of sugar and is going to lead to an increased need to then snack again, on something more filling, which is just more calories. 

Better is to consume fruit with something containing fat and/or protein, to increase satiety. If you are going to snack, the narrative should be to have fruit with nuts or something similar containing fats, to reduce the sugar spike.

Additionally, fruit tastes so much better with something else, as a main meal. 

Peanut butter and sliced banana on toast for breakfast is so much nicer than a banana on its own, is more filling, and will not lead to a spike in sugar from just a banana. You then don't need to snack on the banana on its own later. 

Slices of mango or strawberries thrown into a lunchtime salad is tastier than those fruits on their own.

And an apple crumble topped with nuts, is more delicious than just an apple after the evening meal. 

Essentially I am saying, try to avoid snacking on fruit on its own (and snacking in general from my point of view), but if you are going to always try to combine it with something with fats and protein, to make it a more fulfilling snack."

I've heard that eating brown rice is healthier than eating white, but it's still not a good idea because it's chemically similar to eating sugar (or something along those lines) and contains arsenic as well. It's such an easy staple for me to make, but I am also trying to eat as healthy as I can.

Since then, I am trying to update my understanding of nutrition and learn more.

I wanted to know if anyone on the forum has thoughts about the nutritional value or drawbacks of eating organ meat. I grew up eating chicken liver and onion and liked it, and my friend made me lamb heart last week. I have heard from friends who consider it a ""superfood,"" but I read some articles that highlight concerns with retinol vitamin A consumption in liver.

nutrition,Are the negative effects of too much salt overblown?,"As of 2009 the average sodium consumption in 33 countries was in the range of 2,700 to 4,900 mg/day. This ranged across many cultures, and together with animal studies, this suggests that sodium intake is tightly controlled by feedback loops in the body. This makes recommendations to reduce sodium consumption below 2,700 mg/day potentially futile.

Is it possible the body self regulates when consuming too much salt. Ie when we eat something salty we drink more water and go pee to flush out the excess. 

Could this simply be misleading science similar to the push for lower fat intake of decades ago?

nutrition,Low Fat Plant Based vs Low Carb Keto Study!,"The carbohydrate‚Äìinsulin model of obesity posits that high-carbohydrate diets lead to excess insulin secretion, thereby promoting fat accumulation and increasing energy intake. Thus, low-carbohydrate diets are predicted to reduce ad libitum energy intake as compared to low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets. To test this hypothesis, 20 adults aged 29.9‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1.4 (mean‚Äâ¬±‚Äâs.e.m.) years with body mass index of 27.8‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1.3‚Äâkg‚Äâm‚àí2 were admitted as inpatients to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center and randomized to consume ad libitum either a minimally processed, plant-based, low-fat diet (10.3% fat, 75.2% carbohydrate) with high glycemic load (85‚Äâg‚Äâ1,000‚Äâkcal‚àí1) or a minimally processed, animal-based, ketogenic, low-carbohydrate diet (75.8% fat, 10.0% carbohydrate) with low glycemic load (6‚Äâg‚Äâ1,000‚Äâkcal‚àí1) for 2 weeks followed immediately by the alternate diet for 2 weeks. One participant withdrew due to hypoglycemia during the low-carbohydrate diet. The primary outcomes compared mean daily ad libitum energy intake between each 2-week diet period as well as between the final week of each diet. We found that the low-fat diet led to 689‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ73‚Äâkcal‚Äâd‚àí1 less energy intake than the low-carbohydrate diet over 2 weeks (P‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.0001) and 544‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ68‚Äâkcal‚Äâd‚àí1 less over the final week (P‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.0001). Therefore, the predictions of the carbohydrate‚Äìinsulin model were inconsistent with our observations.

nutrition,Which duckweed species contains vitamin B12?,"Parabel announced that they found B12 in duckweed, but they don't seem to be specific about which species of duckweed. 

It seems that there's Wolffia globosa, a tiny plant [which some say contains B12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30591380/).

And there's something else called Lemnoideae, [which some also say contain B12](https://mariovictorhashiba.medium.com/meet-duckweed-a-plant-based-source-of-b12-62079d9d44dd).

I cannot find a place where Parabel says which specific species they're referring to, can anyone shed some light on this? Is it that both contain B12? Are we to be looking at anything called 'duckweed', or some specific species?

Also, as a side question, [in the announcement](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/parabel-announces-natural-plant-source-of-vitamin-b12-in-water-lentils-and-lentein-plant-protein-300960037.html), they say: 

&gt;Independent third-party laboratory testing has confirmed that Parabel's water lentil crop and the ingredient LENTEIN¬Æ plant protein contain the natural bioactive forms of Vitamin B 12

The wording there suggests that ""Parabel's crop contains B12"". Are Parabel doing something special, or can any duckweed be expected to contain similar amounts of B12?"

 I once had a particularly bad episode and, filled with despair, I decided to buy a coaching service from an ""influencer"" on Instagram.

Usually, I am a really rational person, but my eating disorder led me to being ripped off (they promoted healing from binge eating disorder while losing weight). 

The coaching service was much worse than expected. 
They told me that just nutrition coaching would be useless and I needed to get their personalized training plan too if I wanted to get results.
I asked how to deal with potential urges to binge and they told me not to think about it and just follow the plan. 
I told them that I felt like I needed to eat more and they told me that they couldn't modify my plan if I wanted to get the results I asked for.

I am really angry. 
On the one hand, I know that buying their coaching service was my fault. 
On the other hand, it is totally unacceptable for unqualified Instagram influencers to mislead vulnerable people with eating disorders in order to make money. They accepted to work with me even though I told them I had binge eating disorder and they have literally zero certifications.

 that **you should not combine eating protein and  simple carbs (like rice) in the same meal** so as not to impede the protein absorption (apologies if i am not using the correct scientific jargon).

Increased diversity of plants in the diet (goal: 30 plant species per week, including herbs + spices) leads to increased resilience of microbiome diversity, which leads to systemic resilience.

[https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/worldmicrobiomeday-2020-defending-gut-microbiota-diversity-for-better-health/](https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/worldmicrobiomeday-2020-defending-gut-microbiota-diversity-for-better-health/)

Nutrition is a complex, highly \[body-place\]-specific science. It's inaccessible to many working-class people (lack of time for studying and/or background for research interpretation, etc.), which leads to reliance on group-think (e.g., the AIP diet or the Paleo diet). So, increasing the diversity of plants in the diet feels like a great, simple place to start that requires almost no direction, excepting cases of medical necessity.

Intuitively, diet diversity makes sense. How do you increase the health of any ecosystem? Assist resurgence of regenerative systems through biodiversity. Supporting the more sensitive, niche species of bacteria in our gut requires a rhythmic undertaking of stitching complexity into a simple (read: processed) diet. Increasing diversity of plants naturally leads us to increase the diversity of places we go to find or buy plants. This might lead us to a farmer's market to speak with a community farmer for the first time. And then we might get interested in the food system, which will lead us to increased diversity of information. All because of plants! I love plants.

nutrition,How to balance the blood sugar level by eating healthy,"[Ourbeautyhealth](https://ourbeautyhealth.com/2021/01/16/diabetes/)

 Instead of going on a completely sugar-free diet, now beat diabetes/blood sugar by putting these on your plate‚Ä¶

Apple Peel:¬† Apply peels that have sugar reducing powers. They contain quercetin, a flavonoid that has antioxidant effects that help in reducing diabetes. So when snacking on the fruit, remember to eat it whole. Apples come in many varieties. No matter which variety you choose, the benefits are equally high.

Asparagus: Asparagus is an excellent source of glutathione an antioxidant compound that is known to keep blood sugar stable. The edible parts of the stalk are the shoots that appear underground, so choose those that are tender and green.

Beans: Most members of the legume family contain phytonutrients that are not only good for the heart but will also help you battle diabetes. The best way to take full advantage of these is by consuming dried beans that have been soaked in water for several hours before cooking. Think rajma, chole, etc.

Oranges: This perky fruit is not just another pretty looker about town. It‚Äôs packed with phytonutrients that can help you fight diabetes including flavonoids, carotenoids, terpenes, pectins, and glutathione. It rates low on the glycemic index, which means it does not affect blood glucose levels highly, making the orange a good friend to have.

Broccoli: Broccoli is easily available at most specialty food stockists. It is an excellent source of quercetin which will help you in your war against rising blood sugar. So blanch it for your salad or puree it for the soup.

Carrots: Have you heard of a rabbit with diabetes? it‚Äôs probably because of all the carrots they munch. Joke apart, these vegetables are not only good for your eyes, like your mother said, but also full of carotenoids that can help balance your insulin levels.

Nuts: Nuts are power-packed with minerals and healthy fats that protect your heart and balance sugar. Go nuts!

nutrition,"Looking for multi-vitamins, supplements, &amp; caffein suggestions to help my adhd meds &amp; mental health. I‚Äôd love any advice","

My current  medication is 30mg of vyvance and 10mg of adderall IR combined. Full 20mg adderall made me a hypochondriac and if I had caffein/sometimes w out caffein I‚Äôd have panic attacks and my vision would be blurry. Lower medication dosages didn‚Äôt help my adhd symptoms. I felt depressed and felt like I couldn‚Äôt concentrate still. So I decided to get vyvance and adderall so my medication can kick in early and hopefully it will work better this way.

Sometimes I struggle going to sleep on adhd meds. I could sleep if I put my head down but I tend to feel glued to my phone as time passes. I got melatonin to help so my sleep schedule doesn‚Äôt get super messed up. Or I could have sleep tea I guess but melatonin has helped my sleep schedule and I‚Äôve stopped getting sleep paralysis.

I decided that in the morning I‚Äôll take the adderall and vyvance right away. I‚Äôll hopefully remember to drink water. Than about 30 minutes later. Than I‚Äôll eat a meal that includes protein. I decided to eat vegan/gluten free now in case anything is contributing to my symptoms. 

I decided that mid day I‚Äôll have matcha or green tea which helps anxiety and depression symptoms and adhd. I decided to stop having coffee or gluten u less it‚Äôs a day where I‚Äôm really doing nothing.

Than before bed I will take my omega 3 pill if I didn‚Äôt get enough omega 3 that day from flax seed/ezecial bread/vegan butter/etc. Bc not enough omega 3 can cause brain issues. I‚Äôll than take my nutrafelle nutramin  vitamins which are a multi vitamin with vitamin A, C,D3,E,,B6, folic acid, B12,biotin, iodine, zinc, choline. I think I‚Äôll also have an Emergen-C vitamin packet drink before bed bc those are good vitamins plus they should help cancel adhd meds bc of the acidic. I also have magnesium gummies that I might start taking 4 before bed- I‚Äôm not sure if I should split it up and have something in the morning but I don‚Äôt feel super anxious in the am w out coffee


I feel like the medications kind of make me lose the bubbly part of myself but I can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs true bc I haven‚Äôt been out with people. I feel like there is no consistency with me on medication and it feels different and I feel shitty everyday. So I guess I‚Äôm trying to be as healthy as possible. Usually I give up on health at some point. After some time on adhd meds a lot of the time my healthy routines and lifestyle dies down and I become depressed and a mess although my narcissist parents seem to effect my mental health negatively. 

Today for breakfast I ate a store bought frozen a√ßa√≠ bowl (160 cal) it came w coconut chunks and stuff but I added a large spoon of peanut butter for protein. For lunch I had matcha, flax sprouted Ezekiel bread with vegan butter that contains omega 3 and I had a bag of peanuts on the side that were 190 cal. I feel like I got good healthy fat/ fruit/ protein. For dinner I should probably have vegetables and gf carbs and some more protein- maybe lentil soup."

nutrition,Am I missing something with berries and vitamin C?,"So I went down the rabbit hole of how Polyphenols block iron absorption, and then read how vitamin C's iron absorption boosting capabilities that everyone knows about can outweigh/counteract the polyphenols impact. It listed higher doses of vitamin C to achieve this desired end result but I realized something: berries are pretty dang high in polyphenols, and although the internet likes to say they're high in vitamin C, they really aren't that high of a dose for this polyphenol-iron relationship according to everything I'm reading on Google scholar:

&gt;The aims of this study were to examine whether small amounts of EGCG, GSE and green tea extract (GT) could inhibit heme iron absorption, and to test whether the inhibitory action of polyphenols could be offset by ascorbic acid. A heme-55Fe absorption study was conducted by adding various concentrations of EGCG, GSE and GT to Caco-2 cells in the absence and presence of ascorbic acid. Polyphenolic compounds significantly inhibited heme-55Fe absorption in a dose-dependent manner. **The addition of ascorbic acid did not modulate the inhibitory effect of dietary polyphenols on heme iron absorption when the cells were treated with polyphenols at a concentration of 46 mg/L. However, ascorbic acid was able to offset or reverse the inhibitory effects of polyphenolic compounds when lower concentrations of polyphenols were added (‚â§ 4.6 mg/L)**. Ascorbic acid modulated the heme iron absorption without changing the apical heme uptake, the expression of the proteins involved in heme metabolism and basolateral iron transport, and heme oxygenase activity, indicating that ascorbic acid may enhance heme iron absorption by modulating the intracellular distribution of¬†55Fe. These results imply that the regular consumption of dietary ascorbic acid can easily counteract the inhibitory effects of low concentrations of dietary polyphenols on heme iron absorption but cannot counteract the inhibitory actions of high concentrations of polyphenols.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3306181/


So here's my confusion... Berries can have anywhere between 150~500mg of polyphenols per *half* cup depending on the berry. Yet a half cup of blackberry, raspberry, or blueberry has only like, ~15-25mg of vitamin C.

I understand that polyphenols have amazing health benefits, that's all I've known them for, and nobody talks about this iron blocking mechanism (besides in green tea). Am I just too tin-foil hatted right now? Can I still enjoy my banana-berry-overnight oats and feel okay about getting a decent start on my daily iron?"

nutrition,Is the daily consumption of protein from animal-based sources dangerous?,"Hi everyone, we know the important role that protein covers for people who exercise, but in order to reach the recommended daily intake these people (generally) have to rely heavily on animal-based proteins, including in their daily diets one or more between these foods: meat (in particular chicken), fish, eggs, dairies (in particular greek yogurt, cottage cheese, whey protein) among others.

I know that are also protein based sources, like all the nuts and seeds, grains, beans and lentils, some vegetables like peas, spinach, kale for example, and that they should definitely be inclued in an healthy diet, but i guess that the biggest source of protein from people who exercise generally comes from eating, if not daily, almost, one or more between meat, fish, eggs and dairies.

Is the daily consumption of protein from animal-based sourced dangerous? Can it have any effect on health? 

If it is, how can someone who does weight-lifting for example, realistically reach its daily protein intake without relying daily on one of these categories of food?

Or there is no evidence of problem with daily consumption of animal-based protein?

nutrition,Question abouts nuts and seeds and the different ways they can be eaten: raw vs roasted vs soaked // ground vs whole," 

Hi guys.

Is  there an important difference between the ways you can eat your nuts  (walnuts, pistachios, peanuts, almonds, cashews) and seeds (chia,  pumpkin, flax, sunflower, hemp, sesame)?

Is it important to choose wethere raw or roasted? Does it make an important difference if someone is eating nuts/seeds raw instead of roasted (or viceversa)? Should this distinction be considered when buying/eating them or it doesn't really matter?

And  what about soaking? i've read that soaking might help lower phytic acid (which seems to be an anti-nutrient that makes it more difficult to  absorb minerals like zinc and iron in the dish you're having) contained  in nuts and seeds and makes them easier to digest (so better absorption  of nutrients). But i've read different ideas on whether it is important or not to do it.

Should nuts and/or seeds be soaked (if yes, which?) or it doesn't really matter as  long as they're being eaten, no matter in which way?

And  finally, what about ground vs whole? I just recently found that  flaxseeds need to be grinded to be digested, but does this apply to anything else?

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to know if these are important things to consider or if instead they don't really matter that much.

Is that adequate or are you missing certain nutrients by not consuming other food groups like fermented foods, nuts/seeds, mushrooms, avocados, spices like tumeric...etc?

nutrition,Dietary requirement for bulk?,"Hello, I'm looking into ketogenic eating and one thing that's struck me in particular is seeing just how many calories there are in pure fat sources (avocado oil, ghee etc.).

I am also interested in Buddhism and have been toying romantically with the idea of eating one bowl of food per day.

My question is kind of one of general nutrition.  Suppose I were to make a soup that fell within keto macros and which had a massive amount of calories from fat such that one good bowl of it would contain around 2k calories.  Say it had some meat and a good variety of veggies as well.

Is there any particular reason why this wouldn't be a viable option in the longer-term?  This obviously would consist of quite a bit less food in terms of pure pounds eaten per day, but theoretically you could still be eating the same amount of calories and be getting a good amount of vegetable intake for micronutrients.  Does the body specifically need food bulk in addition to nutrition and calories for anything, or would it potentially do fine on a diet like that, assuming one were well-adapted to ketogenic eating and made sure to cycle between lots of types of veggies?"
nutrition,Help on truly understanding nutrition and calories.,"I'm currently trying to educate myself on nutrition and eating healthier/better.

Eating 4 king-size milky way bars will get you to \~1800 calories, the same way eating meals that are made up with ideal macros for protein, carb, and fat.

&amp;#x200B;

 What I am trying to get at is I keep seeing it doesn't matter what you eat as long as you eat within your caloric bounds, but does the mass of what you eat apply to this as well? Will eating a smaller amount of calorically dense amount of food that even goes over your limit still allow you to lose weight as it isn't giving your body enough mass, macros, or nutrients?

nutrition,If you're taking high dose of Vitamin D what else should you be taking?,"I've learned that the following work together..

- Calcium

- Vit D (4000 IU)

- Magnesium 

- Vit K1/K2

- Zinc

- B6



I've learned that if you take high vitamin D then you need to take vit K1/K2 as vit D increase blood calcium levels but may result in weaker bones if you are not consuming enough calcium. But vit K increase bone absorption and as a result undo that problem.

I've learned similar thing about Magnesium. It also increases bone absorption of calcium and also enhance vit D. (wait doesn't that mean Magnesium is better than Vit k??)

Calcium competes with Magnesium absorption however most people get enough of it and don't need supplementation.

Which leaves zinc, which doesn't look like you need to take if you are taking high dose of vitamin D, unless you're low on it.

B6: separate thing and works best with zinc but not related to vit D.

nutrition,Nutrient density of greens?,"Greens are nutrient dense. One such class of nutrients is fat soluble vitamins like A. Eaten in excess, these vitamins can be deleterious to health. Why then is it considered healthy to eat greens practically ad libitum?"
nutrition,Is a low carb diet still successful at improving insulin resistance if you're eating NOT complex carbs but in small quantities?,"I know Ideally that complex carbs are better for everyone especially those dealing with insulin resistance. But would consuming a ""not complex carb"" source (white flour, white rice or pasta) for one meal in small quantity while having the rest of the day without high carb sources (salads and protein) be equal as having meals with small amounts of complex carbs throughout the day?

Basically, is low carb a matter of ""quantity""? or does a low carb not help insulin resistance unless it's ""quantity + quality"" ?"

I see various places on reddit suggest say 1.6g / kg bodyweight although I think this is more for gaining muscle / strength than for ordinary health. For ordinary people not doing heavy manual jobs or really serious sport is there a ""healthy range"" for protein intake? Does it depend on age? or type of protein?"

That's how i've always been doing it, but i wonder, from a nutritional point of view am i missing out on some nutrients that go down the sink when i'm draining that water?

Should i perhaps cook it differently (steam it, make it absorb the water, or other options i can't think of), or maybe it's better to buy a different type of rice?

nutrition,"Is there a resource that groups vegetables (or any food) by nutrition categories and characteristics, visually?","Such as a chart, table or database. (A db isn't visual but can be made to be)

For example, a chart that lists on one axis things like:

* List of vitamins
* List of other nutrients
* List of antioxidants
* Lists of other known valuable compounds
* Etc.

And then on the other axis it lists the vegetables, and then has either a checkmark to indicate that it is present, or even better a value of how much, so you can see which foods have what at a glance.

I'm having a difficult time parsing all of the information out there on the web about the health value of food because the word ""healthy"" is so loaded. One website prioritizes vitamins, another prioritizes anti-oxidants, another one talks about compounds I've never heard of and why I should care about them... it's a huge mess and a research-backed visual guide would be extremely helpful."

nutrition,Determining Food Intolerances,"Just wondered whether it was possible to determine food intolerances with blood tests.

I found a site where they do [food intolerance IgG blood tests](https://www.yorktest.com/products/food-drink-scan-test/)

I was reading about their validity though and found [this article](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/igg-food-intolerance-tests-what-does-the-science-say/) which makes it sound like those tests aren't a particularly great indication of intolerances and might even indicate things you're tolerant too??

The company I linked to that does the tests mentions [testing for IgG (1-4) as opposed to just IgG4](https://www.yorktest.com/what-is-igg/), so not sure if that would make it more accurate?

Anyway, I was just wondering whether anyone knows about the accuracy of these tests, has any experience with them, or whether an elimination diet is the only real way of finding out intolerances to foods?

I'll be honest, it can be quite challenging to get myself to drink water. I still drink it, especially when I work out but for daily consumption I notice that I can go a day or two without drinking any but when I started drinking Sparkling water from the Clear american brand, it's something I do tend to drink a little more of but I was just curious if it was really a healthy alternative.

According to the ingredients, it reads Carbonated Water, Citric Acid, Natural Flavor, Potassium Citrate, Potassium Benzoate (Preservative), Aspartame, and Acesulfame Potassium. 

Now I'm not too knowledgeable with most of these ingredients besides Aspartame but I tend to read lots of different opinions on it. Some say it's alright, some say it's bad. So I'm not really sure what to think.

Eating \~2000 kcals of Mcdonalds makes sense, the macros ingested won't be able to build muscle, make you feel awful and you probably won't want to burn off the excess calories etc.

Context:

PS derived from cow brains has shown to be able to improve memory and cognition but due to concerns of mad-cow disease, it's not longer available. Most PS supplements are made from soybeans or other plants but they seem to lack cognitive benefits or at least not as effective. One main difference between soybean derived PS and cow brain derived PS is the absence of DHA. The paper linked is to study the effects of a PS-DHA conjugate developed as an alternative to mimic the cow brain derived PS.

nutrition,"Is giving up sugar for artificial sweeteners ideal, or would it be like getting rid of an addiction for another addiction?","The idea of artificial sweeteners intrigues me because it tastes like sugar but without the calories, but if the idea is to ween off sugar, then wouldn't it be counterintuitive?
I've heard that people should ween of soft drinks by drinking diet soft drinks instead, which makes no sense to me personally.

Apparently we have become so accostumed to sugar to be able to enjoy an apple, people who don't consume sugar say things like ""fruits begin to taste like candy"". If you replaced sugar with an artificial sweetener, would the same thing happen? Or would you still think an apple is tasteless?
If your goal is to eat an apple like candy, wouldn't using to artificial sweeteners, just do the same thing as normal sugar?"

nutrition,What foods are highest in magnesium?,"hello!!  


wondering where to get the most magnesium. I know to eat sprouted nuts, seeds, and beans, and to eat leafy greens. but I can't get myself to eat those every day, so I'm looking for other dense foods I can use as supplements. I need supplemental magnesium, but I prefer whole food sources.  


So far I've found moringa powder (which 100grams is around 365mg magnesium) and cacao (which has up to 450mg magnesium per 100 grams). I've been thinking I could just take them easily with some oblaat instead of magnesium pills.

nutrition,A Nutrition Guide for Memory Loss Care and Prevention,"Memory problems are a major issue facing senior adults in the United States. In fact, as many as 40% of U.S. adults over the age of 65 experience memory impairments as they age. On top of being inconvenient or frustrating, memory loss can have a variety of health consequences, ranging from minor issues to potentially life-threatening problems ‚Äî including malnutrition.

Malnutrition is one of the most common and serious risks associated with memory impairments in senior adults. In addition to natural processes, like the slowing of your metabolism and decreased nutrient absorption, memory impairments of any kind can make it difficult for them to get the nutrients they need to thrive.

My main question is just why might it take someone a long time to recover from electrolyte imbalance when in theory iy should be very quickly remedied by the right diet.

Hi, so basically i drunk an obscene amount of water for a seriously long time. I have other chronic health stuff so thought my condition was just worsening until shit got really bad and doctors and paramedics were called and we realised what was happening.

i i am getting plenty of medical advice and in constant talk with my doc. Bloods are all taken just waitibg for results. Im not looking for medical advice here. Maybe just some insight into whats going on in tbe body. And how it all works in regards to nutrition.

I was doing this intenselt and getting bad symptoms for around 4 months +. But it may go back even further. We are talking like 6-9L a day varying month to month abd day to day. Its a long story why i was drinking that much.


I am now on restricted fluids and doing all that docs recommend etc to remedy this.

I basically have extreme neurological symptoms which got to a peak which required paramedics. That was 6 days ago and things are getting better now ive cut fluids and stuff, but i still have got ringing in ears, white static behind eyes, extremely intolerant to stimulation (typing this feels like iys burning my brain out). So you get the picture i am really fucked up from this. + just loads of other awful symptoms. 

When i look online for a timeline of how this works mant people just seem to say it takes a couple of days to balance out. Yet none of my doctors are suprised that this is taking this long. I wonder what is going on in my body? How come homeostasis is taking so long. It doesnt surprise me but sometimes when the symptoms peak up again i get a bit anxious and stuff. Just wondering if anyone had some info on how this all works. Im guessing i also have a lot of mineral deficienc8es due to washing them out, but the doctor said that should remedy very quickly."

nutrition,20 Delicious High Protein Foods List," Protein makes up the building blocks of organs, muscles, skin, and hormones. Your body needs protein to maintain and repair tissues. Studies have shown that eating protein can also help you lose weight and belly fat while increasing your muscle mass and strength. A diet that is high in protein may also help lower blood pressure, fight diabetes, and more health benefits.   The Reference Daily Intake for protein is 46 grams for women and 56 grams for men. However, many health and fitness experts believe you need more than that to function optimally."

nutrition,fish oil supplements are a scam and here is why,"A high dose of high end fish oil pills (being 4 pills) contains

|Omega 3 fatty acids|616 mg|
|:-|:-|
|EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid)|192 mg|
|DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)|292 mg|

100 grams of salmon contains

|Omega 3 fatty acids|4200 mg|
|:-|:-|
|EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid)|775 mg|
|DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)|2253 mg|

100 grams of herring (aka *Clupea harengus membras*) contains:

|Omega 3 fatty acids|1400 mg|
|:-|:-|
|EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid)|402 mg|
|DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)|606 mg|

100 grams of vendace (aka cisco aka *Coregonus albula*)  contains:

|Omega 3 fatty acids|1400 mg|
|:-|:-|
|EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid)|294 mg|
|DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)|306 mg|

100 grams of pollock (saithe aka *Pollachius virens*) contains:

|Omega 3 fatty acids|400 mg|
|:-|:-|
|EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid)|102 mg|
|DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)|280 mg|

From the craft below (which is build from the data above) you can see that just 25 grams of salmon per day will give you the same amount of EPA as 4 fish oil pills, which will cover you with more than enough of omega 3 and DHA.

||goal amount|fish oil supplement|salmon|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Omega 3 fatty acids|616 mg|4 pills|15 grams of salmon|
|EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid)|192 mg|4 pills|25 grams of salmon|
|DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)|292 mg|4 pills|13 grams of salmon|

I included the data on other fish also, to show that with every which, serving under 100 grams is well enough to provide you more than enough of omega 3, EPA and DHA, compared to the fish oil supplements.

I calculated, using a website that sells this supplants (15,77 ‚Ç¨ per 100 pills), that a dose of 4 pills of this supplements costs 0,60 ‚Ç¨, which is 0.8 $. In my local super market salmon cots 8 ‚Ç¨ per kilogram (which is 8.9 $) so with that 0.8 $ which you would have put on this supplement, you could have bought 75 grams of salmon. Notice that 75 grams is 3 times the amount of salmon you would have needed to match the supplement, and for this reason I conclude that fish oil supplements are a scam.

nutrition,Prospective randomized controlled trials on diet -- why are they so rare?,"I came across this study recently and it got me thinking:

[A criticism of RCTs in diet](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4863268/)

The author's criticisms are laughable in comparison to the profound and unavoidable Type 1 and Type 2 errors that fill most of epidemiological based research, which is the majority of food science. They are interesting points in and of themselves and certainly should be taken into account anytime one is doing good research, but no comparison. Like criticizing the cupholders in a Tesla while epidemiology is akin to a Ford Pinto that can't even start on a cold day.

As an example, look at this study of intragastric balloons for weight loss, a horribly invasing procedure that is often done as a last resort for those who have almost no other option:

[Intra gastric balloons - RCT](https://www.reshapelifesciences.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/REDUCE_Pivotal_Trial_Article-Ponce.pdf)

Does this have the same issues as a dietary study would? Yes. Did the authors still manage to do an effective study? Yes. With things that don't lead to profit, it's almost as if we're not even trying.

Take keto for example -- to date, there are only a few dozen RCTs of its impact:

[32 RCTs of keto](https://paleofoundation.com/ketogenic-diet-randomized-controlled-trials-rcts-research-review/)

In the context of food science as a whole, this is a paltry sum. 

Also -- the idea that dietary studies are unethical is one of the best smokescreens the food and agricultural industries have put out there -- complete misinformation and propaganda.

If we objectively knew that something was the best treatment -- like antibiotics for an infection or setting a broken bone -- then yes, to do something that we were sure was less effective would be unethical. Again think to the gastric balloon study above. Tell me, that's ethical while food elimination diets are not? And providing someone's diet during a study would be far cheaper than a surgical procedure any day of the week.

We really have **no idea** with diet. Keto, Paleo, Atkins, Vegan, Carnivore, Fruitarian, *any one* of these could be the best. Epidemiology has only confused the situation further. Can you imagine a field of research stagnating over a half century? At this point, it's not food science, it's food philosophy. Trying to do the same thing again and again without result 

In scenarios of uncertainty, the only way forward is prospective randomized double blinded multi center trials. Otherwise you're stuck with *a priori* reasoning and analogy. Inductive reasoning. A really ineffective way to develop theories. This is where superstition and religious fundamentalism is born. That's why it's such a cluster f to try and debate approaches.

Prospective studies are how we figured out retroviral combinations for AIDS or chemotherapy combinations for cancer. We didn't just refuse to experiment because we had a treatment that ""kind of"" worked. And as it stands, current dietary recommendations ""kind of"" don't work at all.

The ethics argument is meant to obscure the real reason these studies haven't been done: *the food and agricultural industries.* Their lobbies and capital influence are massive, and they strongly pressure the NIH **to not award grants to research that suggests their food is bad for you**. Proponents of each say, ""Well why is the meat industry stronger than the fruit industry? Shouldn't these conflicting interests cancel out?"" It doesn't quite work like this. Instead of cancelling out, they both suppress. The research doesn't get done. A scientist doesn't want to hamstring his career getting in between these titans.

This goes for both sides of the camp -- the dairy, egg, agricultural, meat industries. Got Milk, Beef it's What's for Dinner, etc. If you had a multibillion dollar industry and you were a producer, wouldn't you pool with your competitors to fund a commercial campaign and lobby? Why wouldn't you? In the capitalistic system, the goal is to win.

All of them do the same dirty underhanded nonsense. They learned from the best -- Big Tobacco did this to devastating effect for most of the 20th century. Big Food is filled with the same jerks. *It is impossible to convince a man of a fact if his pocketbook depends on him believing the opposite.*

As an example of a food science belief that I have: I don't think the genetic sugar filled mutants that we call fruit are good for almost anyone other than those who have issues metabolizing fat (PEMT variants not taking choline etc.) But this is *inductive reasoning* based on a handful of my patients that were willing to get genetic testing and carefully track their diets -- even then when you have a specific genetic make up, it doesn't mean your genes are necessarily ""turned on"". *We know so, so little without randomized prospective studies*.

I remember trying to get nutritional research funded for fatty liver with funding included for their diet and purchases tracked via their smartphones; both journal editors and my lab director just laughed in my face when I submitted research proposals.

""Interesting idea. Who's gonna pay for this?"" with a knowing smirk. No one would.

""Sure if you'll work for free.""

""How are you going to stop people from cheating?"" (literally a criticism that can be applied to any drug, diet or behavioral modification study in existence).

It takes about a billion dollars to bring a drug from bench to bedside when you tally up the tabs, research and trial costs. Roughly a few hundred million dollars to do an effective diet study on a large scale (you would save a portion of the benchside fees).

The thing we know definitively works for longevity and general health in the average person is caloric restriction. But we don't know how much and how you get here. It's just anecdotes -- ""I found this works"" and ""I found this doesn't work.""

I think we're going to look back on this time in food science as part of its dark ages. I hope we can change this."
nutrition,Does recommended daily intake account for bioavailability?,"So about a week ago, I started a new diet to try and put on some mass. A ""dirty bulk"", if you will. Among other foods, I'm ingesting a little over 2 litres (half a gallon) of whole milk (getting enough calories through other means is pretty difficult for me, but drinking milk feels almost like cheating). 

I've read some things about how it is possible to intake too much calcium, which can lead to hypercalcemia, kidney stone formation, Milk-alkali syndrome, etc. As per the nutrition table on my jug of milk, I'm getting about 2500mg of calcium, which is pretty much exactly the recommended upper limit. 

My question: Does this 2500mg upper limit take into account the fact the the bioavailability of milk is around 30%? So in actuality, my body is only able to absorb about 750mg? Am I good to go ahead with this kind of diet?

Any other tips would also be greatly appreciated."

nutrition,Question regarding the storage of vitamins and minerals in the body.,"I love to train with weights and calisthenics. Because of this I have always valued my nutrition. Every day I make sure to hit my calorie, macronutrient and vitamin/mineral targets as best as I can, as well as antioxidants and the like. One day I was thinking how strange our modern abundance of food is, how we have access to every fruit and vegetable in surplus almost all year round. I thought about how horrible it must have been before this was the case. This led me to a string of questions I would love to ask:

How did people stay healthy during the winter months(colder climates) when fruits and vegetables were scarce? I know that preserved foods retain some of their value, but still, not a lot of their vitamins, surely, and meat can provide some of these along with minerals but not all of them. Excess grain and dairy bolstered people's diets. Still, I feel like I'm missing something key here.

I read that the body stores fat soluble vitamins in, well, fat of course, and stores some in the liver. How long do these stored vitamins last? Do minerals get stored in the same way? 

And vitamin C, the perplexing little fellow, the body does not produce or store this vitamin. I also don't know of any non-plant sources of it. How did people get this? Is it not essential? 

I know that this may seem like a bunch of loosely related questions, but I swear it feels like it's all part of the same thing really. I'd like to hear what you beautiful people have to say about this."

I am shooting for a high fiber and protein diet and one of the ways I do that is by eating well cooked quinoa. I do notice that a black version of that quinoa seems to come out in my stool.

I‚Äôve been in two different college programs so far (unrelated to nutrition) and left both before finishing. I‚Äôve been mentally ill for a long time and ever since leaving high school (where I was an A student) my motivation feels like it dropped to the point of no return. I wasted money and time and it‚Äôs really a sore spot in my life. 

I do however love nutrition. I love health facts. It‚Äôs been an increasing passion of mine because it‚Äôs helping so many different areas of my life I thought I was stuck in (bad acne is clearing, mental clarity, less depression). Nutrition is probably the only thing I voluntarily research without being prompted to. I never researched the subjects of the other two programs I‚Äôve been in, unless I was forced to for a project. 

I didn‚Äôt clue into this until my therapist suggested I go into nutrition based on how excited I was sharing health facts with her. She said she hasn‚Äôt seen me be as passionate in anything else (and I‚Äôve been seeing her through the programs I left too). 

I know the Canadian School of Natural Nutrition and their titles are not regulated and it‚Äôs better to go into dietetics. The problem is, I seriously doubt I will be able to accomplish a full time long term program with my lack of motivation. The CSNN program is favourable to me because I‚Äôll get a basic knowledge of nutrition, it can be done online, can be completed in one year. And if I manage to complete it and my passion grows, then I would look into dietetics. 

So TLDR; is it ok to do CSNN and then dietetics, or is there another short term program/certificate/diploma in Canada that would be more useful to me?"

nutrition,Want to drink 1gallon+ water a day but worried about electrolyte loss,"Hey, wanna drink a lot of water for satiety to help curb hunger while reducing my calories. 

I got a lot of foot cramps the first day i tried this which worried me and so i researched about water intoxication and realized electrolytes are being washed out. 
The water I was drinking was purified bottled water which may have played a part. Is it better with tap water?

Also this is on an empty stomach, i dont eat until later in the day towards the evening. So do I need electrolytes?

Also i had a very high sodium diet, so maybe my body is still expecting that amount of sodium.

Should i take electrolytes? Does swallowing some table salt do the trick?"

[This](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5541280/#idm139696351250192title) (""The Big Vitamin D Mistake"") is the kind of research I have in mind:

Another study confirmed that 6201 IU/d was needed to achieve 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/d was needed to reach 100 nmol/L.

I‚Äôve also read that rinsing rice removes many of the micronutrients, then also read rinsing rice is a must to remove contaminants such as arsenic in brown rice.

However, do the words ""Whole"" or ""Multigrain"" on a product mean it's healthier than an alternative without those words, **even when the nutrition facts are basically the same**? Do whole-grain products have nutritional advantages over competitors that aren't listed in the nutrition facts? 

For instance, take these two bags of tortilla chips.

then I search on the USDA food central...

I gathered the vitamin A info into a table for your easy understanding!

&amp;#x200B;

||**Unpeeled**|**Peeled**|**Deriv. By**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Vitamin A, RAE|5¬µg|4¬µg|Calculated|
|Retinol|0¬µg|0¬µg|Assumed zero (Insignificant amount or not naturally occurring in a food, such as fiber in meat)|
|Carotene, beta|45¬µg|31¬µg|Analytical|
|Carotene, alpha|11¬µg|8¬µg|Analytical|
|Cryptoxanthin, beta|26¬µg|18¬µg|Taken from another source--other tables of food composition|
|Vitamin A, IU|105IU|72IU|Calculated|

&amp;#x200B;

In my understanding,

* 1 IU = 0.3 mcg RAE/  0.6 mcg beta-carotene
* 1 mcg RAE = 12 mcg beta-carotene
* 1 mcg RAE = 24 mcg alpha-carotene

When I refer to the international unit, there is 33 IU (105IU-72IU) less in peeled than the unpeeled cucumber, is that mean there should have 9.9 mcg (33 IU x 0.3 mag) difference in Vitamin A, RAE?

But the row of ""Vitamin A, RAE""  is a totally different story, as they have only 1mcg (5mcg- 4mcg) difference....

Plus, if 1 IU = 0.6 mcg beta-carotene is true, there should have 63 mcg (105 IU x 0.6 mcg) in **Unpeeled** cucumber....

Things that can replace a steak dinner for example which he can‚Äôt have much of. He barely started this new diet and it‚Äôs hard to plan a nice meal with limited food options.
nutrition,Vitamin D fortification,"I live in Canada where Vitamin D fortification is in place.  This solved many problems due to our lack of sunshine during the long winters.  

Now, I was wondering what are the large countries that do not do vitamin D fortification?  

Sorry if it‚Äôs not the right place to ask this question.  This is my first post."
nutrition,Nutrition of orange peels,"I'm curious about the nutrition content of orange peels, and how many orange peels equal the orange slices inside of the orange? For instance, how many orange peels will content the equivalent value of vitamin C that the orange slices do? Are there other nutrients that the peel is superior/inferior compared to the slices?"
nutrition,I want to be a certified Nutritionist,"Hey all!

Looking to become a certified nutritionist as I grow my meal prep company.

Does anyone have any recommendations of the best route to take? NASM? Something else? 

Should I use online resources or enroll in a local technical college?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is welcome and appreciated!

Thanks all!"
nutrition,Folate content of legumes/sprouted legumes/dried sprouted legumes,"Hi all, I hope I‚Äôm posting this in the right place. Legumes are a rich source of folate. When sprouted, much of that folate is converted to methylfolate. One way to get sprouted legumes is to sprout them yourself or buy them freshly sprouted. I‚Äôve also seen dried sprouted lentils for sale; I assume these are lentils that have been fresh sprouted and then dried. My question is, does the drying process have any effect on the methylfolate content? In other words, how do fresh ‚Äúmoist‚Äù sprouted legumes compare to dried sprouted legumes in terms of methylfolate content?"
nutrition,How much sodium do I really need?,"I‚Äôve heard the recommend 2,300 and even more but I‚Äôve also heard it varies for skin color?"
nutrition,Best Omega 369 Gummies?,"I'm new to virtually all Omega dietary supplements/gummies but I'm now looking into which proper vitamins etc. to take for my respiratory health. However, I don't want to take extra LARGE supplement pills so I'm looking for something simple like gummies. Any recommendations?"

# The Subreddit Rules

***Note: Avoid asking for exemptions since the rules and moderation should be applied fairly and equally to all. Fully read any response you receive from a mod, including automoderator, before messaging for an appeal.***

**1) No dietary activism for or against any diet** - Diet wars are NOT welcome here. Crusading is usually off topic and often intended to be inflammatory. Participants in this subreddit have a variety of dietary requirements, beliefs, body types, and goals. Being a diet fan is fine.  Being a jerk fan or jerk anti-fan of a diet is not okay and will result in a ban.  **DO NOT**;

* **engage disrespectfully towards other diets/beliefs** - inform instead. Talk TO them, not ABOUT the other person / group,
* **downvote due to someone's diet preference**
* **promote or argue ethics and morals** 
* **promote diet absolutism** - no diet is the *only* healthy one.  You CAN say ""this is best for me"" and explain why and what it emphasizes
* **make specious claims** - chronic disease cure claims are not allowed.  Saying it ""can control the symptoms of"" is fine if that is the case
* **engage in pitchforking or brigading** - avoid doing it to this or any other subreddit or the posts therein
* **bias whine** - is not helpful. ""I'm downvoted because I eat (name diet)"" is just shit stirring and trying to play martyr
* **excessively advertise a diet based subreddit** - talk about your favorite diet but only advertise the sub for it in no more than 1/10 of your activity

**2) No personalized nutrition inquiry posts. Instead ask in the comments section of the** **[/r/Nutrition weekly Personal Nutrition Discussion sticky post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/about/sticky?num=2)** - If your post contains *ANY* personal context (it pertains to you, your diet, your family member(s) or anyone within your sphere) and/or a diet evaluation request (something you or someone in your life ate, are eating, or thinking about consuming), *it will be removed*, no exceptions. **Trying to end run this rule, pretending it is unclear, or making any kind of baseless, false, disingenuous, or entitlement based appeals will result in a ban.**

**3) [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) is required** - Avoid flame wars and vote complaining. Trolling, insults, brigading, or antagonism towards the subreddit participants, the moderators, or even the community itself may also result in a ban. Instead of bashing, share sources, citations, and studies, as well as accept when your positions are going to differ. Walk away if something angers you.

**4) No blogspam and/or self-promotion** - Any form of linking, referencing, or mentioning of things you are affiliated with will be removed and likely result in a ban. This applies to your sites, videos, media channels, books, articles, surveys, etc.  The sub is here to talk about nutrition science, not what you've created. Do not try to use the sub to drive traffic to something you are involved with, even if it is free.  IRB approved surveys may be approved if a request is sent to the moderators.

**5) No requesting or providing medical advice** - these problem posts usually involve a disease, a diagnosis, a lab value, and/or discussion you've had with a health professional.  You can ask how nutrition impacts humans in general but you may not ask for advice about treating or managing a medical conditions or how a nutritional choice would impact your specific medial condition (or a family member).  *All medical questions should be directed to a physician, dietitian, or other qualified and licensed health care provider who has access to your personal medical records.* It is dangerous to solicit medical advice on an internet forum. It is also illegal in most cases and against health care codes of ethics for users to provide it to you in this forum.

**6) All links must be direct links** - The reddit site filter removes uses of link shorteners.  Use a direct URL instead. Submissions of links using link tracking services will lead to an instant ban.

**7) No posts from brand new accounts and negative karma accounts** - Brand new accounts may not make new posts in this subreddit.  However, you can comment on other posts while you get to know the site and subreddit. Negative karma accounts cannot post or comment here.

nutrition,"What Are Some Supplements/Foods/Natural Regimens That Have Helped Resolve Your Ailments So Much, You Wish The World Knew","And, I should say, you wish what worked for you - would work for everyone else - sometimes we know that's not the case.

For me, 1 tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar before each meal has staved off acid reflux and indigestion. DGL (deglycyrrhizinated licorice tablets) for after dinner also. 

Even my friend who's a doctor had no idea these could help."

nutrition,Interesting podcast about diet in early humans,"[StarTalk Podcast: Climate and Diet of Early Humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFy6uigyWRw)  
&gt; What were early humans like? What did they eat? What did they do? On this episode of StarTalk Radio, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Matt Kirshen investigate the diet of early humans and the climate conditions of Earth during that time with geochemist Tina L√ºdecke.  
  
&gt; You‚Äôll find out about Tina‚Äôs research studying early humans from 1-4 million years ago. We investigate what happened during the Paleolithic era. How has the environment changed? Tina tells us how isotopes can be used as a ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù to understand the diet of early humans. You‚Äôll learn why there isn‚Äôt just one paleo diet.   
  
&gt; We discuss meat consumption in early humans and how that changed the course of civilization. Were there any condiments used by early humans? Can you ever study fossilized food? Tina explains how we can study fossilized feces and we reminisce about Jurassic Park.   
  
&gt; Then, we answer fan-submitted Cosmic Queries. Can we learn anything from early humans that might help us adapt to climate change in the future? We explore the invention of cooking meat. You‚Äôll find out why the advancements of cooked food helped our brains grow. All that, plus, we ponder what kind of evolutionary changes might occur due to the impact of climate change."
nutrition,good and bad bacteria,"We all heard that certain types of food feed good bacteria (veggies etc) and sugar, for instance, feeds so called bad bacteria. Given that all microbes in our gut live as one big community and often are benefiting each other - how do we humans decide who is bad and who is good? Secondly, Candida (listed as a bad guy) and Lactic acid bacteria both grow well on sugar substrate. Doesn't it mean that by giving them oatmeal with a banana I feed both? I mean how do they decide which bug is going to it what?"
nutrition,What are some ways i can maintain a healthy nutritious diet when my family doesn‚Äôt care about what we eat?,"I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to ask this so i‚Äôm sorry if it isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm 16, and currently don‚Äôt have a source of income (looking for a job). I live with my family who are not the most nutritious people. I‚Äôve tried to get them to change but it is very hard to. My parents are the ones who control what we all eat because they do all the grocery shopping. Like i said before, i can‚Äôt buy my own groceries because i don‚Äôt have a source of income but i plan to soon. Until then, what are some things i can do to encourage them to buy healthier foods? What are some things I can do to maintain a healthy diet for myself?"
nutrition,Vegetarian and Anti-inflammatory diet meal ideas?,"I would appreciate any ideas for snack, food, beverage, and meal ideas for an anti-inflammatory vegetarian diet."
nutrition,There are several advantages to stone-ground wheat flour.,"The endosperm, bran, and germ remain in their natural, original proportions. Because the stones grind slowly, the wheat germ is not exposed to excessive temperatures. Heat causes the fat from the germ portion to oxidize and become rancid and much of the vitamins to be destroyed (Aubert, 1989). Since only a small amount of grain is ground at once, the fat from the germ is well distributed which also minimizes spoilage (Mount, 1975). Nutritive losses due to oxygen exposure are also limited by the fact that stone-ground flour is usually coarser (Thomas, 1976). As expressed in The Bread Book (Leonard, 1990), stone-ground flour is preferred by many bakers and natural food advocates because of its texture, its sweet and nutty flavour, and the beliefs that it is nutritionally superior and has a better baking quality than steel-roller-milled flour. Moritz and Jones (1950) and Schultz et al. (1942) showed that stone-milled flour was relatively high in thiamin, compared to roller-milled flour, especially when from hard wheat.

nutrition,Question about Re-Feeding Syndrome and Water Fasting,"To my very basic understanding of it, in a nutshell, it‚Äôs when your body is malnourished whether it be from an intentional fast or whatever the case may be, you are supposed to slowly re-introduce nourishment or else it can cause a lot of health problems. Makes sense.

I am currently at hour 22 of my quick 24 hour fast I‚Äôm doing. Now I know fasting for 24 hours is light compared to some of the multi-day or even multi-week water fasts people do. 

My question is, how LONG of a fast do you have to part-take in before refeeding syndrome becomes a real issue. From what I can gather online it seems like you don‚Äôt have to be very conscious of it until you are participating in a 72 hour or longer fast. Anything shorter than that you can just resume eating by starting with a small to normal-ish healthy meal and pick up your nutrition where you left it after that. Is this correct?

Im not really worried about it for a quick 24 hour water fast, I‚Äôm more so just curious about the information about it. 

If anyone has any answers lemme know! Thanks."
nutrition,Confusion with fiber,I‚Äôm trying to get 25g of fiber a day through diet and supplements. The supplements I take have 2g of dietary fiber and 2g of soluble fiber per serving. Would I count each serving as 4g or 2g?
nutrition,I accidentally ate the right ratio of sodium to potassium,"Basically, using my new fitbit nutrition tracker, I've discovered that I achieve a ratio of 1 to 3 for my sodium and potassium consumption. And I've done this without even paying any attention to either. I simply just ate what I normally did and ended up eating ~1,300mg sodium and ~3,100mg potassium. I guess this post is here to remind people that nature is amazing and maybe it's easy for the human mind to overthink nutrition when it really is about just eating everything the Earth gives you."
nutrition,Is it true you keep fat if you eat late at night?,But this makes it easier to not eat until noon and be productive the next day!?
nutrition,Is whole wheat flour legitimately a whole grain?,I remember there were some shenanigans that were pulled where they would label everything whole grain but it really wasn't. But is King Author while wheat flour the real deal?
nutrition,"What are the worst things about the premade grocery store nutrition shakes, and what should you eat on top of them to offset their weaknesses?","say you are eating them to quickly get some vitamins and calories

Also, are there more time efficient and cost effective ways to get that variety nutrition easily and cheaply if you are wheelchair bound and have difficulty cooking on your own?"
nutrition,Feeling cold after eating,"For the past month, I've been noticing something strange and that's feeling very cold after having a meal. Like cold to the point where I get goosebumps on my body and this has just started happening in the past month. Should I talk to my doctor about this and does anyone else have this happen?"
nutrition,What is wrong with this subs attitude towards carbs?,"I don‚Äôt understand it. Carbs do not make you fat. The FDA suggests, for a normal diet to get most of your calories through carbs. 

When trying to lose weight, I‚Äôve always, as well as instructed friends and clients, to eat 50% carbs, 35-40% protein and 10-15% fat. It works amazingly! These are also the standard recommended macros they teach you to eat in PT classes, school, websites. It is the fried and true and it works. 

In the fitness community, people do not avoid carbs. I rarely see anyone, whether they‚Äôre bulking or cutting, chose keto or low carb diets. Carbs give you energy, have a higher thermic effect of food, there are less calories per gram than with fat.. there‚Äôs just no reason to avoid them. 

I understand that people who may be extremely over weight use keto, but keto is rarely (not never) used for performance such as weight lifting, body building, sports or athletics. It‚Äôs strictly a weight loss diet that some people find easier to comply with. 

So I‚Äôm confused. Can someone explain to me why you think carbs are the enemy? I mean, I know what works for me and I‚Äôve been doing it since I was 17, but I want to know why it seems to be common in this sub?"
nutrition,"If DHA/EPA is only found in seafood+algae, how have land-locked peoples historically accessed this nutrient?",DHA/EPA seems to be vital for the healthy functioning of the human mind and body.. but so many landlocked populations throughout history have had absolutely no access to seafood. How does this figure? Do humans necessarily need access to seafood to be healthy and obtain these nutrients?
nutrition,Quaker Oats flavored oatmeal...,"Is it better to eat the flavored Quaker Oats oatmeal, with lots of added sugar, or not eat oatmeal at all?"
nutrition,Does oatmeal affect fat absorption?,"I'm talking about soluble fiber, beta-glucan in oats. I know that it can 'bind to bile acids' and make you pass them with stool instead of absorbing them back as it normally should be. That is how oats lower cholesterol - your body has to produce extra bile acids to make up for lost ones, and that requires taking cholesterol from your blood, right?

But does it have any affect on fat absorption/metabolism? Let's say that someone mixes greek yogurt/nut butter/oil into their oatmeal - is their body even able to absorb these lipids?"
nutrition,Green Mix Vs Multivitamins,"In the book ""Own the Day,"" the author suggests replacing your multivitamin with a green mix.  Has anyone done this?  What do you use?  It seems the green mixes I found don't have a ton of vitamins in them.  

In general, I'm also curious about everyones general routine with vitamins and what you all take.  Thanks."
nutrition,How to buy pork that's safest?,"Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but just learned about this thing that they add to pig feed to make pork meat more lean, and apparently it has side effects(ractopamine: ..._is an animal feed additive used to promote leanness and increase food conversion efficiency in livestock in some countries, but banned in others._)

nutrition,If I see one more post making an argument about diet superiority I'm going to scream.,"
The reason for this is you can't call a diet better than another diet because ""better"" is defined differently for every person.

It's almost like spam at this point posts arguing that keto is bad or that plant-based diets are best or that omnivore diets are superior to plant it based diets.

If humans were purely algorithmic we could probably boil this down to an exact science this is what you need to eat when and how frequently. Unfortunately life is shades of gray and what is best for one person might be unsustainable for another person. What might be best for one person might be best for another for a completely different reason.

Associating with a diet type is reductive thinkingand it's sad to see the discourse on such a great sub reduced to frequent banter where neither side is willing to concede or even have an open mind."

nutrition,Probiotics sourced from food vs supplements during course of penicillin?,"What‚Äôs up fine folks,

I have recently developed a severely enlarged tonsil and my doc has prescribed some penicillin to see if that might help relieve it - I personally don‚Äôt think it will but it‚Äôs painful so I‚Äôll give it a go. I despise taking antibiotics as I know how damaging they can be to the little guys in our gut.

My question to you guys is: to repopulate my gut bacteria both during and post the course of antibiotics, should I choose a probiotic supplement or choose to use kefir and sauerkraut instead? I‚Äôm strapped for cash at the moment and would like to only choose one or the other. What‚Äôs the safest bet in your opinion?

Prebiotics wise I‚Äôm safe, I consume 3 fruits, 5 veg and 3 grains, a portion of chia seeds, a portion of walnuts and a portion of raw cacao each day so my fibre intake is cushty! I will be taking psyllium husk too :)

Thanks !! Happy New Year !!"
nutrition,Fish oil supplementing,"Hi, I'm looking to balance out my omega 3 and 6 ratio, I've been looking around on amazon for a trusted fish oil but I keep finding people saying the products are bad. I know BioTRUST has supposedly trusted supplements, but they are also very expensive.  


Can anyone recommend me where to buy fish oil? preferably Krill Oil, as I am looking to get more DHA not EPA. Thanks"
nutrition,Calorie counting,"Hello everyone, I have been obsessively counting my calories for a while now and I've always had this problem. How do you find out how many there are in home cooked foods? I know there are many calculators on the web but one of them rendered my chickpeas soup (just the beans and water with spices) to 390 per 100 grams, and I think thats way too much. 

How do you keep track of the calories in home cooked meals?"
nutrition,Exact foods and nutrients to boost immunity and headaches? Is Vitamin-C powder enough?,"Hi guys, so I‚Äôm having a weird odd cold/drowsy feeling. I am coughing, but minimal and I can still taste and smell. However I‚Äôve had the longest consecutive headache the past two days; making me fatigue and eyes hurt when looking at a screen. I hope it‚Äôs only a stress headache. My body is sometimes warm as well, but not hot as a serious fever and not as cold to where it‚Äôs too concerning. I WILL get tested though just in case‚Äî in the meantime, what are some foods and nutrients I can take to enhance my immunity and  especially to ease my head? So far I drank some Vitamin C powder yesterday after breakfast"
nutrition,Young people eating unhealthily and justifying by being slim,"I‚Äòm 27 and care a lot about nutrition. I want to be a team with my body and give it what it needs. So lately, I‚Äôve been reading about the essential 47 nutrients that the body needs and can‚Äôt get elsewhere. I have been eating, or rather drinking as a smoothie, much more veggies as a result, as they provide a lot of those nutrients with few calories. 

Yet then I see people my age who almost feel ‚Äûcool‚Äú about only eating sparsely and then even junkfood all day, and justify it by pointing out that they still look slim and fit. Don‚Äôt they make the mistake of only focusing on calories/energy, which are way less important than those essential daily nutrients? I mean, a young body can put up with that lack of nutrients for a while, but it will have long term effects later when older. Or am I overthinking this?"
nutrition,How does straining affect nut milk's nutritional content?,"So I just recently started using a nut milk bag to make my own pumpkin seed milk. I noticed that a lot of stuff was left in the bag after straining. Obviously straining removes the fibre, but I was wondering what other nutrients might be taken out by the straining process?"
nutrition,FAST FOOD NUTRITION DATA,Hey guys!! I was wondering if there are any credible databases out there that have updated fast food nutrition information readily available to the public (other than going to the direct website).
nutrition,Migraine free since starting low carb. Why?,"Cut out all sugar, flours, grains, rices, potatoes, starches etc. Still get some carbs from fruit, veggies, and dairy but not a ton. 

And by migraines I mean like full on aura so bad I can't see or read, terrible pain, vomiting for four hours. Been to a doctor and have had a steady triptan prescription since the age of 12 and got them pretty frequently.

Reason why I started the low carb diet was to handle some gut dysbiosis/fungal issues I've been having. (It's working for that too). This migraine thing is just a perk. And yes I consulted a doctor before cutting carbs. 

I wouldn't say I'm ""cured"". I'll say that once it's been a year but four months is pretty big for me and much better than the alternative. Longest it's been in 8 years. 

I can't find a lot of good studies on sugar/carb restriction and chronic migraines. Anyone know any possible mechanisms? Oxidative stress? Gut biome imbalance? Over all allergy to refined sugars? Is that a thing? 

Would love to see any relevant studies or anecdotal experience. Thanks :)"

This might be a stupid question, but I‚Äôve had severe constipation and the doctor recommended castor oil (2-4 TBSP due to how extreme my case is) but I‚Äôm also on a really strict diet and have no clue what to log.

nutrition,(Very serious) Granola bars food poisoning or upset stomach?,"Today I ate about 10 granola bars
I bought this 20 bar pack and ate half of it because they tasted good

I've got extremely unwell, vomited 3 times. Intense stomach cramps and heavy headache, mild sweating.

I also drank 3x500ml bottle of water total and vomited that on top as well

I thought granola bars were supposed to be a healthy thing...

Could I have eaten too many of them?

Could this be because I didn't eat anything else and the granola bars were too strong on my stomach or could the granola bars have been infected with something?

I'm feeling a bit better now, have a small headache

Has anyone experienced something similar with granola bars?"
nutrition,In-Season Blackberries,"So forgive me if this is a dumb question. Are the blackberries at the grocery stores in Southern Ontario at this time of year are in season?

I don't know much about this subject at all, but I assume they would have to be coming from somewhere else to be in season right now. So I guess I should be looking for specific regions at specific times?

nutrition,"If you eat, let's say, 1 large apple in the morning, and you're satisfied, are you supposed to stop eating, even though the meal wasn't calorically dense?","We know that fruits and vegetables are nutritious, but many (not all) of them aren't rich in calories. So although you might feel full after a large fruit or vegetable, you probably didn't take in many calories.

If a person were to, let's say, only eat a large apple for breakfast, a huge avocado for lunch, and a large sweet potato for supper, and feel full after each meal, sure they'd get various vitamins, but not many calories throughout the day. I'm not saying to do this every day, as that might eventually lead to malnutrition, however if the average human eats a large piece of produce for a meal, and then feels satisfied, should they simply stop eating?

If one lets say eats a large burrito, full of calories, and feels full, to then also eat a piece of cake would be overeating.

But if one eats a large apple, which doesn't have many calories, and then feels full, is eating more after that considered overeating?

There's probably no clear cut right/wrong answer here. In general, they say to listen to what your body tells you.

But I'm just curious about the question."

nutrition,Collagen peptide supplements - plenty of anecdotal success stories but my basic understanding of the science implies that it wont work,"

I did a bit of research and there are plenty of people online swearing that it works, that they had very noticeable results on skin quality and even joint-pain relief 


But then again, collagen is a protein. And the protein will be broken down into amino acids, will it not? So surely the body cannot react differently to this than to any other dietary protein?? I saw one seller of collagen supplements referring to it as bioavailable which would be misleading if the collagen were broken down.

nutrition,The ethics of prospective dietary studies,"This idea that dietary studies are unethical is one of the best smokescreens the food and agricultural industries have put out there -- complete misinformation and propaganda.

If we objectively knew that something was the best treatment -- like antibiotics for an infection or setting a broken bone -- then yes, to do something that we were sure was less effective would be unethical.

But we really have no idea with diet. Keto, Paleo, Atkins, Vegan, Carnivore, Fruitarian, any one of these could be the best. In scenarios of uncertainty, the only way forward is prospective randomized double blinded multi center trials. Otherwise you're stuck with *a priori* reasoning (first principles) and analogy. Inductive reasoning. A really pathetic and ineffective way to develop theories. That's were superstition and religious fundamentalism is born. That's why it's such a cluster f to try and debate approaches.

That's how we figured out retroviral combinations for AIDS or chemotherapy combinations for cancer. We didn't just refuse to experiment because we had a treatment that ""kind of"" worked. And as it stands, current dietary recommendations ""kind of"" don't work at all.

The ethics argument is meant to obscure the real reason these studies haven't been done: *the food and agricultural industries.* Their lobbies and capital influence are massive, and they strongly pressure the NIH **to not award grants to research that suggests their food is bad for you**. This goes for both sides of the camp -- the dairy, egg, agricultural, meat industries. Got Milk, Beef it's What's for Dinner, etc. If you had a multibillion dollar industry and you were a producer, wouldn't you pool with your competitors to fund a commercial campaign and lobby? Why wouldn't you? In the capitalistic system, the goal is to win.

All of them do the same dirty crap. They learned from the best -- Big Tobacco did this to devastating effect for most of the 20th century. Big Food is filled with the same jerks. *It is impossible to convince a man of a fact if his pocketbook depends on him believing the opposite.*

As an example of a food science belief that I have: I don't think the genetic sugar filled mutants that we call fruit are good for almost anyone other than those who have issues metabolizing fat (PEMT variants not taking choline etc.) But this is *inductive reasoning* based on a handful of patients that were willing to get genetic testing and carefully track their diets -- even then when you have a specific genetic make up, it doesn't mean your genes are necessarily ""turned on"". *We know so, so little without randomized prospective studies*.

I remember trying to get nutritional research funded for fatty liver where patients would monitor their dietary intake with an app; even then journal editors and my lab director just laughed in my face when I submitted research proposals.

""Interesting idea. Who's gonna pay for this?"" with a knowing smirk. No one would.

""Sure if you'll work for free.""

It takes about a billion dollars to bring a drug from bench to bedside when you tally up the labs, research and trial costs. Roughly a few hundred million dollars to do an effective diet study on a large scale (you would save a portion of the benchside fees).

The thing we know definitively works for longevity and general health in the average person is caloric restriction, for which intermittent fasting seems to be the most effective approach (for most) psychologically. Keto foods work as an appetite suppressant, so I suspect a lot of their effect is just by reducing the total amount you eat. It also seems that the nutrients found in unprocessed animal foods are closer in structure to those we use in our own bodies.

There are very few proven axioms in nutrition. The field is literally almost entirely handwaving and ulterior motives.

Please feel free to pick this post apart. I would sincerely appreciate a reasoned discussion and any scientific studies. I am always trying to eat crow and learn more."

nutrition,Acid Fluid Whey Nutrition Facts,"Hey guys, i know it sounds crazy but i was wondering that does acid liquid whey (the water left after regular yogurt strained to make greek yogurt) have always the same calories and nutritional values no matter what the regular yogurt's nutritional values are. I mean , when you strain full fat regular yoghurt or low fat regular yoghurt , the leftover whey have the same calories and macros per 100g let's say? When i search for nutritional Info for acid whey it says 24 calories per 100g everywhere on the internet.
The reason why i wonder this there is'nt any brand selling light(low or non fat)strained yogurt in my country. So I buy regular light yogurt and strain it myself and want to make sure about the calories of the strained light yogurt that i make."
nutrition,Should you moderate fruit consumption because of the sugar or can you eat however much?,"I was under the impression sugar is harmful and should be cut down as much as possible, but after I asked about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/jjapyl/is_sugar_not_harmful/), the conclusion seemed to be that sugar is not inherently harmful, but only in so far as it is high in calories and can displace other, more nutritious foods.

So, given that, can you eat however much fruit you want with no regard to the sugar content, since sugar is not inherently harmful, or is there still some reason for moderation?

For example, grapefruit is high in sugar (16g) - can I have two or even three grapefruits after breakfast and lunch or is there some problem with that?"

nutrition,Does oatmeal (FIBER) affect fat absorption?," I'm talking about soluble fiber, beta-glucan in oats. I know that it can 'bind to bile acids' and make you pass them with stool instead of absorbing them back as it normally should be. That is how oats lower cholesterol - your body has to produce extra bile acids to make up for lost ones, and that requires taking cholesterol from your blood, right?

But does it have any affect on fat absorption/metabolism? Let's say that someone mixes greek yogurt/nut butter/oil into their oatmeal - is their body even able to absorb these lipids?"

nutrition,Optimal Production of Enzymes in the Body,"There are lots of different enzymes in the body which are involved in the synthesis of many hormones in the body and are involved in thousands of other reactions. Examples include P450scc,  3Œ≤-HSD, 5Œ±-Reductase and many others.

How does nutrition impact the production of these enzymes?  As I understand it enzymes are made from amino acids so getting a variety of different types of proteins is important to ensure that the body has access to amino acids that it can't produce by itself. 

Is there anything else that is important to the production of these enzymes such as minerals or fats? How should someone adjust their diet to optimise their health?"

nutrition,Unpopular opinion: Sub 1kcal days (weeks even) feel amazing.,"I've seen the sentiment mentioned a million times throughout Reddit: You should NOT consistently eat less than 1,000 calories in a day. I've seen people speak of feeling fatigued, ill, weak, etc.

I've done this consistently on/off for months. A big part of what makes it feasible are protein powders because they're so low in calories but still let you easily hit protein goals. Some of my highest energy days are the low calories ones, going down to 500-600 even. 12 hours later after waking up and going through the work day, I've still had it in me do work on strength training after finally getting home. 

I strongly get the impression that people are doing it completely wrong and probably aren't aware that many popular food choices such as fruits/oatmeal are in fact low in protein. A couple eggs / whey scoops later, I'm good for practically the entire day. I have incredibly prominent abs and attribute heavy calorie deficit periods to excellent progress in fat loss while still being able to maintain strength.

Whenever I tried vegetarian options, either at restaurants or to make at home, I seem to mostly find pretentious lists of ingredients and rather bad-tasting overall results. I always worry as well that I won't get all the nutrients, vitamins and minerals I need, as I have no idea how to replace the protein and fat in meat.
If you can recommend some good free resources or directly your vegetarian meal plans, I'd be very grateful!"
nutrition,Go with the Flow: Improve Circulation," 

Occasionally, everyone experiences ‚Äúpins and needles‚Äù where an arm or foot ‚Äúfall asleep.‚Äù Often the result of poor positioning, the sensation occurs when blood to the area is interrupted. The discomfort subsides after vigorous rubbing or shaking of the extremity to restore blood circulation. These isolated incidents are not typically a cause for concern. However, poor circulation might be.

*Circulation Information*

Blood circulation transports nutrients throughout the body, helps manage waste production, improves muscle recovery after a workout, and accelerates healing. Healthy circulation maximizes these functions by improving blood flow via vessels, arteries, veins, and capillaries. When circulation is compromised by disease or other factors, muscles easily atrophy and numbness and tingling frequently occur. Infections develop more easily. Poor circulation increases risk for serious health threats, including stroke, hypertension, and kidney failure. In extreme cases, death can result.

*Help Your Heart*

Vigorous blood flow eases the heart‚Äôs function. The simple analogy of a sink with a clogged drain demonstrates the additional effort required to force blood through the body when circulation is poor. Clear passageways with oxygenated blood pulse through the body with less exertion. Hence, the term ‚Äúrunner‚Äôs pulse.‚Äù Note the optimal standard isn‚Äôt called the ‚Äúcouch-potato‚Äôs pulse.‚Äù Although that sounds relaxing, appearances can be misleading. When done continuously as a lifestyle, your insides must compensate for the lounging around by working harde"

nutrition,"So Beyond Meat ""beef"" patties aren't healthy. But are they HEALTHIER than beef?","I see a ton of posts about people asking about whether plant-based meats are healthy, but one quick look at the nutrition label proves otherwise.

That said, I'm one of the few people who thinks Beyond Meat beef patties taste pretty darn close to the real thing (especially how I look to cook them/make the burger). So my question is more about the relativity - I already am an advocate for animal rights, but ignoring that: is Beyond Meat healthIER than beef? If I was going to cook up/go out for a traditional burger would a plant-based solution be better?"

nutrition,Do high-carbohydrate diets increase satiety? Why or why not?,"I read some relevant articles and it seems that there is no clear answer because not enough studies have been done, and because of the diverse subtypes of carbohydrates and several complicated factors that can determine appetite (which itself isn't easily measured). 

One particular article from 2001 was quite comprehensive on this: [Carbohydrates, Appetite and Feeding Behavior in Humans](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/131/10/2775S/4686468#111891761)

&gt;The effects on appetite and energy balance of the vast range of specific carbohydrate subtypes are almost unknown at this level. Some carbohydrates may constrain intake because they limit digestibility of foods (35). They may not elevate satiety, which adds further to the heterogeneity of feeding and motivational responses.  
&gt;  
&gt;As has been discussed throughout this article, numerous confounding effects need to be controlled when comparing the effects of different carbohydrates on appetite, feeding behavior and energy balance. These effects include the energy density of foods; presence of other nutrients in foods; moisture content of foods being compared; sensory attributes of foods; and psychological, physiological and genetic predisposition of the subjects being studied

And also,

&gt;The general perception that all carbohydrates are protective against weight gain seems to be far less secure than was generally supposed in the past decade. There is clearer evidence now that some carbohydrates can elevate energy intake by both nutritional and sensory mechanisms. 

I would really appreciate some clarification as to whether or not there is a general effect of the quantity of carbs in one's diet on appetite? 

It's important to me because it's part of a chemistry course I am undertaking, which states that a high-carb/low-fat diet generally results in less accumulation of body fat than a low-carb/high-fat diet (IK that the amount of fat may have independent effects on satiety) and that high-carb diet generally aids in satiety.

Any insights are really appreciated."
nutrition,Best Ways To Get Normal Vitamin D Levels,What are the best ways to get your Vitamin D up to normal levels?
nutrition,What is the biological mechanism that causes the reduction in the TEF whilst in a deficit?,"Hi there, 

I've read about the body's natural response mechanisms to a caloric deficit via reduction in metabolism through reduced NEAT and BMR- these both make sense mechanically, NEAT because you have less energy available 'ambiently' and BMR because you just have less mass in general. What makes less sense to me is how the body reduces the TEF whilst in a deficit, as far as I'm aware TEF is directly related to the energy required to digest each macronutrient, so how does the body adjust to use less energy to breakdown the same macronutrient ( i.e becomes more efficient at digestion, right?). 

In a similar vein, we know the TEF of protein, for example, is anywhere from 25-35%, what kind of % reduction are we looking at whilst in a deficit? Is it substantial or would it be minor?

The only logical conclusion that I could come across is that I may have not been receiving a lot of sun exposure due to wearing long sleeves. I actually do spend time outside so I get to *see* the sun and my rhytm of going to sleep and waking up is pretty regular, it's just that my sleep is not good, I don't feel rested and I wake up a lot. Could this be due to Vitamin D and has this actually happened to anyone? Is this the right subreddit for this question, since it doesn't actually deal with nutritional aspect of vitamins?"

nutrition,Sodium's effects on health are contradictory,"Sodium is an essential mineral of the human body and the major cation of the extracellular fluid. It regulates fluid balance, blood pressure, and cellular homeostasis by regulating plasma volume and cellular transport.

Sodium serves many physiological functions and is necessary for health. Humans can obtain sufficient sodium from the low amounts present in many foods, including fresh meat, fish, and vegetables, but most of the sodium we now consume is added in food processing or at the table.

Sodium chloride (NaCl) or salt has also been used as a preservative for centuries and is now added for flavoring during food preparation. Salt is an excellent preservative because it reduces the water activity of foods, which is the amount of unbound water available for microbial growth and chemical reactions.

Salt can also alter the texture of meats, such as in brining, which can produce a juicier product, while increasing the taste and palatability of the food. The mean body content of sodium in the adult male is 92 gr., with half of this (46 gr.) being located in the extracellular fluid, 11 gr. being found in the intracellular fluid, and 35 gr. being found in the skeleton.

The concentration gradient between the extracellular and intracellular fluid is maintained by the activity of the sodium-potassium (Na+/K+) pump. The sodium-potassium (Na+/K+) pump, found ubiquitously in all animal cells, transfers sodium and potassium, respectively, from inside to outside the cell, and vice versa, against the concentration gradient, using the energy supplied by ATP (adenosine triphosphate).

In the polarized cells of the renal tubular epithelium or the intestinal wall, sodium enters the cell from the tubular lumen or from the gut, through specific channels and other transport mechanisms. Afterward, it is extruded from the cell into the adjacent capillaries, again, through the action of the sodium-potassium (Na+/K+) pump, which is mainly distributed on the basolateral sides of the cell.

In these types of epithelial cells, sodium transport is mostly facilitated along with other substrates, such as phosphates, amino acids, glucose, and galactose.

nutrition,Hypothetical Replicator raw ingredients,"I was just thinking about the Replicator from Star Trek, the fantastic machine that can produce ANY food or beverage, and a real-life more reasonable and realistic counterpart, a sort of food 3d printer.  


Then I wondered, how few raw ingredients could you actually get away with using to produce ANY flavor of food, in the same way your computer only uses red green and blue to create all the colors of the rainbow. This would be ignoring structural or texture aspects, and I guess it would all come in some sort of extruded gel form, and of course that would 'ruin' the flavor in that way.  


My first guess would be something like ""fat, salt, sugar, something bitter, and proteins"", assuming water is part of every ingredient for extrusion purposes. Is this at all accurate? Could you get away with even fewer? How many ingredients would be needed for this hypothetical machine to replicate pretty much any flavor?"

For a hypothetical example, person A and person B have IDENTICAL diets, lives, and chemical/DNA composition, etc. Their diets would be decently well-rounded, but nothing spectacular. Sufficient macro and micronutrient intake. 100% identical, except for ~1/4 of their calorie intake


Person A:
- 200 calories of swiss chard, bok choy, cabbage, collard greens, mushrooms
- 300 calories ultra processed pastries, soda, candy, etc.

Person B: (never touches candy or soda, but almost never eats vegetables, especially leafy greens. if they aren't nutrient deficient is the lack of vegetables still concerning?)
- 500 calories potatoes, rice, corn (person A also eats these, just not quite as much)

* Probiotics should be kept refrigerated regardless of what is on the bottle for preservation.

nutrition,I feel nauseous a few hours after having Soda.,"At the beginning of the year, I chose to stop drinking soda, and was actually successful for a very long time. Eventually, I fell back into my old habits, but less than before (maybe one 12oz can instead of 2), I would say that was about 6 months or so after the new year.

Usually I drink Diet Coke, because that is what my parents always have around the house since I was young. I have no issues when drinking Diet Coke, outside of the sugar rush/caffeine and sugar crash that are normal. But as I became more lax, I started to drink  20oz Coke bottles on my sunday trip to the market. Recently, if I drink Coke, be it the bottle size or something like a medium drink from fast food, I start to feel nauseous after a few hours, not just the usual sugar rush/crash.

Now this feeling always dissipates after 15 minutes or so, but it seems odd that only classic coke seems to affect me this poorly (I used to always drink coke vanilla, but I am unsure how it affects me now).

I do not have diabetes, as far as I know I am a healthy and young, and I do light cardio every other day or so. I am also well aware of how nutritionally bankrupt soda is, it became a delicacy that returned to being a habit.

I have however, had norovirus recently, just after thanksgiving, and I recall that something like this happened when I first got norovirus a year ago.

Even though everyone one weighs the same on a scale there is no way all these different physiques will have the same body composition; some will have more muscle, some will have more fat, some with higher bone density, some with less, etc. So is it actually necessary for people to follow the general rule of .8-1g of protein per lb of body weight or is there a better way you can approach this if you have access to data from a BMI scan?

Let's say your maintenance cal is 3000 and you go keto for 30 days and become completely carb depleted, meaning your glycogen stores are all zeroed out. Then on day 31, you decide to cheat with carbs, so you eat 3000 calories (which is your maintenance) of mostly carbs and then also eat 2000 extra. So your total for that day is 5000. 

You would expect to gain around 2000/3500 extra lbs of fat (neglecting the added food thermic effect and other variables), but Greg doucette says that those extra 2000 would actually be stored in your glycogen. I think this assumes the body can store about 500g of glycogen. Meaning you can eat 5000 can not gain any form of fat!

 Now first, is this true or no?

Second, if it is true, I thought it was calories in calories out, so that extra 2k calories would be stored as fat, but if they are not and instead are stored as glycogen, why is that? Does this also explain why Greg might be carbing up on 5000+ calories before his show day?"

The article says ""... researchers have found that people who regularly consume fake sweeteners have a dramatically increased risk of [metabolic syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17646581).""  The article goes on to say, ""Basically, the more super sweet tasting sodas a person drinks (even if the sweetness is not coming from real sugar), the more they crave that same taste again. This can lead to overeating high calorie, [high carb foods](https://diabetesmealplans.com/5632/top-10-diabetic-foods-to-avoid/), which increase your [blood sugar levels](https://diabetesmealplans.com/5080/diabetes-blood-sugar-levels-chart-printable) and may result in gaining even more weight.""

Here's what I'm not sure about.  If this article is true, is the metabolic syndrome brought on by the mere presence of the artificial sweeteners found in a can of Coke Zero (and the body's reaction to those sweeteners) or is it brought on as a result of eating high calorie and high carb foods which the article claims result from consuming those sweeteners?  If one consumes one or two cans a week but otherwise follows a fairly strict low GI diet, is one still in danger of developing this metabolic syndrome?  Thanks!"

nutrition,Ode to Winter Squash,"Oh, winter squash! How do I love thee? Let me count the ways...

You have such grand fiber, vitamins and minerals galore!

Your calories defy your nutritional profile and lovely taste and texture- you could make a sweet potato blush.

So sweet and versatile- you can be a hearty soup, roasted and mashed with a little almond milk, dressed up with nuts and a touch of butter or olive oil, made ""spaghetti"", or even dessert! You are just that sweet.

Your secret is also that you are so easy to make right-  cut in half, remove the seeds, face down on foil in a 350 oven for a bit over and hour and... scoop! The rest is destiny. Will you remain pure and perfect as you are, eaten straight out of the oven? Or will you transform into one of your many happy recipes? 

Your varieties are delightful, my little butternut. My pleasing pumpkin. My always-true acorn. My newest love, kabocha. My tease spaghetti. I could go on (and on). The shapes are so pleasing and whole, your flesh colors are bright and rich; a perfect creamy orange, or a zingy and perfectly ""stringy""   
 yellow. 

And, my darling, you are inexpensive and have a fantastic shelf life. It is not often you sit on the counter for long, but if you do, when I pick you up you are ready. A couple of dollars and you will grace my lunches for a work week, as you keep cooked in the fridge like a dream. 

I am sad for you, my sweet. Not everyone knows of your bounty. But I will sing your praises to the end!"

nutrition,Are there any (reliable) studies that show little or no correlation between high carb diets and heart disease?,"I tend to follow a low-carb diet, do some intermittent fasting, the occasional long(ish) fast (2-4 days) etc. I do think that high carb diets are clearly a bad idea for many people, especially those suffering from ""energy toxicity"" diseases such as diabetes, fatty liver disease, obesity. Although I also think this might be multi-factorial - possible damage to the microbiome by sugar-loving pathogens which may also like starch, energy toxicity, inertia, nutritional deficiencies etc. 

I am by no means pro or anti carbs - I do enjoy some parsnips, potatoes, rice, oats and corn, I just don't go overboard with it.

So I just ask if anyone knows of any studies that show long-term high-carb diets with little evidence of heart disease in the person? Thanks."

nutrition,Should one bulk with surplus calories coming from fats or carbohydrates? What about blood sugar spikes?,"[https://renaissanceperiodization.com/case-high-carb-massing/](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/case-high-carb-massing/)

Hello, I have a question about this article concerning the ""surplus fats"" approach versus the ""high-carb/low-fat"" approach. I am trying to decide which approach is best for maximizing muscle gain while minimizing fat loss on a bulk. I am also considering the repercussions of each approach on overall health and cognitive function.

&amp;#x200B;

The article is very interesting and I encourage you to read it for more context to my question, but here are the approaches in a nutshell:

High-carb/low-fat approach: eating adequate amounts of protein and fat with the rest of your calories (including the caloric surplus) coming from carbohydrates.

Surplus fats approach: eating adequate amounts of protein and carbohydrates (adequate meaning enough to refill glycogen stores) with the rest of your calories (including the caloric surplus) coming from fats.

The article also lists a low-carb/high-fat approach, which I am not considering.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my question:

On the ""HCLF"" diet, should one be worried about the negative affects on blood sugar levels associated with consuming so many carbs (often 500+ grams)? It seems like constantly spiking your blood sugar would not be healthy as it is associated with an increased risk of diabetes. On the other hand, with the ""surplus fats"" diet, I am thinking that including more fats will help reduce these blood sugar spikes by slowing digestion. I am also thinking this will bring cognitive benefits, because one will not be experiencing the side effects of constant, drastic rises and falls in blood sugar.

Is this concern even relevant for non-diabetic athletes who constantly utilize glycogen in their workouts? Will their increased insulin sensitivity plus depleted glycogen stores naturally reduce these blood sugar spikes? Even with 500+ grams of carbohydrates?

Thank you for your time and consideration!"

Heres some of the claims about these Lectins according tot he author of this diet and book.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***ALL THIS INFO IS DIRECTLY FROM HE WEBSITE***

""We know this because of a factor called **lectins.** Lectins, abundant and diverse proteins found in foods, have agglutinating properties that affect your blood and the lining of your digestive tract. Lectins are a powerful way for organisms in nature to attach themselves to other organisms in nature.

&amp;#x200B;

So, too, with the lectins in food. Simply put, when you eat a food containing protein lectins that are incompatible with your blood type antigen, the lectins target an organ or bodily system (kidneys, liver, gut, stomach, etc.) and can begin to interact with the tissues in that area.

Here's an example of how a lectin agglutinates in the body. Let's say a Type A person eats a plate of lima beans. The lima beans are digested in the stomach through the process of acid hydrolysis. However, the lectin protein is resistant to acid hydrolysis. It doesn't get digested, but it stays intact. It may interact directly with the lining of the stomach or intestinal tract, or it may get absorbed into your blood stream along with the digested lima bean nutrients. Different lectins target different organs and body systems."""

nutrition,"Increasing Calories, but Still in Deficit?","Hi all! Quick question based on an experience I had recently. 

I had a macro consultation with an RD because I‚Äôd like to become more lean/toned/fit ‚Äî whatever you‚Äôd like to call it ‚Äî and I wasn‚Äôt seeing results from my current eating/workout routine. 

As a 5‚Äô 6‚Äù, 140-145lbs. F, I was recommended to eat at  just over 1800 calories and to work on a structured progressive overload program. Up until this point, I ate around 1500-1600 calories a day, with a mix of 45 min HIIT/LISS workouts 5 days/week.

My question here is two-fold: 

1) Is that kind of increase (despite typically being considered a deficit for someone of my size/activity level) going to cause weight gain? I feel like I get mindfucked with metabolism stuff haha. 

2) Is there a point where I should be concerned whether I‚Äôm gaining weight appropriately (ex. fat vs. muscle, or if I‚Äôm somehow gaining too much (or what would too much be??))?

I am a cyclist who tracks calorie burn using the kilojoule readings from by the power meter I have on my bike. With this info I feel like I have a good idea of how many calories I burn generally.

On days when I go on long rides I may burn upwards of 6,000 calories but even though I may create a deficit of 500-600 calories I often gain a significant amount of weight the day after. I know a good amount of this could be from water retention but it will often take 3-4 days just to return to the weight I was before the long ride.

So I'm wondering if there is just a maximum amount of calories the body can process regardless of calorie deficit, and if so how to find that number?"

Arsenic has different chemical properties, though, and is perhaps more related to the biologically active chemical element phosphorus. so could phosphorus maybe have a role similar to how raised calcium traffic through the body can maybe help to carry away lead with it? (and maybe another similar mechanism, this, or whatever other, might also have some function in also flushing out the likewise-to-arsenic 3+ ionic oxidation state assuming biologically unnecessary waste- chemical-element aluminum?)\* (And also maybe there are some good arsenic chellants, too, like for instance i have heard that there are some compound(s) that help remove it, found in spinach?)

nutrition,"Seriously, how many calories are in Pinto Beans?","I noticed that the nutrition facts (calories specifically) on dried pinto beans seem to vary wildly between brands. So I made a spreadsheet of 10 brands of dried pinto beans with their serving size, calories per serving, and calories per 100 grams. All of the nutrition information is straight off the back of the bag for dried beans.

Casserole claims that their pinto beans are 167 calories per 100 grams, while Goya and Iberia claim that 100 grams of their pinto beans are a whopping 341 calories per 100 grams - more than double that of Casserole! Additionally, only Goya and Iberia have the same calories per serving as one another, while all of the other 8 brands are different from one another and fall somewhere along the spectrum of 167-341 calories per 100 grams.

These are all dried pinto beans. All of the brands list 1/4 cup as the serving size, but one brand says 49 grams is 1/4 cup, another brand claims a paltry 28 grams is 1/4 a cup. Again, all of the serving sizes in grams from the other brands fall somewhere in that spectrum. I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup and filled it with dried pinto beans (locally grown beans, no brand) and it weighed 45 grams. 28 grams barely filled the measuring cup halfway. 

I wouldn't be so confused if the calories were a little bit off, but when some brands are literally DOUBLE the calories for the same serving size, I have to wonder what is really going on.

Any insight?"

I would love to cook for her/do some light exercise, but how do I encourage her to join me and make it fun? I have some really good recipes to try, but she's used to Americana, casserole, noodle dishes. I'm not buying anything processed but there's already some there, so her options are 1. eat processed foods by herself until she runs out 2. eat my foods, or at least a combination of 1 and 2. She is also a proponent of intuitive eating (very anti-diet, she won't really listen to ""health"" talk even when framed well and out of concern, not contempt), which has caused her to overeat greatly the past few months. This makes it hard for her to find the motivation to exercise, too.

I just don't want to be pushy because I've also struggled with weight/health, but she needs the push - at this point, it's unlikely she'll find the discipline on her own. And I just want to help her get back to her old self, have the energy to enjoy things like she used to. What can I say/do to help her? TIA! :)"

More than that and i usually don't have to worry until the next meal, meaning that, even if i feel like going, i can control it pretty easily and even make the need to go away after a while, if the time isn't appropriate.  I started to notice this because there were a handful of occasions where i really had to go in very inappropriate moments and that made me a little paranoid. I really hate peublic bathrooms, or even any bathroom that's not mine, so now i have most of my meals in a timeframe where i know i will be home in the next 4 hours, so if i really feel i can't control it, i don't have to deal with an uncomfortable situation.

nutrition,A rant: Frustrated and Upset,"I just watched a short segment detailing the obesity epidemic in Samoa and it‚Äôs left me angry and upset. The footage showed beautiful tropical scenery, rich with local produce and nutritious foods yet an overwhelming percent of the population is overweight or obese (almost 90% i think). 

While traditional Samoan diets are quite healthy, with tropical produce like bananas, coconuts and meat from seafood, the modern Samoan diet is very different. They drink a lot of sugary sodas, candy etc but the real culprit seems to be fatty meats that are imported from other western countries. One particular favored meat is turkey tails..or the extremely fatty oil producing gland of turkeys that comes in from America. If it isn‚Äôt enough that Americans have hurt the world in so many ways, now we are also exporting our obesity to less developed countries. In the video they show Samoans as young as 28 with diabetes..many people who‚Äôve had to get their feet amputated as a result. It‚Äôs infuriating and sad at the same time. 

While Samoa is an extreme case of obesity unchecked, the rest of the world isn‚Äôt immune to this issue either. It hurts me to think that most of this is due to uneducated public. I was fortunate enough to have been raised by a mom who taught me the basics of nutrition at a young age. But lots of other kids aren‚Äôt as lucky. We can solve this through education and public health policy. But I‚Äôm banking on education because I don‚Äôt trust our politicians too much.

nutrition,"Only non-carb vegetable intake from high pressure pasteurized cold pressed store bought ""greens/reds"" drinks?","I do not eat vegtables outside of potatos for the most part. Assume you have no desire/appetite/taste  whatsoever to consume things like beets or spinach or kale etc. Though you do find store bought red/green juice with good ingredients mostly all vegetable, no added sugar, low sugar etc - palatable. 

Is consuming a good quality ""green drink"" accepted vegetable intake replacement when your current vegetable intake is zero and will stay that way as you have no desire to consume vegetables because they are very bad tasting to you? 

Also, fresh juicing would of course be better, but I have found that to be extremely time consuming and not that much more cost efficient when you factor in the time and energy required to juice a fresh 16oz glass of juice every morning when you can buy a fairly good quality cold pressed vegetable juice for $4 US and just drink one every day instead."

nutrition,Would this be helpful for you?," 

Hi All,

I have gone through cycles of dieting and tracking food with apps like myfitnesspal and I always had an issue with never really knowing how to estimate the weight of the meat I was about to eat so I could count the calories and track it in the app.

There is always the option to use a food scale but I often didn't have access to one (eating out, eating at college cafeteria, etc.).

Would you use an app that can estimate the weight of the meat you are eating? The app would be simple, take a picture of the food(chicken for example) and the app would then estimate the weight of the chicken, say 5oz for example. Then, you would be able to put the 5oz of chicken in your meal tracking app for a more accurate tracking option than just guessing.

Is this something that you would use? If not, I will not waste my time trying to create it lol. A simple yes or no would suffice but feedback on this idea would be well appreciated!"

nutrition,Does eating in huge bowls/mixing food works against proper nutrition?,"Due to a complete lack of appetite and sense of taste, im usually a slow eater: i take 1 to 2 hours to have dinner (even though i've been trying to reduce time); meanwhile, i tend to mix different kinds of food from the plates i've preparared. 

For example, i'll take some pieces of a sweet red bell pepper and throw it in a quinoa and corn mix; take some mushrooms and throw them in my rice along with other veggies ecc; and i end up with a huge bowl of stuff. 

I was wondering if this may hinder proper digestion and therefor nutrition: my guess is that the stomach acids won't discriminate and will break each food apart regardless of how you're ingesting it, but honestly im not sure: in the last two weeks that i've been doing this my digestion was clearly hindered (constipation) and it seems like that my body is struggling even more after each meal to digest them this way (my body temperature drops, ecc).  So im wondering if eating things this way can somehow harm absorption and nutrition as well?

Please keep in mind im not trying to break rule 2: im just trying to figure out if what im doing is healthy or if i should try to change my habits and just eat each plate apart from each other. 

Thank you!"
nutrition,Is there a way to change microbiome?,"Assuming you had a crappy microbiome because all you ate was junk food and dairy for several years.

There is  **100 trillion** microbes. It also seems like if you eat something it normally killed off in the stomach.

Seems to be this

Kombucha

Kimchi

Kefir

Probiotics

The problem is say the max strength probiotics you can buy from a store is 1.5 billion microbes, but my understanding is most of them will get killed in stomach. Also 100 trillion is really huge compared to 1.5 billion. 

Maybe Kombucha works, but that might be placebo effect or say just the effects of tea itself."

nutrition,Vitamin D: What you need to know,"Vitamin D is a pro hormone with a plethora of benefits to the human body.¬† Sadly, in excess of 1 billion people are deficient, worldwide.

The benefits of Vitamin D include:

1. Decreased risk of bone loss and breakage in older age
2. Improved bone health through calcium metabolism and bone morphisms
3. Enhanced immune system
4. Aids fat loss
5. Improves strength
6. Reduces depressive symptoms
7. Associated benefits with cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disorders and cancer

Currently the UK recommended intake of Vitamin D is 600IU per day. Remember, these are recommendations based on an overall population and are not figures to be strived for.

Interestingly the Endocrine Society recommends an intake of 1500-2000IU of vitamin D3 per day, a significant difference and more aligned with optimal health. Most good supplements will have around 4000IU of Vitamin D3, which is a great bench marker, any more is unnecessary and more sunlight exposure will show further significant health benefits.

It is hard to overdose Vitamin D, in fact some studies show that there is an increased risk of vascular calcification (a common ‚Äòreported‚Äô side effect of Vitamin D overdose) from a deficiency rather than an overdose.¬† however there is limited research to suggest that doses greater than 4000-5000IU elicit any further benefit on a chronic basis.

Deficiency markers cross over with the symptoms of other deficiencies, which is why it is best to adopt a multi disciplinary approach.¬† Fatigue, feelings of weakness and aches are all symptoms of vitamin D deficiency, but are also markers of dehydration and iron deficiency.¬† In some cases, vitamin D deficiency leads to and Rickets in children.

nutrition,Solution for a college student with a no-kitchen room?,"Hello, I am a college student with a room that has no kitchen. I have rice cooker, small blender and water heater however.

I've been doing it for awhile but it's tiring and I want a more convenient yet nutritious eats and cheap. Btw, I am also suffering from ED (binge-restrict cycle but lately just binges. I don't go to stores and buy bunches of junk food. Just eat whatever I can find in my room like banana or whatever but it does make me feel really, really awful. It's a rather complicated issue actually) and trying to recover.  


So, today I got an epiphany. Why not just buy a bunches of apples, sweet potatoes, potatoes, eggs and tofus, maybe spinach to make juice. My idea is to just boil those that need to be boiled and put it in my fridge. What do you guys think? I'm annoyed cooking everyday and falling into binges cycles during the busiest, stressful uni time (midterm or finals month) and feeling stressed theres nothing to eat in fridge and that I have to go all the way to the kitchen but I do not feel like buying junks cause it actually adds up in costs and I'd like to avoid that  I'll also be consuming fish oil and vitamin if that helps. Will that be nutritionally ok? Will I fall into binges cycle? üòî"

It can be used to calculate personal daily requirement, or just in order to see does the particular food have enough vitamin E to cover its PUFA content (lot of the ""healthy"" nuts do not).

**Example:** Almonds need 8mg per 100g of Vitamin E to cover their PUFA content, and they have 26mg per 100g, which makes them an excellent source of vitamin E.

The calculator is based on this study: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4594047/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4594047/)

Let‚Äôs say that one wants to lose fat in order to have his abs showing. A calorie deficit works with removing fat, but is a calorie deficit while eating healthy food more efficient or is losing fat 100% about calories in and out?

nutrition,Sodium Cyclamate artificial sweetener,"There had been a debate in the past on whether or not consumption of Sodium cyclamate is linked to bladder tumors, causing its ban in the USA. In Europe it is sold in both liquid and tablet forms.


""Cyclamate was banned from use in many countries
because the results of some rat-feeding studies showed the substance to cause bladder tumors. Many scientists questioned the results of the original studies, and this led to many follow-up studies in a variety of
animal species. 
Of note are the results of a 22-year feeding study in monkeys carried out by the National Institutes of Health in the USA that showed that neither cyclamate (nor saccharin) demonstrated any evidence of carcinogenic effects. 
The prevailing opinion today is that neither cyclamate nor cyclohexylamine is likely to be carcinogenic to humans, especially at the levels recommended for diet foods""


""The main reason now that cyclamate is not permitted is that during the follow-up feeding studies to evaluate its carcinogenicity, it was observed that cyclohexylamine, the main metabolite of cyclamate, caused irreversible testicular atrophy in rats.""

nutrition,Bean Sensitivity,"I had a feeling that I might be sensitive to beans. They have a history of causing bloating, gas, and intestinal discomfort. So, I cut out beans for 2 months before reintroducing them to see how I feel. I have been eating one can of beans every day for a week now. The first two days felt fine, but I had a little gas. I have felt worse with each successive day. My sleep quality has reduced because I can't stop farting. Yesterday, I noticed that my intestines don't feel right. Today, the intestinal discomfort got worse, and I started getting cramping pain in my abdomen's side.    


I've been told that if I have problems with beans, the solution is to eat more beans, and eventually I will be fine on them. Should I continue eating beans in the hopes that I eventually get better. People say beans are healthy, but I don't want to eat them anymore."

nutrition,I feel just..... Amazing!!,"Soooo, I for the last idk, pretty much my 21 years of existence have never been one to make sure to drink my 64oz of water a day... or make sure to get my proper nutrition... I basically just ate whatever and didn‚Äôt think about the risks... I was never ‚Äúobese‚Äù but I was always a bit overweight. Fast forward to about 3 months ago and I started noticing worsening acid reflux... I didn‚Äôt really think about it much because I always had a bit of it and figured I must have just had to much spicy foods, until I starting getting stomach pain and just over all feeling bad pretty much all the time.... finally I decided I should book a doctors appointment to find out what‚Äôs going on and if I need any medication to clear up whatever is causing this.

After explaining to my Doctor what was going on she informed me that I more than likely damaged my stomach fairly badly, I was experiencing quite awful burning feelings in my stomach, all over my abdomen, having ‚Äúunpleasant‚Äù bowel movements, etc... so she prescribed me a medication (I believe it was Omeprazole) and told me I need to eat better, take some probiotics and MOST IMPORTANTLY drink more water.... I mean I would say I had gone about 2 months prior to this having maybe 5 bottles of water total in those 2 months and on top of that drinking 4 cans of Mountain Dew and 2 cans of RedBull a day. 

I‚Äôve come to realize how seriously I took this advice... I mean since that day I‚Äôve had maybe 2 cans of pop and 0 energy drinks, haven‚Äôt had any fast food since, and have been pretty much only drinking water with the occasional Gatorade Zero because I mean cmon I‚Äôm not Perfect haha.

Now, my point here is I‚Äôm sure 99% of you folk eat well and don‚Äôt need any convincing to do so... but I do however think some of you ‚ÄúHealth Nuts‚Äù will find it pretty cool to know that I genuinely have never felt better and have never had this much energy, RedBull has nothing on just giving your body the nutrients it needs to work properly haha, I literally wake up and feel like I slept for 48 hours and have consistent good energy all day... I feel healthy and I feel happy... my relationship is better, I‚Äôm wayyyy less moody, my skin is better, my recovery from workouts feels like I‚Äôm damn Spider-Man, I just feel.....AMAZING.

I will most definitely never go back to those habits haha. This is mostly just a ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs on your mind‚Äù post but I had to just tell someone or in this case someone‚Äôs because it‚Äôs just so great to feel well, Great!

I keep being confused about Vitamin E, and watching Masterclass with Chris Masterjohn seems to have created more questions than it answered.

The US guidelines of Vitamin E seems to be 15mg per day, at least according to Cronometer.  
The NHS UK recommends 4mg for men and 3mg for women, which is significantly lower than the US guidelines.  
Sweden recommends 10mg for men and 9 mg for women.  
Germany recommends 13-15mg for men, and 12mg for women.

Supposedly they can't all be correct. I know it depends a bit about how much PUFA you are consuming as well, and I try to not go too high above recommendations.

It's just all so confusing, and I would love to be able to lower the 15mg recommendation to make it easier for myself because I am already draining all of my brainpower into trying to create a relatively sustainable weekly food menu that covers all my nutritional needs and is still relatively palatable. But I want to make sure I am really getting all that I need to promote health.

I know some say our need for Vitamin E is exaggerated, but NHS UK's 3-4mg seems extremely low compared to every other guideline I have come across.

Does anyone have a relatively good answer to this? What are our own nutritional goals for Vitamin E?

Thank you."

nutrition,Is it safe to take vitamin c and calcium supplements?,"https://youtu.be/ZXrNH9urLEM

I‚Äôm only concerned with what this guy says in the first 7 minutes, so no need to watch the full 20 unless you decide to. But I‚Äôm planning on taking calcium supplements without eating any dairy or red meat. Will it cause kidney stones or is there any way someone can elaborate whether this is accurate or not? Or if at the very least taking Calcium is safe? 

I‚Äôm also going to be taking other vitamins (all of which you‚Äôd find in a multivitamin or one a day)"
nutrition,Do calorie labels include ingredients you're supposed to add that arent in the package?,"I'm making instant mashed potatoes, says on the box it's 400 calories per pouch. But it says on the box to add 1.5 cups water, 0.5 cups milk, and 2 tbsp butter to this. Does that 400 calorie figure include only the potato flakes, or does it also take the milk/butter into account? I assume it's the latter since nobody would eat the flakes on their own?"
nutrition,How to reduce oil consumption,"Lately I've been trying to stop using oil in my cooking and get my fat from healthier sources, so I'm avoiding fried and deep fried food and use oil minimally when baking/roasing. But everything tastes so much better when fried, even just pan fried with a little oil makes such a difference than no fat at all. 

The thing is, I know olive oil, avocado oil and butter are relatively healthier alternatives (in moderation, of course) to plain canola or corn oil, but those currently pretty expensive for my budget and generally less affordable where I live. So I'm mostly stuck with vegetable (corn) oil.

I also want to know, how much oil is considered okay to consume in a day? Exactly how bad is oil for us? I don't necessarily use a lot when I cook, but a little times 3-4 meals a day still makes a generous amount each day. How can I reduce the amount of oil that I use without my food being bland? Or should I try to reduce it, even?"
nutrition,Maintained Muscle and strength with just food. How is this possible?,"The last day I‚Äôve ever worked out was March 1, 2020, since then I haven‚Äôt touched a single weight or exercised once. My calories have decreased dramatically from 3,000 a day (60% protein, 20% fat, and 20% Carbohydrates.) Body weight as of March 1, 2020 was 165lbs. 

November 25, 2020 my body weight is now 138lbs and I only eat about 1,000 calories a day, if that. The sources of my meals are mainly Carbohydrates (Potatoes, Rice, etc.) I hardly eat any protein (1-2 ounces a day,) and do not exercise at all. 

Lately I‚Äôve noticed a slight decrease in muscle mass as well as a very slight decrease in overall strength despite constantly being in a Caloric Deficit. I do fast for 18+ hours, sometimes 24 hours depending on my mood. During the fasting period I drink Mineral enhanced water and take my supplements. 

Aside from a drastic decrease in my activity and overall calories I feel fine and have noticed an increase in vascularity and lean muscle. I have kept a decent amount of muscle. 

I don‚Äôt at all look malnourished either, which is weird. 

With all that said, is it possible that I‚Äôve been able to maintain my muscle and strength with just food? 

Is it the vitamins and supplements that have kept me from Muscle Atrophy? 

Is a diet like this moderately healthy considering my lack of calories and or protein consumption? 

How is it possible that I still am able to maintain muscle, despite being inactive?"

There's a lot of nutrients here and its hard to find information on them, especially reliable information with research and sources. You might have noticed that the front page has filled out various columns that are subject to change as well as the format they are presented in. This is meant to be a summary page of these nutrients.

You will also notice there's no information on any other pages as I have yet to gather enough data to go through compile in a notes document and place into here. And I could really use some help finding the data for each and every one of the nutrients shown in the first page. 

I also know that there are some micronutrients that help with things in the body, antioxidants and fat soluble compounds like piperine and Diarylheptanoids(like curcumin), and many more secondary metabolites with various effects on the body. 

These aren't primary nutrients so they won't be on the front page, but I do have pages dedicated to these extras in the back. There are just so many we don't know enough about or lack significant research in with proper trials or statistical data, that if I focused in on them I don't think this would ever be properly finished. So those might get their own spreadsheet later on. 

*Once completed this will be **free to the public** to share around so that everyone can know what their body needs.* 

Likewise I have another spreadsheet book focusing on on plants with all their components listing hyperaccumulators, useful compounds, how much water till fully matured how much of the plant is harvestable, etc. Even plants that don't have a typically considered useful feature like how the stamen of blue spiderwort(Tradescantia) will change color if exposed to radiation. Which of you got some plants with nutritional data about them I will use it in both books so people can know where to get their nutrition from in an optimal fashion.

On the other hand, other sources say it may just have been a regular almond that has gone bad.

This is about a large dinner plate of whole fruits, vegetables, mushrooms and legumes (leafy greens need a different measurement as they weigh less).

&gt; Similar associations were observed for fruits and vegetables separately. Reductions in risk were observed up to 800 g/day for all outcomes except cancer (600‚Äâg/day). Inverse associations were observed between the intake of apples and pears, citrus fruits, green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, and salads and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, and between the intake of green-yellow vegetables and cruciferous vegetables and total cancer risk. An estimated 5.6 and 7.8 million premature deaths worldwide in 2013 may be attributable to a fruit and vegetable intake below 500 and 800 g/day, respectively, if the observed associations are causal.

nutrition,Question about iron absorption with calcium and vitamin C,"I've read that calcium-rich foods inhibit iron absorption, while those rich in vitamin C help absorb it.

Are you still reducing the absorption of iron? There's this iron-fortified milk I've bought recently. It is fortified with both iron and vitamin C. I don't know if it's actually useful, or if the calcium content is going to reduce the iron absorption."

nutrition,Weekly fasts bad for you?,"Hi,

Has anyone came across any evidence and/or educated suspicions that weekly short fasts (36h in my case) could be bad in some way?

For several months now, I've been doing daily time restricted eating (14:10 or 16:8) followed by around 36h hour fast every Sunday (between dinner on Saturday and Breakfast on Monday). I'm doing that mostly due to the many reported metabolic health benefits rather than a diet (however I do eat at a daily surplus due to my exercise goals, so that's also a way to not build up too much extra fat and build lean muscle mass, in theory at least).

I'm feeling fine and I strongly believe that fasts are a great health tool, but maybe I shouldn't be doing 36h every week, and instead do a similar regimen every two weeks or a month, for instance?

I'd be grateful for any advice on the matter!"

How do I know which sites to trust? Is there a reliable source for nutritional information?


**Note**: I'm not looking for a calorie calculator app, what I'm after is the nutritional values of each ingredient I might want to look up (example: a fruit, a certain type of fish, etc.) Like if I for whatever reason want to compare the nutritional values of a banana and olive oil (2 random examples), it gets difficult when each site gives olive oil different values per 100g...

nutrition,"It baffles me that while proper nutrition is meant to be a staple for good health and well-being, there is a lack of consistency of what ""health"" or ""proper nutrition"" actually is. And at the same time, it feels that the health aspect of proper health is constantly replaced with marketing.","I have a long history with nutrition and fitness. 

I do not call myself an expert by any means.

I do however have a psychology degree and I can mostly say from my observations towards nutrition and wellbeing and fitness and reflections from my own experience in the subject.

I must admit, even I struggle to maintain a balance with proper nutrition, especially because I also have my own vices because I am a foodie and I like to eat and experience different cuisines like an adventure or an experience.

At the same time, I also have a rough history with nutrition and fitness.

I was overweight when I was young and while I am not overweight now, I still have those tiny fears of being overweight again even though I (supposedly) know more how to take care of my body and health.

I also had an eating disorder long ago (and maybe a slight obsession with fitness and a bit of orthorexia) and while it is gone now, the temptations and vices still lurks in the back of my mind and I am constantly fighting against it while also questioning whether my actions towards being healthy or disciplined are actually my own choices, or are influenced by voices in the background.

And yes, I also struggle with mental issues and sometimes, food is a comfort, and so is fitness sometimes (in a bad way - a way of feeling like I am in control).


But over the years, I took a deep dive into the whole idea of nutrition and proper health for the sake of cutting out my rough patches and reshaping my mentality towards nutrition and look into the science and back up my habits with verified material rather than what my gut says or based on the rumors and habits that I gained over the years.

And throughout my years of searching into this subject, the more baffled I get.

For starters, it is both interesting and confusing that the ""health"" is very ambiguous and this has become a good opprutunity for people to exploit this into their own interests.

I have encountered many things that are still being debated whether they are healthy or not or useful or not. Heck, even I feel for this throughout my journey- low-fat diets, dietary supplements, fitness routines that have been done by someone who is into fitness instead of someone who is more qualified, fads and unverified research that people still believe or said rumors about (what is using called ""bro science"")

I was even shocked when I learned that the whole idea that fat makes you fat was a big inaccuracy and was pushed by the sugar industry to sell more sugar and we already know the unhealthy side of what sugar does if taken in excess.

And then there are the other complications about maintaining a balance with proper nutrition and diet and fitness- culture.

Let's face it - we live in an era of excess yet at the same time, we are constantly bombarded with ads that capitalise on what we receive from said excesses.

We have choices of many kinds - different foods of every flavour and preference, healthy, non-healthy, small, large and even super large. 

At the same time, we are also exposed with ads about fitness and diets and physical image and abs and muscles and so on.

And this is where I get really confused sometimes and ask ""what do I really want?""

More often than not, the science towards fitness and nutrition is all super complicated and not consistent. Everyone has their own opinions and conclusions and maybe some are financed by the wrong people or people interpret the results differently. 

I keep on realising that the whole idea with health with regards to nutrition and fitness and wellbeing are all so super complicated that is no ""one size fits all"" approach yet I feel as though we are constantly being fed with this but with multiple different ways and patterns while at the same time, being constantly pressured to buy, or look and consume or obsess about many things that may in the end be unhealthy- sugary products, models with certain physiques, fitness cultures with certain unhealthy attitudes towards fitness lifestyle and diet choices.

It is no wonder many people are confused when nutrition and dieting and fitness are involved and no wonder many people end up with eating disorders or mental problems or feeling like they have no control over their own lives when it comes to health.

Heck, sometimes even I am confused about all this with my own life when it comes to health and even I feel like I am not sure what I am doing."
nutrition,"It feels as though my body is fighting against me - need advice, please?","
I would like to ask this question because I am not sure if anyone can help me regarding this matter.


I am not sure if anyone else experiences or brought this up before but it feels as good my body is constantly fighting against me.

Sometimes it is constipation. Sometimes it is bloating. Sometimes it is mix of both or something else entirely.

I thought that fitness and proper dieting should make this better but for some reason, there is an inconsistency on how this happens - sometimes there are good days, sometimes there are bad days.

And I am a person who, while I have had a rough relationship with fitness and diet (and I am still learning because I am a foodie and also have a bit of a bad history with dieting- eating disorders that still lurk in the back of my mind even though they happened many years ago)

It is as though I am constantly trying to keep my body in line and I have been going through this for years.

It completely interferes with my focus and ruins the feeling of progress throughout my fitness journey (and I also noticed that this issue somehow stops or minimized when I stop working out for a while).

 And at the same time, it constantly interferes with my focus throughout the day as well.

I thought that with better dieting choices and fitness, I should feel more in control or more in touch with my body but for some reason, I still struggle with this.

I have tried many things- diet changes, fibre, remedies that tackle sinus problems, proper sleep (still working on that) meditation in case it is a psychological issue (I also think that this is a highly possible because I suffer from mental health issues and I am probably so self-conscious about this that it paradoxically reinforces itself)

I still have not managed to get to the bottom of this.

I dont think that this is a food intolerance issue (a medical professional told me that food intolerances are made up and not backed up by the medical industry) or maybe it is all in my head that is doing this.

But it is annoying and makes me feel irritated or unable to stay focused during the rest of the day.

Is there a way to actually tackle this that minimises my risks of losing focus esepcially during workout days and the rest of my days as well?"

Hey,

So I recently stumbled upon this really good offer for natural soy protein isolate and ending up buying 5 kg (not having tried it before).

The thing is, I have about 4.5 kg left which in rough terms is around 4 kg of pure protein (91g protein per 100g). I'm thinking if there is anything else I can do with it like baking, cooking or blending it with something? I've already tried with 2/3 part gainer and 1/3 part soy protein and even that is bad.

However incoherent, poorly elaborated information online seem to imply that vitamins actually get destroyed, as in their molecular structure is destroyed, by long exposure to heat.

nutrition,Frutarians and Fatty Liver,"People always say fruit is healthy and different from sugar because despite the fructose, no one usually eats enough amount of fruit for it actually be an issue (even 6-8 servings a day seem fine).

But what about someone following an extreme diet like only/mostly fruit? Raw or frutarian vegans for example. I know they aren't exactly a large enough group for it to be worth having real scientific data, but do we have any reports/exams preferably from frutarians that indicate they have fatty liver/higher visceral fat because of the massive consumption of fructose? They don't look healthy, but are usually are extremely skinny despite consuming massive amount of calories and fructose.

Usually people who drink and have high visceral fat, despite also being skinny, have a protruded midsection, but that isn't the case for frutarians."

I've also got one called 'MealPlanner' which is far more simple and allows you to manually input what you're having for each meal, each week but it doesn't allow you do import recipes, so i am unable to use the apps in conjunction with each other without manually copying the data across!

Surely I'm not the only one who would like these things out of the apps? Or do you have to upgrade to premium? That maybe the case, but the recipe ones give no hint of meal planning and focus more on nutritional advice if you upgrade."

What's the difference  between the ""bangs"" which have 300 mg vs ""monsters"" that have 160 mg.  Would you only be able to drink one ""bang"" a day vs 2 ""monsters a day?

I  am also thinking about switching to coffee but a problem I've had is  the amount of liquid you have to drink to get the same effect as an  energy drink. I can't figure out how to know how much caffeine is in  each oz or tablespoon (instant coffee) coffee has. It's not in the  nutritional info. So how do I figure out how much caffeine is in my  drink and how to drink less liquid for the same effect as an energy  drink with coffee.

For example, if a 1 cup serving of peas is stated to have 8g protein, is that truly 8g, or is it 8g*.6 = 4.8g actually absorbable?

&gt;In January 1993, FDA suggested the use of PDCAAS in food labeling for evaluating protein quality. Pre-existing regulations, at CFR¬ß 101.9(c)(7), required the use of PDCAAS for determining whether a food contained a significant amount of protein per serving and for calculating the percent DV for protein.

for example, on Halloween I had hotdogs, but the nutritional info was on the pack. a few days ago my mom cooked pork chops, and I did not have the nutritional info but I was able to google it and found that it's X amount of calories and protein per ounce. so I put it on a food scale and estimated the calories. by that logic I'm curious if there's a formula like that for all types of meat when I don't have access to the nutrition info?"

I have been strength training at the gym for over a month with quick intense cardio sessions at the end. I've started to see strength results but only minimal weight loss wise.

Fish chicken or pork for protein
5 small nugget potatoes
Broccoli or other veg

Snacks of apples, oranges and bananas with sometimes mixed nuts for snacking.

I have no problems eating the same things but I'm looking for healthy alternative for snacks. Maybe I'm not doing enough to accelerate the weight loss.

Now I know this is a touchy subject what with 50% of all trade with China being illegal blackmarket sale of infant fetuses grown in underground labs in Wuhan and the DPRK. 

It's pretty obvious the Democrat Elite (D.E.) have a stranglehold on this supply chain to ensure Joe Biden survives long enough for Kamala to take over, and also to gift President Trump with a two-years supply so he'll just quietly go even though he was cheated out of the position by several hundred thousand dead democrats; largely ex-republicans who died of 'slightly-worse-than-regular-flu-flu' (lol get wrecked racist douche-bags).

  
So China is sketchy and plus I don't know Hunter Biden well enough to broach the conversation anyway, even though I've seen his dick more times than Mandingo has seen the torn up inside out insides of a borderline anorexic white girls anal cavity/chasm.  


How do you guys propose I go about *legally* acquiring less than two day old infant plasma? I do have connections to a private lab in Canada willing to synthesise peptides (don't ask it's invite only) and other advanced neutraceuticals, but they charge more than double for 'I Can't Believe It's Not Infant Plasma,' with no money-back guarantee.

nutrition,If vegetable oils are bad then what about seeds and nuts?,"So seed and vegetable oils can be bad due to their high polyunsaturated fat and/or omega-6 content. Which dramatically raises the amount of oxidized LDL in our arteries. I believe this to be so. Then what do you think about eating a moderate amount of seeds (ground flaxseed) or nuts (almonds, walnuts, peanuts)? Which scenario do you think if more likely?

1.  Any amount of polyunsaturated fats will (vegetable oils) will damage your arteries
2. Nuts and seeds have other benefits (like anti-cancer lignans, soluble fiber, phytonutrients) which offset the risk of oxidized LDL, so its a neutral wash if eaten in moderation, and if only if your net energy intake is negative or zero.
3. If you're a thin person, then a high polyunsaturated fat intake (nuts, seeds) may be alright as maybe any fat gets metabolized for energy rather than hanging around very long and getting oxidized in your bloodstream.

So her program has also small meals between the basic 3 ones if needed (like a fruit with a piece of cheese and a piece of bread for example).

nutrition,Unpopular Opinion: You're getting enough nutrients,"I see on this thread all the time about people wanting to make sure eating a certain way or eating along with certain things will get you enough nutrients. In medical school we learned that it's ironic that so many health nuts take daily vitamins because in an industrialized western society, the grand majority of people even with fairly poor diets are still getting the minimum amount of vitamins and minerals for your necessary biological processes. Therefore, we are just peeing out the excess. In clinic we rarely see anyone with a vitamin deficiency. I've asked an attending pediatrician this and he's never seen a case of scurvy. And rickets is super rare and screams parental neglect or an absurd diet from a picky child that any normal human would know is not sustainable. You'd pretty much have to actively try as an adult that's health conscious enough to be on this sub to get a vitamin deficiency and you'd know when it happens. Additionally I know a lot of people around here are trying to lose weight or up their fitness, so you're already getting too many nutrients or know to not eat only chicken mcnuggets for every meal. 

There's some evidence that a partial Vit D deficiency can have mental effects like lethargy, so if you're worried about that then take a Vit D supplement, but you really do not need to worry about whether your diet is getting enough nutrients or if things like tea are going to prevent you from getting nutrients"

nutrition,How do you get your vitamin C?,"Compared to other vitamins, I've noticed it's difficult to get adequate vitamin C through just ""varying"" up your diet.

So, how do you, personally, get enough vitamin C on a daily basis? Do you just eat 1 orange every day?"

Wouldn't this lead to less muscle gains? Because cold water has also showed to reduce ""muscle damage"" because it reduced inflammation. And , since it reduced inflammation, less muscle gains developed.

nutrition,9 HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA YOU PROBABLY NEVER KNEW ABOUT,"**Greater flexibility**

The yoga routine includes muscle-strengthening poses. After just eight weeks of regular yoga practice, some people have noticed a 35% increase in flexibility! No matter what level of yoga you are practicing, you are holding poses that you inhale and exhale over and over again, which can increase your flexibility.

**More happiness**

Several thinking activities can improve mental health, but yoga is useful. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin found that people who meditate have more activity in the brain‚Äôs left prefrontal cortex. Increased activity in the left prefrontal cortex was associated with a higher sense of well-being.

According to these findings, the most effective postures to improve mental health focus on relaxation. Try sitting on a lotus flower or practicing the King of the Dance pose as part of your yoga routine."
nutrition,Just how effective are juice cleanses? Talking juice cleanses w/ Dr. Faisal Rehman- Hashtag Health podcast,"**HH:** Joining us today is nephrologist and researcher Dr. Faisal Rehman. A nephrologist is a kidney specialist and as a nephrologist, part of Dr. Rehman's job is to monitor and correct electrolyte, nutrient, and acid-base disturbances in the human body. 

**FR:** My name is Faisal Fehman. I'm a professor of medicine here at the Schulich School of Medicine (UWO in London, Ontario) and I specialize in Nephrology, or kidney disease, and I also do quite a bit of internal medicine as well.

Yeah, so to me, it's similar to if you ingest a whole bunch of vitamins, will you replenish your vitamin stores more? The fact of the matter is if you overeat any specific type of vitamins or consume heavy amounts of vitamins whether it's from the form of food or not, you're just going to excrete it in your urine and it‚Äôll be out of your system. So many of us are not deficient in any spots or two specific vitamins, the B1 vitamin. We are deficient, in Canada, probably in vitamin D. Probably most of us are deficient in vitamin D. So if you take more vitamin D rich foods or vitamin D supplements that makes. But most of us are not deficient in the vitamin B complex that supplements have and C and other important essential vitamins. So all that extra stuff we take with us and from juicing or in the form of pills is just going to be pissed out your kidneys. So I think it's a waste of time again and not, in my opinion, any useful healthy lifestyle modification that's going to change your life. 

**HH:** So just like taking a daily vitamin supplement, if your body isn't deficient in it to begin with, the extra vitamins found in the fruit and vegetable juice just gets peed out. Now, that's the case with water soluble vitamins, which includes vitamins C and all the different vitamin Bs. There's also fat soluble vitamins -- vitamins A, D, E, and K. These ones don't get peed out and once absorbed from the diet, linger around in our body's liver and fatty tissues. Here's another good point -- Dr. Rehman points to the fact that by only taking in the juices of fruits and vegetables that people miss out on another key component of a health diet - FIBER!

**FR:** I would say that for your digestive health. It's probably just as important to have the fiber part of the fruit and vegetables than just the juice when you're taking in a juice. You still haven‚Äôt necessarily digested the carbohydrate moieties or whatever comes in with that vegetable or fruit. So I don't see that as being a point to improve your health and the digestive process going through the digestive process of fiber is actually better for your gut health and for your bacterial flora in your gut. And when you give up fiber you run into issues with constipation and other health issues. 

**HH:** Another reason why many people go on juice cleanses is to lose weight. And fair enough. If they follow the juice cleanse as instructed, most people will likely shed some pounds. This is because juice cleanses will result in people eating fewer calories than they normally would. During juice cleanses, people end up consuming around 800-1200 calories per day. And unless you're a toddler between the ages of 2-3, this puts you at a caloric deficit, with the recommended caloric intake for men being around 2500 and for women, 2000. Now, most juice cleanses only last a few days -- anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks. So let's say you drop 10 pounds during that time period. Will you gain it back? Now let's also take note that there is a disclaimer found in most juice cleanse related blog posts - ""don't do this juice cleanse without consulting your doctor first"". So what does Dr. Rehman Have to say?

**FR:** So personally I'm against any kind of extreme measure to obtain your goals, especially when it pertains to weight loss because unfortunately with most of those mechanisms, the gains are short-term and often people gain the fat weight right back. So that's one issue. This is because it's not sustainable to keep doing that behavior. The second thing about extreme measures is that they have unintended consequences and potential side effects and bad things which I've seen, so just to get that out there with respect to juicing per se. A few concerns. So when you take vegetables and fruits and you blend them down and you separate out the juice and you drink that is your primary source of nutrition, you're probably getting a lot of carbohydrates you getting some vitamins you getting very little fiber. Fiber is a very important part of the fruit and vegetable which is important for bowel health, but you're likely not getting enough protein. You're not getting enough fat and with respect to healthy weight loss that cannot be good. You know, you lose too much muscle mass perhaps and we were talking earlier before the interview even about electrolyte abnormalities, you know. If  you're taking in a ton of free water in the form of these juices, you're not getting enough solute. You can become profoundly hyponatremic as well in extreme cases.

And again, like I mentioned you're prone to other nutritional deficiencies. I've seen patients come in who've gone on diets similar to juicing with profound iron deficiency anemia. The hemoglobin was 50 and the young nurse that I saw, she came to me saying I feel unwell, and she looked unwell. And I checked her bloodwork and she had life-threatening anemia because she'd gone on an extreme diet.

nutrition,Talking GMOS and natural food in interview with professor of health law Tim Caulfield,"**Hashtag Health:** Okay, so our next question is you, we talked about Jenny McCarthy already, but over the past few years, what are your top three most notable examples of science, misinformation, and what has been their impact? 

**TC:** So much, so much science. Misinformation. It's hard. It's hard to pick. So I'm going to bounce around from, from things that are kind of trivial to things that are really serious.

Let's start with anti-vaccs one, right? Cause I really think that is, is significant. And so much has been said about it, but one of the reasons it's important is, number one, it's had a real impact, a real measurable impact. You know, people around the world are suffering. 

So I think that that's one of the reasons we absolutely need to highlight that one. In addition to that, I think it's also mobilized people around the idea of misinformation. You know, I've been doing this for a really long time and people are taking the issue of misinformation more seriously, I think because of, because of what's happening in the context of vaccines.

Um, I think you're also seeing it with things like  GMOs. You know, the misinformation being spread about GMOs and the potential adverse harm. Now that one's more of a complex story, right? And that's one of the reasons it's a little bit difficult to grapple with that one.

Uh, but there's also a lot of misinformation about GMOs. That is, that they're, they're bad for your health. You know, with GMOs, I‚Äôm always putting these in three categories. One, is it bad for your health? You know, is it bad for the environment? And, what about corporate ownership? Well, the reason people avoid GMOs is because the first one, and that's what we have research to back that up.

And there's absolutely no evidence to support the idea that GMOs are bad for your health. Right. Uh, so it's a really good example, I think of, of how something that can become almost a truism in certain communities, that GMOs are bad for your health, despite the lack of evidence. You know, its impact on the environment and biodiversity, I think is more complex.

For sure. I've, you know, I'm so skeptical about whether there's a definitive answer there, but absolutely something we need to consider. And also with the corporate ownership issue. But again, another really good example of the spread of misinformation. 

Um, another interesting one I think is the concept of natural. Like if it's natural, it's, it's good for you. Um, I, I think that that is also  really problematic because it creates confusion around. It causes people, I think, to think that living a healthy lifestyle is harder than it really is. Perhaps it causes a community- and there's a little bit of research to back this up- causes communities and individuals to spend more money than they need to on eating a healthy diet. So the idea, you know, the naturalistic fallacy, I think is another really big, uh, problem. 

And then of course, you can dig into some of the fun ones that are still, I think, really problematic.

Uh, and one of them is the idea of detoxification, right? This idea that we need to detox our bodies. That one's taken hold over the last decade, and has not let go despite the fact there's no evidence to support it. Um, and it is problematic because often the idea of detoxing is attached to a little bit of boost your immune system naturally, which is code for anti-vaccs, right? It's code for, don't use pharmaceuticals, do it naturally. Uh, and it also, I think it can lead to real harmful practices like colonics where you could perforate your bowel and it leads to harmful things like extreme diets. Uh, but that, that myth continues to live on. Can I keep going on my list?"

nutrition,How to track meats/poultry when you don‚Äôt always have the luxury of tracking raw weight?,"Let‚Äôs start off my mentioning that I live at home which means most of the cooking that occurs is from parent. Since I am not the one always doing  the cooking, I usually track my meats, poultry and even some veggies in its cooked state. 

I found out a few nights that this whole time I was supposed to be tracking food in its raw state. Why is that so? Today I finally had the opportunity to cook my own lunch so I tried out the gross weight in raw state.

Here‚Äôs an example: I weighed one piece of skinless, boneless chicken breast (126g) when it was raw on MFP and I received these kcal/macros: 139kcal, 39.1g Protein, 1.3g Fat. 

FYI: My family has always been buying from butchers all their/my life‚Äôs, which means I don‚Äôt anything about nutrition labels which I see a lot mentioned within this topic.

That same piece of chicken after cooking weighed in at 73g with these kcal/macros: 77kcal, 16.7g protein, 1g fat. 

I know for a fact that water is definitely lost more or less depending on factors such as cooking method, length and temperature. However, isn‚Äôt water and quite possibly fat the only factors that could be lost through the cooking process? Why is MFP saying the protein is subsequently less once cooked?

Here‚Äôs my real question. What difference does it make if I were to track cooked state over raw? I am not always able to cook my own food."

nutrition,Why do certain diets work for some people but not as well for others?,"This may sound like a stupid and generic question, but I'm really curious. I've been on the keto diet for about a year now, and, while I initially started it to lose weight, I started to reap benefits I'd never expected such as no more lower back pain, better mood, more energy, less gas, sharper thinking, etc. However, I've heard of people who feel very lethargic and on the verge of vomiting fairly frequently when they're on the keto diet. On that note, there are people out there who do really well on a high-carb diet and reap the same benefits out of that diet that I get out of the keto diet, but, when I used to be on a high-carb diet (prior to switching over to a keto diet), I was always lethargic, depressed (didn't feel the desire to do anything or even get out of bed), and I had some wild mood swings.

nutrition,Drinking a significant amount of bouillon cubes," I hope that everyone is doing well!

I've been struggling with some heavy depression recently and I'm  having difficulty taking in water.

I've tried mixing lemon and lime in  with my water and even that is a struggle. I've been getting up in the  middle of the night and drinking large amounts of water and returning to  bed with no issues. 

However, I've found some success in bouillon cubes. I can easily  drink a handful of cups when there are some cubes mixed in. While I'm  drinking the broth I'm also taking in plain water, because the saltiness  makes drinking easier. One cube of broth is 900 mg sodium. I'm usually  drinking 4-8 cups of broth a day. I'm a petite woman and have had some  concerns that I'm not hydrating my body when I'm downing a bunch of  bouillon all day. But I know that electrolytes are also important (I'm  taking magnesium and potassium in the form of pink Himalayan sea salt  and the ""No Salt sodium-free alternative"")

I'm under the care of a doctor but it's been difficult to see her because of the state of the world.

Hello everyone,

I have a quick question. For the longest time before the world change, my workout regimen consisted off crossfit in the morning and running in the evening (if I was up to it).

After my run (if I did it), I would have a regular dinner.

Nowadays, I'm not so keen to doing crossfit considering the potential exposure so I have switched things up. I am running in the morning and lifting weights in the evening. I was wondering what the best time would be to ingest glutamine and protein -- in the morning after running or at night after lifting weights? What about the protein shake?

**Are we all prone to hypertension as we age?**

**-**To avoid hypertension, do I just avoid overworking my kidneys throughout life? And even then, can healthy people just commonly develop hypertension just from genetics anyway? 

\-Can salt intake be padded with other foods? Kind of how sugar is padded by fiber to reduce the blood sugar spike?

\-There seem to be so many older people that avoid salt because of their condition and I'm trying to think about how to avoid that lifestyle change as I age.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why is saturated fat demonized so hard?**

\-I even had a professor say coconut oil is terrible for you because of it's very high sat fat composition. And what about eggs? They're touted as a superfood almost, yet they are often demonized for fat and dietary cholesterol with the older crowd.

\-Thinking about how the French and Mediterranean's eat high sat fat diets and don't have disproportionate weight problems, on top of having greater overall health? 

\-In terms of a traditional ketogenic diet for example, what's wrong with having higher total cholesterol from high sat fat intake? Does it sound right that as long as you have enough HDL for the LDL you have, you're golden? (Also HDL carries LDL from arteries back to liver for processing right?)

\-Opinions on whether high sat fat intake contributes to heart disease or not? I always hit a wall when I pull up different studies both claiming their sides to be true.

Daily, I  usually eat 5 piece of fruit and veg such as; 2 bananas, an apple, some broccoli and a kiwi. Having done some research, I'm already above the recommended daily sugar intake. I calculated that on some days I can have up to 60g of sugar just from trying to get my 5 a day.

After much research I know this is debatable but sugar is still sugar, but I know and I like that I'm getting the benefits of the nutrients from the fruit but I'm uncomfortable with the amount of sugar I'm taking in.

Just a quick question. Oats have a decent amount of iron and zinc. However if you take them raw, the phytic acid will cause those minerals to be absorbed less by the body, for that meal only (not for the whole day - future meals on that same day won't be affected).

I can see the contradiction. On one hand, oats have good amounts of zinc and iron. Yet, when taken raw, the phytic acid makes the body absorb less of those minerals.

So what happens here? Maybe your body can still absorb them a little bit because let's say you have 100 points, phytic acid blocks 40, so you can still absorb 60? Or maybe the opposite, where the phytic acid nullifies all the iron and zinc?"

nutrition,Estimating TDEE With Machine Learning," 

Hey Everyone, a little over a year ago, I made some posts about a web app I created called LogSmarter to help me find my TDEE. I had always had difficulty with determining how many calories to eat to reach my body composition goals and created a tool that would learn from my data and provide personalized feedback. From those posts, over 1000 people signed up to use LogSmarter and the positive response was overwhelming so I decided to continue development. 

What was just a simple web app a year ago has turned into nutrition tracking software that uses machine learning to help people reach and sustain their body composition goals. You tell us your demographic information and whether you want to gain muscle or lose fat. From there our proprietary machine learning algorithm will generate a goal calorie intake that fits your individual needs. 

As you progress towards your goal of gaining muscle or losing fat, your metabolism will change. Based on daily records of your calorie intake and body weight, our algorithm will update your goal calorie intake appropriately to make sure you are optimizing your nutrition. As our algorithm learns more about you, it will provide feedback to make sure you are following the latest evidence based nutrition recommendations.

LogSmarter blends innovative machine learning techniques, the latest evidence based recommendations and keen insight from industry experts to provide our customers with a simple and accessible platform for determining an optimal calorie intake to reach and sustain their body composition goals. 

During the last year, our algorithm for recommending goal calorie intakes has been improved greatly and we have leveraged machine learning to build a very accurate method of TDEE estimation that is accessible through LogSmarter. As of last week, our beta has launched at [https://www.logsmarter.net/#/](https://www.logsmarter.net/#/) , if you're interested in optimizing your nutrition, then you should check it out!"

nutrition,Eating Strategies,"For anyone interested, here are some strategies I use when considering what goes on my plate. These are general rules and framing that may be helpful for some folks. [Full article here](https://saltandiron.net/2020/10/22/whoa-thats-a-lot-of-eggs/), but I've listed the main points listed below.

Nothing revolutionary, just a simple framework that some may find valuable. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Prioritize protein**: Strive to increase the **ratio** of protein on your plate relative to carbs &amp; fat. Example: use bone broth in rice in place of water, or eat one double burger instead of two single burgers (i.e. cut out half the buns). Small tweaks like this are barely noticeable, but massively impactful.
2. **Pursue simplicity**: Have go-to, easy to access meals at the ready. When you open the fridge, ensure you have at least one healthy snack you can easily consume with little frustration. That might require some preparation (i.e. shred grocery store chicken ahead of time). 
3. **Play with dry spices**: An impactful change you can make immediately is to **ditch grocery store bottled sauces**. They are packed with added calories via sugar, and filled with awful seed oils.
4. **Set the foundation**: Aim to have the strictest meal first during any given day (i.e. low carb, high protein). Start with satiating food **first** to help increase the odds you **maintain** the discipline throughout remainder of the day.
5. **Learn to love water**: Make your water more enticing, and make s\*\*\*\*y drinks less appealing. Example: add lemon or cucumber slices to a nice jug of water you keep cold in the fridge **while also** storing any pop in your basement, warm. When you want a coke, make it something you have to plan for. Maybe you're having some pizza on Saturday night as a special treat. Grab a single coke a couple of hours ahead of time to cool it in the fridge. If this seems inefficient, that's because it is, and it should be!"
nutrition,Whole grain contamination,"Hi!

nutrition,Any recipes for homemade energy gels?,"As I‚Äôve started running more and more, a need to fuel during the run has appeared.

What are your (up to) top 10 picks and why? Honorable mentions allowed.



The reason I set it up like this is to avoid people answering with foods that, while they may be very healthy, you could not realistically eat a large enough amount to actually benefit, as well as the use of one-nutrient wonders, especially filled with isolated nutrients that are otherwise easy to obtain.

This way I am hoping we can exchange ideas to end up with a list of nutritionally variable foods that can realistically be included in your everyday diet.

The best thing would be if you could also motivate your answers.

My half-effort list so far, in no particular order:
1. Soybeans/Edamame (very variable nutritionally and a also a great source of potassium. Complete protein)
2. Oats. (Decent source of fiber, easy manganese and a decent amount of other nutrients)
3. Pork (protein source, great source of thiamin and selenium and variable in other nutrients - easy to find lean variety)
4. Broccoli (Brussels sprouts could be better, I am not sure, but I like broccoli and it can be used in a lot of dishes. Decent nutritional profile, plenty of antioxidants.)
5. Salmon. (Fatty acid profile, decent source of Vitamin D and B Vitamins.)
6. Potatoes. ( good nutrient to calorie ratio, nice source of potassium.)
7. Eggs (Easy to eat and great source of choline. Nutritionally variable.
8. Milk. (Easy to drink a lot of, meaning you can get a decent amount of variable nutrients per calorie if you choose a low fat variety. Also possible to evaporate i to an acceptable cream substitute in cooking.

That is my current, incomplete list which I am planning to upgrade in the future.

For now, I would also like to give Kombu seaweed an honorable mention even though it is a one-nutrient wonder for the reason that I am not sure regular whole foods will provide enough Iodine"

If yes, how come?","I'm just a average guy with no nearly to zero knowledge on nutrition and I've been doing some superficial research on the ammount of calories on different foods. Now I'm confuse with the ammount of calories on fat. Let's go step by step: 

1) to gain 1 kg of body fat, you need to consume around 7700 calories;

2) 1 gram of fat provides 9 calories;

3) therefore, eating 1 kg of fat would provide you 9000 calories;

4) 9000 &gt; 7700, which means you would gain more than 1 kg.

nutrition,Should we skip fruits and eat more vegetables?,"I've been comparing fruits to vegetables and it looks like vegetables contain far more fiber, vitamins, minerals and potassium without the fructose/glucose. I'll admit that strawberries, raspberries and blackberries appear healthy for having a rather low sugar count with a good amount of fiber and high vitamin C, but then if you look at fruits like grapes, blueberries and bananas they practically look like candy! Meanwhile, I tried researching why fruits are healthy and for the most part got these:


*They're natural-* Go eat dirt then and tell me that's healthy.


*They're not as unhealthy as products with processed sugar-* Okay, but that doesn't mean that fructose/glucose is also unhealthy. Usually from what I've read its that eating this sugar is healthy in moderation (same with junk food) and that they're worth eating for the other nutrition you're getting from it. Are these carbs in anyway better than fiber, complex carbs or even simple carbs?


*They're filled with vitamins, potassium and fiber-* Yes, but again many vegetables contain far more nutrition per serving without the sugar. And even then, besides vitamin C you're not getting that much of the above.


*They're high in antioxidants-* Isn't that just specific types of vitamins/minerals? If so, see above.


So what am I missing here? Is this natural sugar any better than other carbs besides processed sugar? Is there something in fruits that is usually not on the nutrition facts label?"

nutrition,HEALTH BENEFITS BANANA TEA," 

Banana tea or banana skin tea or boiling banana peels is highly recommended for people who suffer from [insomnia](https://mediscare.net/how-to-treat-pregnancy-insomnia/), [depression](https://mediscare.net/natural-supplements-for-depression/), pregnancy [depression](https://mediscare.net/natural-supplements-for-depression/), chronic anxiety, low immunity, impaired metabolism, high blood pressure, [osteoporosis](https://mediscare.net/how-can-you-prevent-osteoporosis-naturally/), digestive problems, obesity, inflammatory diseases, skin irritation, and for myopia. and for those who recover from a long illness, surgery, or a specific injury.

# Banana Skin Tea Lowers Blood Pressure

[Banana peel tea](https://mediscare.net/benefits-of-banana-peel-tea/) is probably well known because it contains potassium, which helps maintain a healthy heart and lowers blood pressure. potassium is considered a vasodilator, it not only regulates the fluid balance in the body but also reduces stress on the cardiovascular system by relieving tension in the arteries and blood vessels.

# Banana Peel Tea Regulates Sleep

The main benefit of [banana peel tea](https://mediscare.net/benefits-of-banana-peel-tea/) is to treat sleeping problems and [insomnia](https://mediscare.net/how-to-treat-pregnancy-insomnia/).

High levels of tryptophan (an amino acid that makes up most proteins), serotonin (a compound found in platelets and serum that constricts blood vessels), and dopamine (a compound found in the body as a neurotransmitter), found in banana tea have been linked to improving sleep levels and reducing the incidence of [insomnia](https://mediscare.net/how-to-treat-pregnancy-insomnia/).

And restful and uninterrupted sleep in general.

Lack of quality sleep may increase levels of beta-amyloid (an amino acid primarily involved in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease) in the brain, and increase the risk of developing Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (source: [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/)).

# Boiling Banana Peels Can Relieves Depression

The dopamine and serotonin in [banana peel tea](https://mediscare.net/benefits-of-banana-peel-tea/) also help regulate hormone levels and increase [mood](https://mediscare.net/natural-supplements-for-depression/) as they are good neurotransmitters. And if you regularly suffer from anxiety or [depression](https://mediscare.net/natural-supplements-for-depression/), adding banana tea to your diet may be exactly what you need to remedy it.

# Banana Peel Tea Can Improve Bone Density

There is a good variety of minerals in banana tea, including manganese and magnesium, both of which contribute to bone mineral density and may help to prevent [osteoporosis](https://mediscare.net/how-can-you-prevent-osteoporosis-naturally/) altogether with age.

# Banana Skin Tea Helps in The Digestive Process

Potassium and magnesium are known to improve smooth muscle function which is important in the digestive system. This helps stimulate the peristaltic movement (the gradual wave of contraction and relaxation) that regulates bowel movements, thus preventing constipation, bloating, and cramping while also improving nutrient absorption.

# Banana Peel Tea Boosts The Immune System

one of the [benefits of banana peel tea](https://mediscare.net/benefits-of-banana-peel-tea/) strengthens the immunity system. Vitamin C and vitamin A in the bananas peel, help boost the immune system. As each of these vitamins are antioxidants. Ascorbic acid (a vitamin especially found in citrus fruits and green vegetables) stimulates the production of white blood cells, and vitamin A is directly related to preventing oxidative stress (an imbalance between the production of free radicals and the body‚Äôs ability to counter or eliminate their harmful effects through Neutralizing antioxidants) in the retina and prevents macular degeneration (deterioration of the small central part of the retina known as the macular) and the development of cataracts.

# Banana Peel Tea For Weight Loss

You can use banana tea for weight loss because it contains vitamin A, B vitamins, potassium, lutein (a deep yellow pigment found in the leaves of plants and in egg yolks) and other antioxidants. Many of these nutrients contribute to a strong metabolic activity, as well as feelings of fullness and satiety.

In other words, it is possible to increase negative fat burning through the major function of metabolism, and eliminate the desire to snack between meals or overeating. These surrounding effects combined with all that nutrient can aid in weight loss efforts.

[Banana peel tea](https://mediscare.net/benefits-of-banana-peel-tea/) provides many benefits for weight loss, and we can consider consuming the peel itself more effective than the banana tea itself. Since the peel is rich in both soluble and insoluble fibers, most of the benefits of the peel cannot be transferred to tea when steeping a banana.

These two types of fiber are known to slow digestion, suppress the appetite, and boost metabolism so you‚Äôll feel satisfied, thanks to the tryptophan, dopamine, and serotonin present in bananas."

nutrition,What are y'alls thoughts on this? Any research supporting this? Video by Dr. Berry,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwagCofBDj8&amp;ab\_channel=KenDBerryMD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwagCofBDj8&amp;ab_channel=KenDBerryMD)

In this video Dr. Berry talks about:

 1. Nutrient density: Agree

2. Carbohydrate intake: ""*Unlike protein (amino acids) and lipids (fatty acids), there are no carbohydrates essential for human life that the body does not produce. Therefore, modulate carbohydrate intake based on how your body responds to them (i.e., if you experience inflammation or other health problems, try reducing your carbohydrate intake).*"" Agree to an extent.

3. Food sensitivity: Agree

4. Satiety: Agree

5. Fasting: Agree

6. Ancestral appropriateness: ""*Eat mostly foods that humans have eaten for millions of years, such as fatty meats, organ meats, and some plants. Be cautious of foods that humans have eaten for only thousands of years, such as grains, dairy, and alcohol. Avoid foods that humans have only eaten for tens to hundreds of years, such as vegetable/seed oils and highly-processed foods.*"" I have no clue where to start on this... truly, as in I don't know if there's any truth to this or not. Any thoughts? He talks about the vegetable oils and while I know that ""vegetable"" oil isn't good, there are many fantastic fats in canola, safflower, and olive oil.

7. Avoid factory products: Agree, but also some processed foods are really there for convenience of nutrition, so when possible go natural but it's often very difficult to.

8. Adequate minerals: No thoughts

9. Avoid fad diets: ""*The ketogenic diet may seem like a fad but it is actually well-documented in cultures around the world over the course of history. In contrast, modern dietary recommendations have only existed for a few decades and are largely influenced by politics and lobbying.*"" Thoughts on this statement? He also calls pyramid and MyPlate a fad diet made by ""big dairy, etc"". MyPyramid was indeed a mess, but MyPlate, and especially Harvard's version have been vital in helping people.

10. Sugar addiction: Agree

11. Price vs quality: ""*High-quality products are more expensive than low-quality products. Buy high-quality foods when you can afford them, but recognize that even a ""low-quality proper diet"" is typically healthier than a non-proper diet.*"" Don't agree with the expensive comment, but definitely the quality comment."
