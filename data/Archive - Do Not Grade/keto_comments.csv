keto,"I drink Bang a few times a week at most, no issues with it. My rule for energy drinks is the same as diet soda. I buy a set amount each shopping trip, and if I run out before the next trip too bad. I buy the same set amount. If I run out again it is off the menu for a month or so.

My allowance is  just under 3 cans of soda a day plus 2 Bang per week. Since we grocery shop every 2 weeks for small stuff and our grocery store puts the cheap soda on sale 3 12 packs for 7 or 8.00 and Bang is 3.00 for 2 cans.

So far they have both been on the menu within those limits for almost 2 years. If I go light on the soda or don't  drink them, I only buy replacement for what I drank so I am not stockpiling lol. The only things we do not keep at long term pantry levels in our home are special items like this, hubby and I each have our favorite special items. His are Rockstar energy drinks, mine are bang and diet soda."

keto,"Depends on the type. I take citrate capsules, they don't ever make me tired during the day. I believe it might be because it is only 100mg with food.

When I take 1 a few hours before bed I notice a very slight calming feeling but not sedation really.

Now I can't take liquid citrate at all. Even 1 tablespoon in a gallon of diluted ketoade has me on the toilet.

Glycinate seems to make me sleepier but it doesn't keep my mental state balanced, nor does it keep my guts happy. Found that out the hard way, I need a lot more glycinate to be a happy camper. No idea why that is, but I need double the glycinate.

Naturally oxide isn't worth a crap for anything including my guts. And naturally, oxide is what is typically in vitamins and such lol. I have no idea what form is in food, but I suspect what is in food may work because it is part of food.

Also, omega 3 capsules do not work the way fish does. Again, I suspect that is due to omega 3 in food being with the things it needs to be useful so to speak.

Before keto I took boatloads of supplements on top of my meds, I shudder to think about how much I spent on them over the years. 

Now I am down to Morton's lite salt,  magnesium citrate capsules and 1 D3 a day. Mind-boggling. 

And no meds. This 2 year med holiday is my longest in decades, and my OCD is mellower than it has ever been. All time low on checklists, my CBT exercises working great, life is good."

keto,"&gt;Can‚Äôt violate the laws of thermodynamics, if you can‚Äôt burn more calories than you eat, you won‚Äôt lose weight.

Calories in food are measured by combusting them, so you can't just say ""CICO, law of thermodynamics, herp derp"" and be done with it. Your digestive system is not a closed system. You require oxygen, vitamins, minerals, non-caloric nutrients, etc. to metabolize food. Hell, a lot of the food you consume gets shit out undigested. Have you ever heard of indigestion? Your body is not a bomb calorimeter and not every calorie is metabolized the same way or metabolized at all for that matter.

Go look up the concept of ""thermic effect of food"". That concept means that the amount of CO in CICO is itself variable depending on the type of CI consume, and that's independent of the magnitude of the CI and other factors like exercise that affect CO."
keto,What keto creamer do you use? I haven't found one yet that is really affordable for my budget so I tend to stick with black coffee or Viennas (long black with cream) if I'm getting a barista coffee.

Would you mind sharing what a week of your typical meals is?"
keto,"Wow. You know your stuff. TY

My A1C was at one time in the pre-diabetic range but that was before I cut out all sugar.

So, idk if the stuff you wrote relates much to this, but I'll tell you where I'm at now with diet and maybe you can tell me, in view of the analysis above, what you think.

I started carnivore on 4/12. Just ribeye and liver. Got uncontrollable migraines and figured I needed to do something, so added about 10 grams of carbs worth of strawberries (zero FODMAP food) on 4/15. Migraines got under control.

Felt like absolute, total hell for the last 8 days. I was too tired to do anything. Mood low, some hypomania and mixed states. Epic fatigue. Drank as much water as I could without inducing reflux, did okay with electrolytes (started pounding 5+ grams of salt in last few days).

This is TMI ... Didn't go the bathroom for 9 days and yesterday I had the only bowel movement I will ever remember. actually had no idea this could happen. I thought there was a good chance I was going to call 911. It took and hour and a half and, well, I passed it. Thank God.

Last night I was devastated and exhausted and figured I needed to back up and go Keto.

But today I feel halfway decent for the first time since this started and I think maybe I can continue with the same foods.

One thing I figured out was my fat was too low. I figured out my ribeyes are pretty trimmed of fat so I'm actually getting less than 70 percent of calories from fat.

I bought fat trimmings and I plan to keep pushing the fat up as high as I can go now.

So, question is, in view of the insulin resistance, do I stay the course of high fat carnivore plus strawberries (assuming my digestion stays safe)  ... Or is there a better way to do this?"
keto,"I‚Äôm not quite certain I follow your train of thought, but I‚Äôll do my best:

When a person is told to start dialysis, they‚Äôve lost 70% of their renal function. The body just can‚Äôt keep up anymore. Going on dialysis doesn‚Äôt hurt the kidneys further, it replaces them. The human body is ‚Äúlazy‚Äù so to speak - it only works as hard as it has to. So after a time on dialysis treatment the body goes ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to use my kidneys, this is getting taken care of‚Äù so it starts to shut them down further. It wants to use its resources where they‚Äôre actually needed. How quickly this happens varies from person to person, and to an extent the form of dialysis (peritoneal vs hemodialysis, home vs clinic based), but the progression is predictable- approaching dialysis, more frequent urination, after starting dialysis, it becomes less frequent and eventually stops. This is why one of the first things they look for with transplant recipients is urine production - this indicates kidney function.

As for why reduced carb might help stave off the progression of kidney disease, it likely has to do with a combination of factors, like blood pressure reduction and lowering of blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled glucose levels are damaging to small blood vessels like those that make up the vascular network in the kidneys... poor blood supply means a dying, impaired organ. This is why you see so many renal patients are diabetics and why so many diabetics deal with poor wound healing and even the risk of amputated limbs/digits.

There‚Äôs a lot of ground to cover, and it takes a lot of time to get a solid understanding of it all. It‚Äôs easy to be overwhelmed. Do keep in mind if any intervention is going to be successful, a patient needs to be an ‚Äúactive participant‚Äù and do their best to take charge of their health maintenance. A family member can help, but they can‚Äôt do it for them."
keto,"As others have said, the clothes is the most telling. Its crazy to see the sizes you can now fit into vs before"

keto,great advice thanks..
keto,I don‚Äôt think they are a bad thing in moderation. I usually have one a week. Otherwise i keep it limited to coffee with a little creamer.
keto,"i don't really understand how people can eat so much (obviously I did cuz somehow I got to 212 pounds).   But I'm not necessarily trying to severely restrict my diet either.  Like, I'll have have two whole chicken thigh's for dinner and be full... each thigh being 200 calories.  So 400 calories as a meal and I'm full. How do I eat the other 2,000 calories, ya know?"
keto,Mix cream and sugar free Torani.  I recommend their S'mores flavor.  Don't forget a little pinch of salt.  Makes it amazing.  üëå

Also, when my work and life start to feel terrible, I can cling to this one big thing I am doing for myself and that is working wonders."
keto,Many things are marketed tobe beneficial for something. That doesn't mean they all do or as well as they say they do

keto,I think they're fine and have abused them in the past with no repercussions I can remember.
keto,"Thanks for your response!

Yeah the protein is of great concern. I've read that higher protein keto is great for CKD patients and even zerocarb helping in regress CKD back one stage. Would you happen to know why starting dialysis makes such a big difference in hurting the kidneys when itt previously had such a positive effect before? My mother is suffering from high blood pressure but she has always had elevated levels of insulin, so in her case, a high fat and protein diet (zerocarb)has worked wonders for her blood pressure and metabolic dysfunction. I gu as there's a threshold you cross with th dialysis that makes protein no longer usable."
keto,Your body hasn‚Äôt processed carbs in a while so it could cause adverse reactions like the ones you mentioned. If you are going to include lentils and chickpeas I recommend introducing them slowly and in small amounts.
keto,Wow congratulations! You're going to be an absolutely stunning bride! Thanks for sharing your progress \~ well done!
keto,Take some probiaotics after each meal till you reajust to carbs.

keto,Cor.  Impressive and congratulations! Excellent husbanding too ;)
keto,"1) this really should get run by your doctor and your dialysis facility‚Äôs dietician, but....
2) I worked in a dialysis clinic. Typically renal patients are advised against high protein diets because protein is a ‚Äúlarge‚Äù structure that stresses the ability of the kidneys to filter, and can hasten the progress of kidney failure. If a patient is already on dialysis, ‚Äúpreserving‚Äù function is already no longer an option as it means 70% has already been lost, and will further be shut down the longer he‚Äôs on treatment. While dialysis is a complex issue, I‚Äôd wouldn‚Äôt worry about fluid loss as part of a keto diet as frequently renal patients worry about *retaining* fluid - fluid removal is part of what the treatment does. Additionally, he should be getting monthly labs that check electrolytes, so any deficiencies will get caught fairly soon. You should worry about a renal patient getting TOO many electrolytes, particularly potassium, as this is filtered out by normal kidney function - a buildup of potassium can be fatal. (Frequent sources of potassium are tomatoes/tomato juice, bananas, oranges, all things both diabetics and renal patients should avoid)

As for the type 2 diabetic factor - keto is amazing for diabetics because they should be limiting carbs in the first place. Given that you‚Äôre talking about a type 2 diabetic, keto done appropriately can reduce and even remove the need for medication to control blood sugars."
keto,"&gt; My diet is 100% fast food

I was being what I thought was conservative and suggesting to my dad 100 grams of carbs a day.

keto,Thanks for the tip. I just searched and it looks like there's one doctor in San Antonio who is keto friendly but she's a gastroenterologist. Worth a shot I guess.
keto,"&gt;Again, allulose IS sugar, but that aside that's exactly what real sugar would do.

It's a ""rare sugar"" that isn't metabolized by the body. It passes through to your excretory system and you piss it out.

It also blocks the enzymes that would otherwise break down the sugars that your body can actually metabolize. Unlike sugar alcohols that themselves are not metabolized and go straight to your intestines for your gut biome to process and cause you to be farty and bloaty, allulose causes the OTHER carbs and sugars you consume to pass through to your intestines undigested do the same.

&gt;You realize your blood glucose going down mean insulin went up right?

I'm a diabetic, so I'm insulin resistant. So whether or not my serum insulin increased doesn't matter to me as much as not having glucose in my blood."

Now when I get hold of some spent grains and some aelurone flour, I will be experimenting with good artisan breads. If I had found a keto bread recipe I liked by now, I would be making my own. I haven't.

I prefer home made ice cream but lack an ice cream maker at the moment. 

The only significant difference between my pre keto Mediterranean diet and my keto diet is lack of carbs really. We ate mostly whole foods and home made foods for decades."

I know from proper testing, being T2D that it impacts me as badly as sugar and the curve takes longer to drop. 

I stick with rebel ice cream. When I get an ice cream maker again I will be making my own again."

keto,"Given your medical history and your family history, I would be very surprised if you aren't insulin resistant. There's a common belief that ""thin = healthy"" and it turns out not to be the case; some people are good at converting excess glucose to fat and they put on extra weight, and others are not good at that and they remain thin but still end up with the same downsides.

Labwork will typically look at fasting glucose and HbA1c for early signs of type II. Unfortunately, neither of those are very good measures for insulin resistance. The best one I know of is HOMA-IR, which is calculated from fasting glucose and fasting insulin, but fasting insulin is rarely measured. In your case, I think your symptoms are strong enough that the lab tests don't matter very much, though my prediction is that you will have somewhat low HDL and somewhat high triglycerides. HbA1c may or may not be slightly elevated. 

The goal from a metabolic perspective is to get rid of the hyperinsulinemia that goes along with insulin resistance. To do that you need to get carbs pretty low, so my recommendation is to go all the way down to 20 grams/day and do your best to stay there for at least a few months. After a period of time on keto - and unfortunately nobody can really tell you what the time period is - you will likely be somewhat more carb tolerant and might do okay with slightly more carbs.

You might also consider one of the fasting protocols, either intermittent fasting or full fasting one day a week. Those protocols are ""bigger sticks"" metabolically."

I've generally kept away from snacks (like a handful of peanuts) and kept strickly to just eating when i'm genuinely hungry. The last two weeks this has led me to just eating one meal a day. One big-ish dinner dish. Around 800 calories.   
I was telling this to a friend recently and was met with shock. In his opinion, what I was doing was dangerous and stupid. I took this with a grain of salt as he has no experience with keto.

keto,"And they're able to intuitively stay at their current weight. Just like you can intuitively stay at yours.



There's a ""set point"" theory of weight management. I don't really believe most theories about it. But essentially the idea is our past experience and history of weight has a lot to do with where our ""set point"" is -- the weight that our body naturally falls to when we stop paying attention.

The sports we do as a kid, how well balanced our diet was as a kid. Heck, even whether we were breast fed or ate formula. Whether we emotionally ate as a kid. All kinds of things from decades ago can help craft our ""set point."" Your set point is not the same as your mother's set point -- or whoever it is you're comparing yourself to.

But that isn't to say you can't help your body find a new set point. Adding muscle -- even while staying the same weight -- increases how many calories we burn, for instance: someone 134 lbs and 20% body fat burns more calories just laying around than someone the same height, age and gender, but is 28% body fat. And that person with 20% will look leaner than the person with 28% even though they're the same height and weight.

The point to all of this is to encourage you to not give up. I bet 90% of the frustration you're feeling right now has absolutely nothing to do with something you're doing ""wrong."" Some of it is honestly beyond your control some of it is under your control. And some of it you're doing ""right"" for some people but maybe it isn't ""right"" for you. Maybe you can tweak some of those things to optimize this life to make of it what works best for YOU.

It can take time to discover what's right for you to be your happiest. You deserve to feel good about yourself."

The sardines I get have fish bones in them, I do eat organ meat when I can find it, and I just because you say ""I'm not trying to be snarky"" doesn't mean that you aren't being snarky."

keto,How do you know you haven't been losing fat for that 2 weeks?
keto,Sweet! You look awesome! I‚Äôve lost serious weight (like 250 lbs) and some days I feel like I drag skin around and I had lower body contouring done! I hate it!
keto,I‚Äôll have a look! Thank you!
keto,"Yes, I‚Äôve done that, but it says I need to eat over 2K calories a day and like 100 g of carbs."
keto,"Before I eliminated added sugar, my triglycerides were like 550. It's just so obvious what our standard diets are doing to us. It's so confusing why why why we continue to subsidize, like, the corn syrup industry or whatever the ways we downplay the dangers of sugar as a national policy. (I'm not a farm bill expert)"
keto,"Short update: rash started to reappear after vigorous exercise in the same spots (chest and lower back) but if I wash up quick and put some jojoba oil (I use it for my hair so thought to try it on the rash) and that seems to help. I also put cortisone cream on the rash before going to workout. Its barely noticeable now so hopping I can keep the rash to a minimum. 

I‚Äôll update as ketosis progresses."
keto,"High five doc!ü§ö

And yeah, I see what you mean. Perhaps when comparing leaner/""normal"" body types, that's when the BMI results be not as reliable. 

Thanks for the response!"

keto,"I'm 20 days into keto, may have been exposed to a different illness a week before my second dose, and am getting hit hard with waves of fatigue and exhaustion. Probably need to drink more water and get some electrolytes in me. It so feels like a hangover minus the nausea and stomach issues. Rolling headaches throughout the day, and a couple days ago most of the odd little sharp random muscle ""stabs"" have stopped. The muscle sensations happened in both shoulders, neck area, and one or two in other random spots.

I also had my period come back a week after it ended. Which was odd. Got a whole lot of unknowns in my case."
keto,By fasting. Fasting targets visceral fat in the trunk which is the fat making you ill.
keto,"True. No one force fed us that led us to morbid obesity. We ate the food willingly and happily without any thought of the repercussions on our bodies.

And I'll keep that in mind, that at the same vein I am the only one responsible of never doing that to myself again. Thanks for that line. 

By the way, Whenever I cross I milestone, like the 100kgs, 90kgs etc. I always tell myself ""I'm never going let myself be back to the 80s..."" I guess it's like saying goodbye to the old me."
keto,"I‚Äôve been having something similar happened to me. For me The more salt I ingest the less ability to handle water and food. To much also bloats me and gives me head aches, I hope you figure it out, let me know please"
keto,"First off, your doc missed a chance to give you high five for working on weight.  So.....high five

Bmi can sometimes be a little problematic because a powerlifter will have less fat at the same bmi than I will given my muscle mass.  But that often causes some folks to falsely refuse to believe that weight does matter and that bmi is a quick way for us to have an idea if someone would be healthier by losing weight.  So I wouldn‚Äôt say that someone with a bmi of 28 is monumentally healthier than someone at 29.  But I would absolutely say that someone at a bmi of 45 would likely be healthier if they could get to 28 in an appropriate manner. Does that make sense?

When you take a nuanced topic like that and then add all the social stigma and hurtful judgements about weight that people experience and it becomes a topic that is easy for a lot of people to avoid altogether"
keto,"Congrats Guy, we are all rooting for you!"
keto,"Amazing. Love your real life approach! Also, your hair üòç"
keto,"No I never wondered why no one ever told me. It was exceedingly clear to me that I was morbidly obese, but I was just always afraid of how difficult losing half my body weight seemed when I thought about it. It was too hard, so I just kept eating. Other people didn't say anything because they were trying to be polite. The thoughts in my head about how difficult it was were far more difficult than actually losing half my body weight was in practice. 

&gt;Maybe I'm looking for someone else to blame than myself?

It sounds like this is the case. I was the only one responsible for eating myself to morbid obesity, and in that same vein I am the only one responsible for never doing that to myself again."
keto,Nice job! Did you combine with omad or intermittent fasting also?
keto,"Hi doc, thank you for your kind words. It's difficult to find doctors (especially here in Dubai) who speak like that and look beyond the numbers.

I remember my last OB appointment (for my PCOS), my doctor mentioned that I was Obese in a very judge-y tone. And that it would be difficult for me to have children. She didn't even ask me if that was something I wanted. (I don't want any btw). I just started keto then and have lost 4kgs in 2 weeks and I told her that and she just said ""you still have a high bmi and still obese."" Maybe I was looking for kind words like ""way to go, keep doing what your doing."" Instead she just shut me down. Needless to say, I never came back. 

AnywayI wanted to ask, as a doctor, does BMI really matter? I see a lot here that it's not a good basis as the body composition is different from one person to another.  

Again I appreciate you taking the time to respond to my post. Much love üíö"
keto,Awesome work!
keto,I don't fart at all and probs go no.2 every second day!
keto,"""turn the butt faucet on"" XD I love that, it's a very excellent description of a very not-excellent thing.

I've already noticed that I have a more mild reaction to dried onion and garlic so I'm hopeful that in the end I can at least flavor things a little with my buds. 

I was keto for like two years before this all went down so I'm pretty comfortable with electrolytes, but that definitely gave me some grief when I first started lol. My doctor actually has me taking the laxative kind of magnesium currently (I want to say citrate? I'm at work on mobile so I don't have it in front of me) as a laxative so I've wound up taking that anyway, but in a much more conservative and controlled manner than if I were taking it thinking it was *just* an electrolyte lol. So no embarrassing accidents this time around."
keto,"Watch out for the hidden carbs. Check ingredients and carb count on things like condiments. In the first weeks or months, skip the replacement recipes that use alternative flours, nuts, sweeteners. Make sure any sweet tooth has been eliminated. I serve up my plate with no more than 1/3 low carb veggies."
keto,I can‚Äôt mail them but if your localish to me I don‚Äôt mind giving you some for free
keto,"Thank you for your kind words dear stranger.

By the way, do you ever wonder ""why didn't anyone tell me that I needed to lose weight?"" Or ""didn't they love me enough to find the kind words to let me know?"". Because I do. I know my sister loves me but she would never say anything, but now she sees I'm losing the weight, she's quite encouraging.  And somehow, I wish she did that back then. Maybe I'm looking for someone else to blame than myself? Although I know, no one forced me to eat all those sweets the past 2 decades. 

Anyway, you're right. I just have to focus on right now, on today. Thank you again. 

P.S. love your name. üòÜ"

keto,"Ha!  I can feel your longing for that baguette.  I am a former bread-aholic, myself and have been obese (and yo-yo dieting) for 40 years.  I've been four years on keto (down 70 pounds) and can count on one hand the number of times I've cheated.  I haven't been white-knuckling it, either.  Here's the secret:  When you truly give up the carbs, the carbs stop calling you. The fewer carbs I eat, the fewer cravings I have. I have learned I need to be sparing with keto-friendly foods that are a bit more carb-y (i.e. nuts, almond flour, berries, cheese). Load up on meats and fats until your cravings subside. Then embrace the miracle of being able to effortlessly resist the siren call of a shapely baguette."

Yeah, I see this mentioned frequently and this error is a downside of rebranding Atkins long term induction (&lt; 20 net carbs/day), which is how most people did it regardless of phases described in any version of the program, with a cute new ""~*sciencey!*~"" name. 

Doctors had diabetics restricting carbs before the isolation/discovery of insulin in the early 1900s. It's a really interesting subject (good summary/starting point for more reading [here](https://www.longdom.org/open-access/court-of-last-appeal--the-early-history-of-the-highfat-diet-for-diabetes-2155-6156-1000696.pdf), PDF warning) because one of the key physicians included excessive fasting and fat restrictions while others were getting better results and happier patients with more calories from fat than protein."

keto,I went to the doctor today for the first time after losing 75 pounds. I stripped down to my underwear in front of the entire staff and stepped on the scale. Then I flexed. No more blood pressure medication for me.
keto,"I've reached a similar stage where my friends and family, who have always been supportive, are getting more worried about me losing more weight (I still have about 8kg left to go to reach BMI 25). 

Honestly, like everyone else has said, it really depends on where you feel comfortable. Calculators and such give you standard weight ranges, but there's a lot of differences for body types and shapes. Also, the people around you don't mean badly, but you obviously look much smaller than you have for a while and it takes a while for them to adjust.

I set myself a goal based on BMI 25, but it would depend on how comfortable you feel with level of exercise + diet control and also if you enjoy the way your body feels."

keto,"Some almonds or deli meat usually help with cravings for me. I have 3 kids so the pantry is full of kid food too but I‚Äôve been doing this for almost 2 weeks and I officially feel like I‚Äôm not craving bread anymore.

Being hungry is a sure way to fail, I‚Äôve tried other ‚Äúdiets‚Äù where I‚Äôm so hungry I can‚Äôt thing of anything else but those cookies or chips!"
keto,If you eliminated a food that‚Äôs inflammatory for you (grains and sugar are for many people) then that could very well change your appearance due to less swelling and water retention. I certainly notice that for myself!
keto,"if you are concerned about your omega fatty acids, the best thing you can do is to focus on reducing your omega 6 intake.  trying to supplement on the omega 3 side of things to balance them is like trying to bail out the water in your boat with a tablespoon."

keto,"Stop eating fish oil, and this problem will go away."
keto,"Many congratulations! You are literally half the person you were 3 years ago and that's crazy to think about! How did you handle cheat meals btw. Would you go a whole day eating whatever carbs you have been craving or would it just be a one of meal or snack that kicks you out of ketosis? And how do you feel afterwards? I've been on keto for 6 months, no cheating at all. I would like to have the odd carb meal just to satisfy cravings (frozen yoghurt with chocolate sauce) but am worried I'll feel like crap afterwards as it's been so long since my body had that many carbs."
keto,"YAY!!!!!! Health gainzzzz! Congratulations to you and may your doctor begin to open his mind. It‚Äôs encouraging that he didn‚Äôt try to dispute the incredibly compelling evidence you provided. 

Great, great job!!"
keto,"I want to preface this by saying I am so sorry if this is asked a million times, here is my question. I have been measuring blood ketones since March 31st of this year, doing a keto diet. I do intermittent fasting and eat omad, bigger window on the weekends. I don't have a cheat day. I inconsistently track using chronometer app, and my protein is pretty high. My goal is 20 carbs or under. I am 48F, 143 lbs and trying so hard to lose weight, to be in my goal range of 128-132, I am 5'3 for reference. I have lost only 2 lbs. 
I feel great! I definitely am dealing with some constipation and bloating. I just really want to do this right. I ate pasta, bread, sugar baked goods before, so I really thought the weight loss would happen if I stopped those things for a month. I am fully committed to eating this way for life, I don't view this as a diet, it is my way of eating. Thank you so much for reading this and any advice you can give me. I am not really exercising,but I am teaching in person, in an elementary school, so that keeps me active all day. My blood ketones range from .7-2.6. I measure early morning and before I eat. I probably average around 1.2ish."
keto,Would taking capsules work for you? Many people choose that delivery method for this very reason.
keto,"That is wonderful  progress. check your heart  health from a doctor  and start to increase  carbs gradually  with increasing  daily activity. We are at Keto diet popularity peak , but it is not for life diet."
keto,"Nobody can tell you if you‚Äôll lose 10kg in 10 weeks - especially since you‚Äôre eating more carbs than this sub recommends (20g net / day) and more calories than recommended (use a keto calc, sedentary activity level, 20% deficit, don‚Äôt eat back exercise calories)."
keto,"Different brands. Fish oil should have a fairly neutral flavor, and it's not necessary for most people.

Why are you supplementing fish oil?"
keto,"Well, we all have our carb count choices, as long as it fits right ?!?! I'll pop a few grapes in my mouth at the end of the day if my count is particularly low. 

That's what I like best about keto. 1 rule, keep daily carbs below 20. Enjoy those sandwiches!"
keto,"^this , also love not feeling bloated or tied down to needing to eat throughout the day"
keto,r/KetoMentors
keto,"Thanks for your insight and feedback! I am 24 by the way. 


I think I can realistically follow that diet because it allows for more variation and is more convenient than 20 grams of carbs per day. Ideally I would love to lose 10KG in 10 weeks. Do you think that is a realistic goal if I follow these guidelines and exercise moderately? 

I can upload/take some pictures if that helps assess 'the situation'."
keto,"She sounds like she has a normal healthy diet.  What‚Äôs your definition of normal these days?  Fast food, processed dozen dinners?  Simply not eating overly processed breads, starchy vegetables or any of the sugars being pumped into food products, you too can have a normal, healthy diet."

keto,"Thank you so much for sharing.  This is exactly what I needed to read!  You basically validated what I was thinking would be a good plan for me (same 3 meals a day).  Plus, I already decided that I need to eat for sustenance not for pleasure.

I hit the gym 3 or 4 times a week for my Muay Thai class already, but I eat way too much to lose weight.  I will largely follow your plan, and based on past experience with keto, I expect it to work just as well, but be far easier to stick to it.  

Thanks again!"
keto,Well done! Gotta keep on keeping on!
keto,GNG is not supply driven.
keto,"Drinking was messing me up too. I was a 2 drink a night gal. I‚Äôm now a 2 drinks total on the weekend girl and nothing during the week. I know the drinks also were making me make bad snack decisions.
I‚Äôm going to see how this works!"
keto,Great idea. Could I see a photo if the chart and magnets to better understand ?
keto,"You might not have to live without them! Or you may have to. Who knows yet. 

I‚Äôd definitely try an elimination diet. Meat only for a few weeks. High protein. Add in favorite (keto) foods - slowly - one by one - every few days - and see how you react. 

Also be careful with your electrolytes. You need a ton more on keto than a carb heavy diet, but do not chug salt water and be careful which magnesium you get. Both can really turn the butt faucet on."
keto,"I think doctors get it wrong a lot of the time. The UK NHS is slowly coming round to low carb but still throw in a lot of bad advice too and even use sunflower oil and veg oil when cooking at some of the hospitals :(.

There are a lot more vitamins in veg (and even fish and meat) than fruit, and of the leafy green variety. Nice leafy salads with cherry/plum tomatoes and a little bell pepper with avocado is more nutritious than a heap of fruit. And much better for you as you're not getting all the sugar. 

Salmon is also light and nutritious, as is all oily fish."
keto,"Honestly the biggest help for me was just pick a plan and do it. I like structured workouts so even if I needed to adjust rest days or intensity levels I had a base to go off. Also I never stopped exercising, even at my heaviest I was working out for 3+ hrs a week, so I had a pretty good fitness base going in."
keto,If you check the comments I wrote out some more details in a reply!
keto,"No one has a right to your story

You don‚Äôt owe them your highest weight or your current one.   Did you lose weight? ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been trying to eat healthy and I am feeling great‚Äù.  How much weight did you lose? ‚ÄúImportant part is how much better I feel, I feel awesome, how are you doing?‚Äù

As a doc I absolutely think the number matters for a lot of health reasons at a doctors appt, but you are more than the number.  Don‚Äôt let randos in life reduce you to a number"
keto,"Dude, can't believe your 1 week challenge was almost a year ago. It gave me the kick up the butt to finally finish some models. Nice to see you here - you look amazing."
keto,"Mostly curious - I had a similar reaction (twitching, nausea, panic, water butt) to LoSalt. Cut it completely and just made sure I was getting at least 2500mg potassium from food and all was good. 

Regular salt i take throughout the day no problem though. I put a pinch in most glasses of water (as long as I‚Äôm not chugging it) with a squeeze of lemon and it keeps me feeling tiptop. 

And magnesium (natural calm) I just take at night."
keto,"I did keto years ago with great results, and I'm reading this forum to learn more in preparation to start up again this weekend.

When I was in ketosis, I noticed that my farts/feces didn't have any smell.  I also had very little gas, just the opposite of what you are experiencing.  My guess i something doesn't agree with your stomach and you need to isolate and remove it from your diet."
keto,"Yeah I just read about the 3-4 week water bump as you sort of reset your glycerol in your muscles. Maybe this is it. I was dieting for longer than that, but maybe I just never hit this hard so it never happened. Annoyingly this is meant to be when your keto goes on fully proper, annnnd I have to come off keto this weekend because I'm going to a mates birthday, its my girlfriends birthday, and I'll be places I can't really be veg keto, especially with all restaurants closed....

Oh well. Supposedly I'm still losing fat semi linearly, it's just the measurements that are fluxxing"
keto,"Yeah I have been at or under 1200 for ages which is why I'm so frustrated lol. Like I get stalls, but also, this is mad. I'm supposedly on a 1000kcal deficit per day haha

I mean I'm guessing my metabolism has gone to fuck all. But I feel fine. God knows. Apparently people say this is normal, I'm just confused from a biological standpoint."
keto,"Yes from plain salt. Potassium was mostly dietary (spinach, coconut water, wheatgrass, avocados) but then I added lo salt to meet the target or try to fix symptoms. I just got No salt delivered yesterday so haven‚Äôt experimented with that much yet! Do you think I need more than the dietary potassium?"
keto,Thank you very much!
keto,"You're doing great, recognize that.  I was about the same stats as you and I'll tell you that everyone who looked at me could instantaneously tell I had over 100lbs to lose, they just never said anything.  The only person who ever told me to lose weight (besides that little voice in my head every single day) was the doctor, so I just stopped going to the doctor.  Now I just had the pleasure of visiting the doctor again after my visit last January when I was quite a bit heavier, and that same doctor just about fell off his damn chair in shock at how great I look.  So try not to invest too much in those stories in your head about what might be in the future.  Focus on right now, remain calm and keto on."
keto,"Are the twitching and booty rumbles from just plain table salt?

Also how are you getting the 2800mg potassium? Is that just from food or are you supplementing?"

keto,Great job!!
keto,"Reposting from FreedomManOfGlory (user):

And as for keto: figure out how to make things work. If keto ""doesn't work"" for someone it's pretty much always due to them doing something wrong or not ideally. I've seen countless people here make this claim over the past years and it always seems to come down to this. There is no person for whom this diet doesn't work as far as I'm aware. But feel free to prove me wrong, after you've done all the research and have tried to follow the diet optimally for some time. Your electrolyte issue could have been fixed very easily. You certainly didn't need to go back to a standard diet for that. And it certainly would have been a good idea to look into why exactly you might have ended up low on electrolytes. I generally only need to salt my food during summer when I'm sweating a lot. The rest of the year I've been fine without using any salt at all and nowadays I only salt my food a bit for the taste. Beyond the first few weeks and outside of summer or any situation where you sweat a lot you should not normally run low on electrolytes. While sweating will make you run out just as well on a standard diet."
keto,"Are you eating more veg than usual? My partner only ate a little veg with dinner before he moved in with me, and half of that was potatoes. I love lots of veg with my meals and now he's eating it, he never stops trumping :(. It's worse on days we have a big stir fry etc."
keto,"Weight loss isn‚Äôt linear - even with a constant caloric deficit there will be weeks you lose a lot, weeks you lose a little, weeks you lose nothing and weeks you gain a bit. 

Your body is not a simple physics equation. There are hormones which cause water retention (yes even for guys), working out causes water retention, how much poo and pee is in the chamber, how hydrated you are, etc. that all effect the number on the scale.

There‚Äôs also an INSANELY common ‚Äústall‚Äù around week 3/4. Idk the sciencey reasons, but I see it posted here alll the time. It‚Äôs normal. And it won‚Äôt be your only one.

Focus on what you can control (what goes in your body) and not what you can‚Äôt (your body‚Äôs exact weight). As long as you‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre eating at a caloric deficit just keep calm and keto on - the weight will come off :)."
keto,It took about 4-6 weeks before I no longer felt that constant pull towards sugar.   I have been on keto now since Aug 2018.  I no longer have the desire to eat anything sugary.  I will overdo it on other foods at times.  The desire to keep eating is still there but only on occasions when I am stressed or super tired.  However I never get the desire for sugar.   Keep going!  It‚Äôs worth it!
keto,"I guessed your age, but here are the macros I got for you using 50g carbs and the maximum protein given you are quite active, with a 20% deficit using this calculator [https://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/](https://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/) (set to sedentary as I am a firm believer in not eating back exercise calories if your goal is weight loss):

 **1955kcal Daily Calorie Intake**

**50g Carbs** (10%, 200 kcal)

**178g Protein** (36%, 712 kcal)

**116g Fat** (54%, 1043 kcal)

Eating 50g carbs a day, on your workout days you *may* be in ketosis part of the time. You may anyway on those macros, but under 20g **net** carbs a day is the only way to guarantee that you will be in ketosis. 

However if you feel no adverse affects (ie cravings and increased appetite) on 50g carbs then you should be able to stick with a deficit and lose the weight."

keto,"Thank you! And I appreciate you sharing a bit of your story here. 
I‚Äôm just barely 5 feet which is why I‚Äôm looking to get to 125, and then I would transition to just maintenance since I wouldn‚Äôt want to lose anymore than that. It‚Äôs striking to see the BMI chart and according to that, I‚Äôm on the higher end of being overweight. That being said, I wouldn‚Äôt want to be at the weight it recommends for me either which is about 100. My sister sits at the recommended weight and is also 5 feet. My mom, also 5 feet, weighs 130. I could definitely see how the numbers could look jarring though. I do agree that shooting for whats healthy and maintainable should be the goal and I try to focus on that as well. Reaching a numerical goal is symbolic for me because I feel like I always felt like it was off limits to me. I was careful to pick a number that would still be healthy for me. As an adult, I‚Äôm still traumatized by the bullying by my own family and my mom putting me on diets as a child. Keto gave me tools to get healthier in a way that made me happy and nothing has ever worked that way for me."

keto,"one of my favorites for lunch is egg salad and bacon on romaine lettuce. I use pre cooked bacon from samsclub not the same at all as fresh bacon, but it's fast and can be eaten out of the packaging. Isopure zero carb protein is good I mix it with vanilla almond milk."
keto,"Thank you! 
I actually tried just calorie counting with my SO when quarantining first started because he wanted to do it together and I was miserable! I missed keto structure so badly! 
IF will definitely be making a comeback for me. I had the most progress while doing IF and OMAD. It‚Äôs definitely a challenge making components specific for me and for my SO and daughter. Challenging but not impossible and someone else commented and suggested meal planning which I 100% plan to adopt again. All the support, suggestions and comments have really got me feeling more motivated to be more focused and prioritizing this. Thank you!"
keto,"Thank you! I‚Äôve pretty much just been eating at maintenance and I‚Äôm at that point where I need to transition back to deficit. I love the idea of meal planning and keeping things simple, sticking to what‚Äôs worked for me before. In keto, it‚Äôs really easy to get lost in modifications when sticking to the basics is the best route. Simple is actually what I‚Äôm needing. I appreciate you sharing your stories with me because it‚Äôs really helping me to get back into the right mindset."
keto,"I‚Äôll have to check them out! A vacuum sealer sounds smart too, I‚Äôll have to look into that. I was asking about sams club because that‚Äôs the other large wholesale warehouse in my area that I have a membership to, don‚Äôt know if they are arguably the same as far as quality of meat"
keto,That‚Äôs a great tip! Red meat does get expensive and I‚Äôve never tried mackerel but I‚Äôd be willing to! Thank you
keto,"I'm impressed you managed to find nutritional info! I find it an utter nightmare to find out the carb count in a lot of beers, so I stick to ones that advertise being low-carb. (For me in Australia, that's goes: Bighead, Pure Blonde and Hahn Superdry)"
keto,I break my 16:8 fast with two jumbo hard boiled eggs with salt or Everything Bagel seasoning.
keto,"Thank you! I‚Äôm more so frustrated these days because the motivation I had to keep losing isn‚Äôt as strong as it was, likely because I‚Äôve lost a lot already and pretty close to my goal weight. This is a lifestyle change for me. I‚Äôve tried lots of different ‚Äúdiets‚Äù and nothing keeps me happy and interested the way keto does. I don‚Äôt feel deprived, I‚Äôm energized and I feel in control. The number is personal for me but it would only drive me to maintain all my hard work and dedication to myself. Thanks so much for your support!"
keto,"Too bad. If you happen to be in Indiana, let me know. I have 7 hen ducks and they‚Äôre all laying. I have so many I have to fry them all up and give them to my dogs so they don‚Äôt go to waste. I can never go back to chicken eggs."
keto,"Did you ever figure this out? I have a similar problem, and it seems to happen to me when I supplement salt. But now I cut back salt and am fatigued :/"
keto,"Thank you!!
And you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs a matter of changing the mindset and pushing through, something I‚Äôve done a lot of before. Instead of eating at a deficit, I‚Äôve just been maintaining lately and even though I‚Äôm not gaining, it doesn‚Äôt stop me from feeling like nothing is happening. I‚Äôve gotta prioritize this just like I‚Äôve done before and get over the hump. I have no plans on stopping after I reach 125, I‚Äôm just going to switch to maintenance since I wouldn‚Äôt be looking to lose anymore. Thanks for the support!"
keto,"Red meat can get expensive so although I know you didn‚Äôt ask, I get a lot of quality fats, omega 3 fatty acids and protein from canned mackerel. Very cheap and one of the best foods you can eat for nutritional density!"
keto,Thanks for your input... I'm still making adjustments and learning about my nutritional needs... I hope to eventually understand what to do. ;)
keto,"Breakfast was pretty easy- I usually make some concoction of eggs, bacon, cheese. My favorite is making an omelet with those and maybe some veggie mixed in. For snacks, I like eating cheese sticks, salami, pork rinds, jerky, etc. Dinner is usually some kind of meat with a veggie. If I want a little something sweet I just have a few strawberries or small piece of dark chocolate."
keto,That sounds great
keto,"I get 5 packs of NY strip from Costco for 10.99 / lb. Eat one steak right away, keep a couple more fresh in the fridge to consume soon, and freeze the rest.  I got a vacuum sealer from Costco that keeps the frozen steaks in good shape. The Costco steaks are thicker than supermarket steaks."
keto,"I'm not sure what the mechanism is, but one of the links in the comment that I posted mentioned a reduction in both obesity and hepatic steatosis (aka fatty liver)."
keto,Thank you for the advice. I'm prepared for the weight loss to slow down due to the water weight and also how it takes longer the more weight you lose. But thanks for the encouragement!
keto,"Yeah, when I eventually decide to get off it I'm not going cold turkey. More like just a highball I nurse that won't get me where I want to be, but will stave off the negative effects."
keto,"I do have a sams club membership that I haven‚Äôt used in a while, never bought meat from there - do you think it would be just as good? Or is Costco comparably better?"
keto,"Not yet.  Have to find some first.  As you stated, they can be hard to get a hold of.  I had a lead on some last spring but the farmer I was going to buy from had his little flock decimated by a neighbor's dog.  Ducks aren't a big thing around here."
keto,"Costco has the best price / quality near me. If you happen to have a business Costco nearby I highly recommend going there for meat. It's basically restaurant supply with crazy good prices for meat, but the meat is less processed. They sell whole primals at mine, and whole hogs too. They also sell normal common cuts if you would rather not break it down yourself."
keto,"a lot of that can be water weight. Carbs help with water retention and without the carbs your body has much less water and weighs less. you need to up the water intake to stay hydrated and the amount of electrolytes you take it, hydration and electrolytes are essential for keto

Im telling you this now so you arent disappointed and confused if your weight-loss slows down or when you gain weight back if you get off keto

Its sounds like you are doing a good job, so keep up the good work."
keto,Ketochow in the morning.
keto,R/ketochow enough said.
keto,The coconut mct oil in coffee is my jam.
keto,"why do you keep yelling? all caps and bold is the internet equivalent of getting close and screaming in my face.

he does not need to have carbs. however, he will notice a dip in energy/stamina until he's fully keto adapted which can take 4-8 weeks. If he's not willing to deal with that, he might as well just it normal food. But realistically, he should be the one dealing with this. if he doesn't want to eat keto you can't force him. if he wants to load up on frankenfoods, he's going to have a hard time."
keto,"I really love  ground turkey, feta omelette with some spring onions, keeps me full!"
keto,Recipe?
keto,"Just remember, alcohol is one of the only drugs you can die withdrawing from.  Take that shit seriously!"
keto,Which was it? They make a lotta IPAsüòÇ
keto,"How is it unimportant if you aren't diabetic? It tells you when you have consumed carbs (oversimplification obviously), and keto is about low carb intake. Your argument doesn't make any sense. Also glucose isn't that complicated and you don't need a doctor or a prescription to test your blood sugar. There is plenty of information online to fully understand how blood sugar works without needing to have a docot rexplain it."
keto,Can you talk about how some of your keto meals looked like
keto,have you made good keto cupcakes before?
keto,"Most MDs are pretty useless for nutrition. But there are definitely some MDs out there at least on podcasts or writing books is what I meant. The diet doctor dude seems really smart and he's low key.

I'm getting ready to tell a doc I am going full carnivore. This should be interesting. I actually did carnivore for 4 days but I had to pull back and add some strawberries because it was too much all at once and the heavy keto flu was giving me migraines."
keto,I find aldi is really good for red meat!
keto,"Homemade chia seed pudding made with coconut milk, whipping cream, pinch of salt, cinnamon, vanilla extract. The chia helps with keeping you regular too üí©"
keto,"Awesome, thank you!"
keto,"I'm feeding almost six month old twins. We already supplement with formula because there isn't enough time in the day to feed them, pump, play with my two year old, play with my kelpie, and sleep. I'm ready to start losing weight. I gained a lot due to not being able to move much while I was pregnant, plus two babies. I'll be staying closer to 2100 calories, and just seeing how it goes. I'm starting IF this week to see how I feel and then low carb the week after before going towards keto. While watching my milk supply the whole time. At least the boys will let me know if it's not enough."
keto,"Two hard boiled eggs with a bit of Sriracha Mayo on each half, with a half a strip of bacon crumbled up between them. Hits like a brick and gives a strange sensation of fullness."
keto,Have you ever tried duck eggs? A lot of people who are intolerant to chicken eggs can eat duck eggs. They‚Äôre yummier and have more nutrients too! They can be hard to get a hold of sometimes but try farmers markets.
keto,I make nut and seed crackers that are so delicious everytime I eat them I say: I can do Keto forever... (it's been one month)
keto,"\*Young ones\*. Old school MDs are stubborn as f\*\*k. And yes and no, MDs today advocate Keto for a short amount of time and not accept it as a lifestyle. They will also tell you that it isn't sustainable because Keto doesn't fulfill your vitamin needs...bull\*\*\*\*."
keto,"You can make a kick-ass Alfredo sauce with butter, heavy wipping cream, and parmesan cheese.

Now really you don't need noodles, just something that grabs the sauce.  I like to cook broccoli in the Alfredo sauce.

I wouldn't say it's anywhere near a daily meal.  We do a slow cook roast once a week."
keto,Also called Nosalt or you can buy cream of tartar as well. Both should be easily found.
keto,"I use it as my primary cooking oil. I‚Äôve found there‚Äôs no savory food that it doesn‚Äôt pair well with and with the price of olive oil these days, it‚Äôs a no brainer."
keto,"Corona Premier is only 2.6 carbs per bottle and much more flavorful than Michelob Ultra.
As an avid beer drinker prior to going Keto, it makes it much easier to handle not being able to enjoy craft brews while on this diet."
keto,"I never knew that! There are cuts I avoid because of that exact reason. I will look into this, thanks!"
keto,"Another trick to avoid dry turkey burgers is to add some finely chopped mushrooms to your burger meat. You can lightly saut√© with oil, onion, garlic, s-n-p or just put the shrooms in raw. Adds a ton of juiciness"
keto,"If he'd be receptive to it, look up some videos by Dr. Jason Fung. He has some great analogies for how the body derives energy from carbs vs. fat. Might be a lightbulb moment for him. 

I'd say that if he wants keto versions of things like bread and such, don't worry about it. Just pack a ton of satisfying meat, cheese, and such in between those slices of bread. 

Stay supportive! My husband decided to join me on my keto journey, and he's a new man because of it! I held his hand a bit, because I'm the one interested in doing the homework, reading big fat books, and etc. I just share the important highlights that are relevant to him. 

Oh, and if you haven't already, check out the ""Fat Fiction"" documentary. That was something my husband enjoyed."
keto,apparently can find it locally
keto,"That's garbage.

Skin tone is caused by pigmentation. Yes, even in conditions of hyperpigmentation like acanthosis nigricans."
keto,You're on the right path.  Stick with it.
keto,"Does allulose do something to fructose so that it is no longer metabolized in the liver?  That is the only way we can process fructose, unless this research suggests otherwise.  And that fact, more than blood glucose, would be more of a concern to me if I were dealing with NAFL."
keto,"Okay so looks like in the first picture you've got acanthosis nigricans (AN) and confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CARP).

The AN is the dark solid areas on your neck (also can be seen in the arm pits and inner thighs, but I can't see those in the pic). The skin also tend to be thick and velvety.

The CARP is the mottled and patchy dark stuff across your chest. Those are probaby also thick, but feel more like dry skin and may be scaley.

Do you have PCOS by any chance?

Both are associated with PCOS (yes, due to inslin resistance).

I also had both. 

I had CARP between my breasts, and on the sides of my neck going up behind my ears. It cleared up with in a couple months of doing keto. I didn't think to take any photos unfortunately. However, I was amazed. It had been a long time since the skin on my chest had been so clear and supple feeling.

I still have a bit of AN on my neck and thighs. The neck has lightened some though."
keto,Steak with butter and zucchini.
keto,"These are the links to the studies with some key excerpts:

[https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnsv/54/6/54\_6\_511/\_pdf/-char/en](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnsv/54/6/54_6_511/_pdf/-char/en)

&gt;An animal study on the suppression of increase in plasma glucose concentration with d-psicose (i.e. allulose) found significant drops in plasma glucose concentration when maltose and sucrose were used as substrates, but no significant drops when glucose and soluble starch were used as substrates (5).

The bad news is that allulose won't reduce BG if you're going to eat potato chips, but it may work if you eat something containing sugar. (I have no idea what foods contain maltose. LOL)

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19794929/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19794929/)

&gt;Male Wistar rats (6 months old) were administrated 2 g/kg of sucrose, maltose or soluble starch together with 0.2 g/kg of d-psicose or d-fructose. The d-psicose significantly inhibited the increment of plasma glucose concentration induced by sucrose or maltose. The starch-induced glycemic response tended to be suppressed by d-psicose, however the suppression was not significant. 

This paper is likely related to the study in the previous link, and it pretty much draws the same conclusion: allulose works when consuming sucrose or maltose but not starches.

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26297965/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26297965/)

&gt;Human trials showed that D-allulose attenuates postprandial glucose levels in healthy subjects and in borderline diabetic subjects. The anti-hyperlipidemic effect of D-allulose, combined with its anti-inflammatory actions on adipocytes, is beneficial for the prevention of both obesity and atherosclerosis and is accompanied by improvements in insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. 

Why the hell is this not common knowledge in diabetes community?

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7071329/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7071329/)

&gt;In the present study, D-allulose supplementation was markedly effective in protecting the host against HFD-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis. It is plausible that these pathologies are mediated by the alteration of the gut microbiome profile and enhanced energy expenditure. Our findings suggest that D-allulose can exert its biological effects through modulating the gut microbiome. 

In the ""Discussion"" section, this paper points out the link between fructose consumption and fatty liver and insulin resistance, so I'm not sure why they're characterizing these cases as ""HFD-induced"". Regardless, the findings do show that allulose is effective against obesity and fatty liver. I'm not sure why they're reluctant to connect the dots and just say it's fructose (and its disaccharide sucrose) that was the actual cause of the fatty liver and obesity rather than a high-fat diet.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6315886/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6315886/)

&gt;Thus, the maximum single dose for the occasional ingestion of D-allulose was 0.4 g/kg¬∑BW (about 25.43 g); this indicates that an individual with a body weight of 60 kg can consume a maximum of 24 g of D-allulose. 

I'm not sure how much that is in terms of volume, but somewhere between 2 and 3 tablespoons will get me running to the can within 10 minutes. No joke, it's that fast! So use allulose sparingly."
keto,"I know you want fast results, but the main reason a diet fails is if you are continually hungry,  so eating too little makes that more likely.  Settle for slower, more steady results by following a sustainable amount of food."
keto,Fat is not a goal! Protein is a goal and carbs are a limit. Don‚Äôt stress over trying to get X amount of fat.
keto,"&gt;However, if I drink any alcohol (spirits only: Vodka, Gin, etc.), that stuff is so calorically dense, if I tracked those calories as well... I'd shoot past my caloric goal for the day after a couple of sips.

To state the obvious, you can either drink less or eat less to offset the calories that you drink.

There's really no other answer than that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Now, I've heard from multiple resources that ethanol is so taxing on the system to dismantle and digest that it actually requires more calories to process than it contains.

What sources?"
keto,"Check out the roast prices for ribs and NY strip.  They are often cheaper per lb than the steaks and you can simply cut them up yourself.


Also consider getting a sous vide circulator.  Through the alchemy of cooking under a vacuum at a steady temperature for longer periods, you can make tougher and cheaper cuts more tender without overlooking them.  And cheaper cuts are often a trade off between flavor and tenderness - with this method you can have both.  And, yes, there is a subreddit for sous vide :)"
keto,"It must go directly to reddit.     
   
We have nothing in modmail from you.  So, just send me a PM and I'll get it unlocked pretty darn quickly."
keto,Cauliflower ‚Äúmac‚Äù and cheese (with optional chorizo and a side salad) is always good to have on hand.
keto,"I responded to the automod message.

I'll pm you the link to the post."
keto,Some of the protein bars have a good amount of fat. One of my favorite Atkins bars (Peanut Butter Protein Wafer Crisp) has 15g of fat (along with 10g protein and only 3g net carbs). These damn things taste just like those Nabisco Nutter Butter Wafers (the rectangular shaped wafer pillows--not the peanut-shaped sandwich cookies).
keto,"How old is the baby you're breastfeeding? I started keto on March 1 when my baby was 10 months old. I was also worried about my supply because my baby is exclusively breastfed and I really wanted to make sure I could make it to at least a year of breastfeeding. I didn't notice any change in my supply, but I'm also not doing a huge calorie deficit (I eat around 1800 calories/day and I'm losing weight consistently) and that was intentional to make sure my body wouldn't freak out and stop producing. Personally, I wouldn't start keto until my baby was at least 6 months old and starting to eat some solids. Closer to 8 or 9 months when they are really eating solids well would be even better."
keto,"How.  There is nothing from you in mod mail.   
       
Send me a PM instead.  I get those notifications directly on my phone.   
         
We tell automod what words to hold up a post.  Your stuff is getting caught up by reddit's system.

keto,Amazing üëèüëèüëè
keto,"I'm currently struggling with reflux.

Don't have a diagnosis yet, but going to see a GI soon.

I haven't broken keto, but I have had to change what I eat.

Basically I have to cut out a lot of spice and most anything acidic.

So basically, I'm now doing keto without the flavor. üòí

Reflux fucking sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: Also have PCOS, so just CICO is not an option for me because carby food gives me horrendous sugar cravings."
keto,"They're not, Amazon is just inflated. Stores sell it for like 6-7 Dollars."
keto,"I agree, the ratio bars are terrible.  I've heard really good things about the yogurt cups though.

The big bag of Highkey cookies is like $12, which is a much better deal than the three bags you get online.  The only downside is now you have a giant bag of cookies, so having strong willpower is a must."
keto,I did message. Immediately.
keto,How about extra fat?
keto,"You can get one of those rotisserie chickens from Costco and pre-slice the meat or make chicken salad for quick future meals.

Or get one of those 8-packs of preformed burger patties from the grocery store and fry/grill them all, so you can nuke them whenever you want to eat.

I have all kinds of proteins like this ready to go. I either have them on keto bread, low carb tortillas, or low carb pitas.

For vegetables, I always keep a huge jar of giardianiera or steam a huge bag of broccoli or cauliflower and keep in the fridge. 

I always have a tub of jalapeno artichoke dip in the fridge to have with the broccoli or cauliflower.

Whenever I want extra protein I eat a keto protein bar as a dessert."
keto,"That‚Äôs amazing, thank you for sharing! Will look into that."
keto,"[amazon.ca](https://amazon.ca) has ""NoSalt""

It's quite expensive though (Amazon US has it much cheaper!)

There is something else which is slightly cheaper

[https://www.amazon.ca/Windsor-Iodized-Salt-Free-Substitute/dp/B07H1LH8CG](https://www.amazon.ca/Windsor-Iodized-Salt-Free-Substitute/dp/B07H1LH8CG)

keto,"Aside from lower fat content, ground turkey and ground beef are pretty comparable when you use cuts with similar fat contents.  Beef has more zinc, B12 and iron, but is also higher in saturated fat.  Turkey has comparable protein and is higher in the other b vitamins vital to metabolism.  
So, because turkey is generally lower fat you may want to add healthy fat to increase satiety, but otherwise if you're not using it as your sole protein source for a long time, but as an addition, it's a comparable meat as far as quality is concerned and you shouldn't end up lacking in vital nutrients by adding it to your diet."
keto,"great information, thank you!"
keto,Congrats!
keto,"I hate to be THAT person but why is it up to you to solve this problem for him?

This kind of goes beyond being supportive of your partner, it's more like he's asking you to do magic for him.

It's beyond just wanting items like keto bread, from what you say it sounds like he doesn't even believe keto will work for him but he wants you to change that?

You can't change his mind for him."
keto,Congrats!!!!
keto,It certainly wasn't a meal but when I've tested other foods as experiments it has increased by maybe 10 points. The last time I had a 115-120 reading was after eating something with maltitol. Every body is different! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

keto,"Local farm. 5$/lb for ground beef, 14$/lb for ribeye and strips"
keto,"it resets your homeostasis state, duh. also your midichlorians go through the roof"
keto,"Yep. It has a higher concentration of potassium, and less sodium chloride than sea salt or regular table salt. Might not be exactly what you are looking for but works in a pinch, pun intended."
keto,Good information improves the odds of good decisions.  Hope you find the resolution you want
keto,Thanks.
keto,"Right, got it. Thank you."
keto,If I eat sugary things I get severe cramping
keto,I wouldn‚Äôt do more than a 20% deficit
keto,That‚Äôs because the calorie deficit is what causes fat loss. No calorie deficit = you will lose the water weight of glycogen depletion and nothing else.
keto,Ok thank you. Might have to make an effort to add salt to my food now. Would that stop the cravings and tiredness?
keto,"See my reply. I know going off of carbs will be hard and I won't focus on calories when starting. I meant more in the future, is 1396 cals unsustainable, should I up them?"
keto,No and protein timing doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre not a pro athlete either.
keto,"Thanks! I'm a very long time lurker, so I've noticed that fat is considered a lever. 

However, I don't want to be crash dieting, so I'm not very sure about the calories. Do you think they are too low?"
keto,"This is good advice I don‚Äôt see often on this sub... there is more focus on calorie deficit on this keto sub than elsewhere on the internet by a mile. Cutting carbs is a shock to the system and cutting calories at the same time out of the gate seems like a recipe for fatigue and feels almost more like a crash diet. So many posters seems to be preaching ‚Äúcut carbs, cut calories, watch your fat (?!?!) and fast all the time!‚Äù Maybe there‚Äôs truth to all of it, but doing all that at the same time that you first go off carbs seems insane."
keto,Blaze Pizza does a cauliflower crust pizza.
keto,"Not liking salt doesnt mean your body doesnt need it. Your body is telling you it needs more electrolytes, the only way to remedy that is to replenish them."
keto,"I bought the cinnamon and chocolate ones (couldn‚Äôt find peanut butter). My main reason for buying them was to satisfy crunch cravings - which these do perfectly well. To me the flavor is a little bland, but not horrible. My biggest dislike about the product is that I feel hungry shortly after eating it, so it makes me question whether or not the carbs are really worth it. But it‚Äôs definitely a product I keep in my pantry just in case."
keto,"Great job! Today is also day 100 for me!

I track my weight in a weird way. I only put it in my app if it goes down. So I might go a week or so without logging my weight but it keeps me motivated to stay on track üòÑ"
keto,"Hi, thank you. Yeah, in the beginning I will definitely not pay much attention to my calories, but focus on feeling satisfied and not craving - currently fucking loving carbs, lol. Do you think I should up my calories in the long run, tho?"
keto,I tried the chocolate ones and they were terrible! Super dry even with milk. It was like chewing balls of sawdust.
keto,"I once woke up mad at myself and brushing non-existant potato chip crumbs out of my bed.  

Now that was a vivid dream."
keto,"Carbs are a limit, protein is a goal, fat and calories are so you don't feel hungry. You don't have to aim for either of those, if you're low you will feel hungry."
keto,"Ooo, that‚Äôs a good idea. I never thought to use them as a rice Krispy substitute."
keto,"This sounds like it might be a case for ""drop by and ask them"".  They may not advertise their low carb option, and it may not be in the app or the online menu, but that doesn't mean it's not there or even a ""standard"" thing for them.  And if it's not, maybe they would consider it if you asked.  If you don't ask the answer is always no."
keto,"Amen! I totally get you. What I have done is ask for extra, extra cheese when ordering out. This at least makes it easier to pull all the toppings off of the crust. üòÅüòùüëçüèº"
keto,Thinking piss strips matter makes you an idiot who didn‚Äôt read the FAQ so there‚Äôs no way I care about your opinion of my reply.
keto,"I would start at no more than a 20% deficit.  Beyond that, your absolute priority right now is to break the carb addiction cycle.  So your only absolute goal THIS WEEK is less than 20g NC.  If you are hungry, craving, your body is BEGGING for carbs, eat Protein or Fat.  Protein is best, but if you need some fat bombs for right now, use them.  Even if it means you are eating 1500 or 1700 calories.  Your body will tell you ANYTHING it thinks you will listen to as to why you MUST give it carbs.  Don't listen."
keto,Definitely. I used to get super hungry and binge. I think a lot of it is that my blood sugar isn‚Äôt such a roller coaster ang more!
keto,Yeah I know I can always make my own but sometimes there‚Äôs nights where I don‚Äôt feel like cooking :P great recommendation!
keto,Unfortunately there hasn‚Äôt been a Cici‚Äôs in my area in a very long time üò≠
keto,Ooooo def gonna look into that!
keto,"Have you ever made a crustless pizza? 

Take a medium size or small nonstick frying pan.  Hit it with some nonstick spray. Get the pan up to about medium heat. Put thick, shaved mozzarella directly into the pan. You can experiment with the thickness but on average I use about 3/4 of a bag easily. Sliced mushrooms and layer them on top. If you put pepperoni in it‚Äôll be a little greasy so you want to blot it with a paper towel as it cooks. Olives and bacon bits work too. 

The mozzarella will crust up, much like it does on top of lasagna, and with a spatula you can coax it out of the pan after you see the edges are turning brown.   It will have the texture of a very thin slice of New York style pizza.

That does it for me. I‚Äôm usually craving the cheese and the saltiness of pizza. A slice of this dipped in blue cheese dressing and I‚Äôm good to goüëçüèº"
keto,I keep starting then I get Taco Bell. Damn it.
keto,"My dh and I are still working toward achieving consistent keto. We started this road learning about [Dr. Cate Shanahan](https://drcate.com) and reading her books. Our initial focus was less on keto and more on incorporating high-nutrition foods, eliminating most sugars, and becoming fat-burners, rather than sugar-burners. What we learned from her led us to learning about the keto diet. Coincidentally (cosmically?), I'd encountered the keto diet decades earlier in reference to treating children with intractable epilepsy. I was familiar with the diet, but not in this context--the context of healthy fuel for the body/brain. 

My dh and I started working towards fat-burning in our bodies. The day I realized I was no longer feeling those debilitating hypoglycemic responses, driving me to eat or pay the price, was a liberating day for me. I immediately started practicing intermittent fasting every day. My 16 hours fasting 8 hours eating (16:8) quickly moved to 20:4 fasts. Very soon after that, I went almost 48 hours fasting one weekend and felt incredible. My hunger pains would come and go occasionally, but without all the dire consequences that accompanied the hunger. The longer I've been practicing intermittent fasting, the less I have problems with hunger signals, too.  I generally start my long fast midday on Friday and end at midday on Sunday. I feel so good after that long fast.

I deal with ME/CFS and I've noticed that I have a bit more energy to work with every day. At the very least I'm able to keep going where before I couldn't. I often feel better fasting than I do eating. I'm also losing weight which is a huge bonus with my disease. I'm feeling better in so many ways with this diet/lifestyle. 

One of the best parts of this lifestyle is losing that addiction to carbs/sugars. Our bodies have so many mechanisms in place that it triggers when it thinks it's being deprived of those fuel sources. When you can start fueling yourself with fats, you find a limitless source of fuel for your body. Generating ketones provides an even better fuel source for your brain. Sugars are inflammatory. The body also stores only a small amount of sugars that can be utilized for energy, which requires constant replacement. This means that you are more energy-secure when you walk away from high carb dependency and focus on eating foods that provide ample nutrients and an adjustable source of fat for your body to utilize in a healthier way. For those of us (I mean me) with too much fat, we limit our fat intake and depend on using our own body's sources.

I think that if you can take the steps to wean your body away from carbs, and move towards fat-burning,  you will find it easier to deal with your urges. If much of your problem comes from a mental/emotional source, you will need to reach out for help in other ways, but this diet/lifestyle will still give you an advantage and will help protect your body. I had to learn to identify when I was eating for emotional reasons, and when I was eating because I was prediabetic and my body was screaming for more sugar. It helped me immensely in my efforts to control what I eat. I'm in a much happier place in my life. I'm looking forward to gaining my slender figure again, and my body feeling the relief that comes with carrying less poundage

Good luck in your journey. I hope you find a happy place in your life where food is concerned."
keto,"But you‚Äôd have to drink almond milk or something? Blech. I love ice cold milk too much to eat cereal without it. 

Man I really miss milk."
keto,"Hi, I started keto on Monday so on day 5. I was doing well and feeling okay although tired. But today something in me just craved chocolate and I ended up grabbing a packet of crisps and some crepes..
I feel awful  and want to bounce back as I even lost 1.9kg during those days. 

How can I up my energy baring in mind i am currently fasting as it‚Äôs Ramadan so I eat at around 3-4am and then at sunset. I try not to eat a lot during the time inbetween sunset and sunrise. I don‚Äôt like a lot of salt on my food in general as I‚Äôm seeing a lot of comments around that"
keto,Nice job!  Stay strong!
keto,Fair enough. I definitely notice a difference between when I'm taking supplements and not. Was just hoping that it could end at some point but that seems less likely with each commenters response and own experience.
keto,"I would recommend avoiding any packaged food. Also, avoiding the taste of sweetness."
keto,I just went for lab work this morning! I got my own hypothesis but I thought Id better leave it up to health professionals.
keto,Thank you for sharing your chart!!! It looks awfully familiar!!!
keto,"It helped me. I had constant hunger: leptin resistance.... and ate constantly.... eventually I had issues with my gallbladder cuz it couldn‚Äôt keep up with all the eating...
Thought it was a gluten sensitivity.... so went off gluten for a while. 
Did keto and it fixed everything: binge eating, gallbladder, constant hunger. I can even eat gluten again
Definitely worth a go"
keto,A physician can draw labs to give you objective information on if supplements are indicated
keto,Thank you I will check him out tonight. I have had my cortisol levels checked fasting and at night. Both came back normal.
keto,"YMMV, personally have done 1-2 day fasts and always found it led to me quitting / giving up. I found success just doing OMAD. When its time to eat make sure you are making good choices and make sure you are satisfied after your meal. Then you're not stuck thinking about food the rest of the time. 

^ This works for me but ultimately you need to experiment around. Find something you can stick with."
keto,"Most likely your body is functioning like it doesn't have one because the bile can't get out. That happened to me. 

Good news is it might actually be less bad then once it's out. 

Still bad, but a little less so"
keto,"I enjoyed the peanut butter one and the chocolate version enough to purchase again some time. I found them at Walmart and my local H-E-B grocery store. Price is less bad than most and taste is pretty good! 

I can see making these into low carb Rice Krispie treats when I feel like doing marshmallows with allulose again."
keto,"You‚Äôre not crazy! There used to be ‚Äúcasseroles‚Äù offered at some big chain, but I can‚Äôt seem to find it. The only other chain in the Midwest is Lou Malnatis and tbh their sausage keto crust isn‚Äôt very good (IMO)"
keto,Can confirm: tastes good
keto,"Fasting is not an option! I will be in jail for murder! ü§£
Congrats to you as well. If it works for you, go for it!"
keto,Going on year 4 and still do.  It's now just a habit and part of my routine and no desire to try dialing back to find where I start feeling like crap again.
keto,üëç
keto,"Cici's will make you a personal crustless pizza.  As indicated below, use your own judgement on the sauce.  I often leave a lot of it in the bowl and just eat the solid stuff, which still has plenty of sauce on it.

Blaze Pizza actually has a Keto crust.  Do not confuse that with the Cauliflower crust, which is NOT low carb.  They have both.  Their Keto crust is a decent vehicle to build a pizza on.  

Of course anywhere you go you can simply eat the toppings off a few slices.  I do this at Cici's as well.  I don't have guilt about not eating the bread since it's a buffet, but it's an option if I want a little bit of pizza, but not enough for them to make me my own bowl."
keto,"Pee sticks do not tell you if you are in ketosis. That is a fact. You may have thought that they did, but they didn‚Äôt. 

Of course the vaccine is keto friendly, it‚Äôs asinine to assume otherwise. The only reason you even thought to ask the question is because you are using pee sticks thinking they give you any useful information. That is why I pointed out that they don‚Äôt tell you if you are in ketosis. 

My first response was not rude or negative at all. My subsequent ones have been, as it‚Äôs a reflection of your responses in the thread. There is no god complex, just someone who apparently cares more about you not being misinformed than you do."
keto,"Once you‚Äôre not spiking and crashing your blood sugar with carbs, your hunger stuff should resolve. But give it some time, while getting into ketosis it‚Äôs important to eat, you‚Äôll like have crazy cravings for cards or in general. You can eat a crazy amount of keto food, but stay away from things that will make cravings worse like artificial sweeteners and sweet fat bombs. Those things might be ok in moderation later, but are terrible for first few weeks or even months. There is likely to be a period where you find all foods disgusting (around week 2) just remember things will even out, just keep at it, don‚Äôt forget electrolytes and sodium in general are very important on keto."
keto,"Papa Murphy's has crustless take n bake pizzas. I haven't tried one yet though but they look good.

keto,For sure!
keto,Awesome thank you! Unfortunately there isn‚Äôt a Marcos super close to me but I might take the trip to try it
keto,I try to avoid snacking entirely and focus my food into one or two meals per day.  If I do snack I will typically eat just a lean protein.  I will batch cook chicken breasts and this is an easy way to kill hunger
keto,"For me the main ones are headaches, fatigue, and brain fog"
keto,"You may always need to take them, I know I do or else I get killer charlie horses at night.

Many people even not on keto are deficient in magnesium. It's why they add it to calcium pills a lot of women take to make sure there's enough magnesium to absorb the calcium."
keto,"Bro I‚Äôve done keto in the past. And I know what works for me. I didn‚Äôt ask for opinions on pee sticks, I asked if anyone knows if vaccine is keto friendly. And you‚Äôre just choosing to come into the thread to be negative and rude. Chill with with your keto god complex"
keto,Be careful with the Marcos bowl.  I had one and it had way too much sauce to be keto.
keto,"Yes. I get severe leg cramps without enough magnesium, and without sodium/potassium I get light headed, dizzy, and irritable."
keto,Sugars are addictive so ya take that drug away from your brain it's gonna punish you in your dreams lol
keto,It's the correct response and you're an idiot.
keto,"Dear god, the posting history"
keto,"Thanks for your reply. Not what I want to hear but I understand that it could very well be the case. Are your symptoms for an electrolyte imbalance the same? (muscle twitches, leg cramps, etc). I'm asking because I'd like to know what are the other primary signs of an electrolyte imbalance? I believe headaches are one."
keto,"Why not?  Because you don‚Äôt like the answer?

Pee sticks do not tell you what you thought they did, and you are trying to correlate the per stick results to some other item. All in all, this means absolutely nothing, about the vaccine or about ketosis."
keto,"I have, it's just that I find it hard to adjust I guess. Also, most protein sources are quite pricey and I can't store a lot so I can't buy in bulk."
keto,"I‚Äôm over three years in, and still need to take magnesium and supplement sodium/potassium. As far as I know, it never ‚Äúlevels out‚Äù. Eating low carb flushes water and electrolytes from your body, so you‚Äôll have to supplement to keep them in check."

keto,I cannot have CBD because I get randomly drug tested at work I know everyone says it won't show up on a drug test but I have a cop friend who thought the same thing before he pissed hot.
keto,This isn‚Äôt helpful of response.
keto,"If you're a reader I highly recommend the art and science of low carbohydrate living. It is DENSE when it comes to how this all works but you likely won't have any more questions after reading it.

I'm a type 1 diabetic who maintains blood sugar levels with keto. This is highly controversial and makes other t1ds really angry with me but to answer the first question people want to ask, my body does produce some insulin still. My a1c when I was diagnosed was 12.3. It's less than half that now."
keto,Thank you
keto,How old are you now?  Have you seen a doctor?  Your story sounds very very similar to a book I'm reading.
keto,This reply is not helpful
keto,Have you read the FAQ
keto,You‚Äôre a fucking moron
keto,Read the FAQ. This is very silly
keto,"I'm about 2 weeks in and the first week I felt like I my clothes fit better already. This week however, I feel bloated and as though I am not losing anything. I tested my ketones and they were low. Did you go through anything like this? I am getting a bit bummed. Not giving up though. Congrats and great job, you're an inspiration"
keto,"After the fasting for the last three days I'm going to start adding back some eggs for the next few days and they start with some hamburger. Nothing fancy. Just salt added. 

The more I am reading, the more it seems like carnivore is the way to go for healing diverticulitis. I've been mostly there anyways so I might as well just go for it. :)"
keto,"Most of us fatties are insulin resistant, girl. That's why we're fat. Some will call it 'pre-diabetic'. It's because we've been working our pancreas' like Amazon warehouse workers all our lives.

It can be reversed by a low-carb diet, as can diabetes (T2) **along with** time-restricted eating (AKA: Intermittent Fasting), but of course it would be back (probably quicker) if you were to start eating high-carbs again! You would have to commit to a lifestyle change.

Glyburide does help, and even works well in conjunction with keto/IF/TRE. Too bad you can't tolerate it. Also too bad your doc doesn't encourage you to eat healthier."
keto,good for you
keto,"I have heard people say they had a rise in glucose after vaccination.  I don't have any supporting evidence or details, though. I did not have any issues,"
keto,"Sounds like a sign of addiction, carb addiction. My girlfriend, an alcoholic, complains of dreams where she drinks. It‚Äôs upsetting because she knows drinking can make her life fall apart and keep her from the life she wants. Apparently it‚Äôs pretty common for recovering addicts, she says. Take it as a sign that what you‚Äôre doing is important."
keto,lol sure bye bootlicker
keto,Thanks for sharing! I‚Äôm 4 weeks in and haven‚Äôt seen any weight loss for the past 2 so I‚Äôm struggling to stay motivated and this helps.
keto,So cool. I would love to be that even as well!!
keto,What that is seriously amazing?? Wow! Yes I can imagine! What a dream being so free without those crazy urges pulling you each day! I really hope I‚Äôll have the same experience. Thanks for sharing!
keto,This is absolutely a thing. My guess is most people's reactions range. Mine are usually arthritis related. And FARTS
keto,"Definitely feel you on this one, social pressure is huge to eat / drink the same things as everyone else. Eventually you're going to need to learn to tell people no. Nobody gets a vote on what you eat except for you. This is something you should be a little selfish on, at the end of the day it's nobody else's business imo."
keto,"Pulled pork is my number one binge meat. Trust me I feel you, haha"
keto,"I tried unbun crust last night for the first time (made a BBQ Bacon Chicken) and it was amazing! Definitely might be my new Friday night meal as well.

Edit: Also, making my own Keto pizza at home was far tastier AND cheaper than Blaze Pizza or this local joint called Love Pizza. They were both good, but not great."
keto,"Good point! For me, all type of nut butters are super binge-triggering especially so I think Imma just stay away from them.."

keto,I tried Pepsi Zero Mango the other day and agree. It was terrible.  It tasted like bubblegum flavor.
keto,"Good job.  It‚Äôs great to find something that works for you.   Keto is working for me. 
I was missing pizza, until I just started eating the tops and no crust.  

Not sure about nachos when I‚Äôm eating out? Wondering if anywhere has low carb chips??

Good luck!"
keto,I love doctors like these!
keto,I‚Äôve bought it a couple of times in the Orillia store
keto,"Depends if you have a varied diet or not, if you're deficient in something. For example, I need more magnesium and vitamin D3 (I'm deficient), so I take these supplements. I also have a multivitamin, but I don't take it everyday. I keep it more as a boost when I feel like I need it."
keto,"Nice work, yeah I get plenty of bacon and sausage in. They're a great for weekend treats as you say, they satisfy a lot of cravings for me."
keto,That actually sounds amazing.
keto,"Thank you. Yep, mainly chicken and salad during the week. I have a lot of fats on the weekend though, sausages, bacon, etc.."
keto,"While you're learning to cook, buy a couple of rotisserie chickens, let them cool. Debone them and put then in a container in the fridge. That way you can just stick it with any vegetable and have dinner and learn recipes over time.

You tube is also great because you can see what they're doing instead of just reading it. Headbanger's kitchen and Joe Duff are my favorite two channels."
keto,Start out with the bubbly with a salty meal. I find it makes a very satisfying accompaniment for food.
keto,"https://baseculture.com/collections/sliced-bread/products/keto-bread?variant=22469477007478

It's what use. It's a bit pricey but worth it for me. I buy it locally at Wegmans and Publix in their freezer section. Honestly love it."
keto,I‚Äôm less than a week into restarting keto and craving sweet. Can anyone recommend a good keto friendly syrup or jam substitute? I did make myself some sugar free jello to eat with my lunch and I have cloud bread with cream cheese for a snack that I think a bit of syrup or jam would be really nice with.
keto,"This.

Took me awhile to make the connection, but for me I'm prone to it on keto if my electrolytes get out of whack (even tho I've never gotten ""keto flu"" with or without supplementing).  There seem to be other more common causes, so you should check those out, as well.  But I've definitely gotten it more frequently and severely while on keto and it clears up once I take supplementing electrolytes more seriously."
keto,"Amazing dedication and good progress, just seen your photos. I assume most, if not all, of your calories are protein within that 600-1200 window? No point even eating fat if you ask me, with such a small calorie window I'd want to be eating as much protein as possible to retain my muscle."
keto,"You might want to check out Base Culture Keto bread. It's gluten free. I avoid gluten due to my Hashimoto's. I can get the bread at Wegmans and Publix in their freezer section. It's the only bread I use. You can also buy online.

keto,"If it's working, then it works. It might not be the healthiest way, but it's probably healthier than what you ate before. But ppl have already mentioned about the risk of slipping back into bad habits.

So think long game. What are your goals? If you reach your ideal weight are you sticking with keto or do you plan to add some carbs back in? Because even if you lose all the weight, but never developed any discipline, you'll end up gaining weight back. Plan ahead to prevent that.

But that said, I eat a pint of blackberries and 28g of Lily's chocolate every night for dessert. Mentally, having that final sweet thing is kinda like a closing ceremony. We had our favorite, now no more food for the rest of the day. (And then I mark my calorie app day as complete and stop). 

So I think you can use those snacks to help keep you on the wagon too. Just try to stick to one a day, and maybe occasionally 2 on the weekends (I'll grab a diet coke on a Friday as well. You don't want to feel like you can't live while eating healthy, but you don't want to waste all your calories on empty snacks either. Just find some middle ground and you should be okay)"
keto,Yes! I'm the same with Mission low carb tortillas vs La Tortilla Factory. Mission has 'modified food starch' and La Tortilla has ACTUAL fiber. I can feel the chew/texture difference. I call bs on Mission brand carb balance tortillas.
keto,"Wven though my cholesterol went up 20 points, my cardiologist was thrilled that my A1C went from 6.4 to 5.7!!  I was shocked.  He said overall it was more important to get the blood sugar and my weight down.  I think keto is becoming more mainstream as the doctors observe successful data with their patients."

keto,Not true.
keto,"I stayed away from all of those things the first 6 months I did keto (the snacks, NOT diet soda...I love that stuff). When I had a handle on my relationship with food (and had dropped 60ish pounds), I slowly added a little bit in while I worked to lose that last 20lbs. Now I‚Äôm eating keto at maintenance and I eat Quest PB cups, SF Jell-o, Enlightened ice cream, you name it. No problems for me at this point as I know how to eat it in moderation and not fly off the hinges.

If it works for you at this point though, then keep it up. üëçüèª We‚Äôve all got to do what‚Äôs best for us."
keto,"We in the village will await the return of you and your noble steed, delivering unto us The Bread Of The Gods."

keto,"Aldi's Zero carb is not bad but not nearly as good as bread- rather dry and carboard tasting. BUT it's the only low carb bread I have found near me so I buy it whenever I can find it in the store. I mainly use it for toast with over easy eggs (I remove the top crust for toast), french toast (very good) an breadcrumbs."
keto,1 strip a day. Wow. That doesn‚Äôt even come close to the normal testing recommendations let alone cover food testing. I have not tested the Mission tortillas because I use the Crepini egg based crepes that Costco and Sam‚Äôs carry and they have no BG reaction for me at all. At the risk of outing myself as a full on keto heathen I can happily report that Lily‚Äôs chocolate products have no effect on my BG either. They are stupid expensive but I eat a couple squares as a treat now and then. I‚Äôve also made chocolate chip cookies with their chocolate chips to the same effect.
keto,If you have an Aldi they have them.
keto,"I'll try cutting out gluten and soy next, thank you!"
keto,It's great for french toast. My favorite way to use it. Two eggs mixed with a tad of heavy cream and Walden Pond sugar free syrup.
keto,"We found out our toddler was allergic to soy.  It is in everything.  We already were gluten free (that runs in the family).  Turns out he is way more sensitive to soy than gluten, but 80% of gluten-free food is also soy free."
keto,"Good information! Unless I buy strips out of pocket Medicare limits us to 1 strip a day which makes food testing pretty impossible. Do you have any other commercially made low carb foods you have tested and found to have limited BG response, mission low carb tortillas etc?"
keto,"Oh okay that makes sense!! So many veggies have more carbs than I thought they did!! 

Thanks for your reply!!!"
keto,"Yeah, 114g is definitely enough or more than enough to satisfy your protein requirements. 

There are a lot of vegetables you can eat, cucumber, broccoli, and cauliflower included. All I'm saying is it pays to be fully aware of the carb content of each. You probably can't load up on all of those things in high quantities. Sometimes you'll need to be selective."
keto,"Man I was really excited for this bread, but each time I had it, I had terrible bathroom issues. Same as the aldi fiber bars, I think it's the oat fiber that messes with me. Just a fair warning if anyone is sensitive like me, to be aware that most keto bread I've found has oat fiber in it. I got one from Kroger recently and before I made a sandwich I turned it over and saw oat fiber, had to return it (now I'll make sure to check imbefore I buy, which I don't know why I'd didn't as I usually do)"
keto,"This is great to hear.

Also congrats on getting off your meds!"
keto,"Dear God, where??? Im dying looking at OPs picture."
keto,"Wish I could find it in the store! I've used up my frozen supply. Multigrain tastes much better than the wheat. I only use wheat for making breadcrumbs. Makes great french toast in AM.

How do  like that new Walmart meter? I was having trouble finding strips for the older model which uses micro amts of blood and bought this last week to replace it. I am very disappointed. I'm having a hard time loading the strip and it takes so much blood"
keto,"You can read the wiki page and check out the sources. But ketosis is converting some fat into ketones which certain parts of your body can use for energy, but your body can metabolize fatty acids for energy without needing to convert them to ketones first."
keto,"In 40 years I have seen PI 4 times and all were post-surgical. I am also thinking of a psych case years ago where an 80 year old woman kept screaming she was having a baby and staff kept charting she was delusional. I actually listened to her abdomen and found no bowel sounds and had not had a BM since admission a week before. She was taken to surgery and died postoperatively. She was about 85 pounds soaking wet. I suspected malnutrition was the cause for her bowel dysfunction. 

I know you want an answer but electrolyte problems in keto are not clinically significant and certainly not severe enough for PI. You are looking for a needle in a haystack. You know that even surgeons who are being honest would say PI is poorly understood and is complex since it involves spinal tracts triggers that are not easily pinned down. Outside the surgical  arena the incidence of PI is under 1.5%."
keto,WoW whit so many positive comments I think it‚Äôs but I have never used one in my life I have been estimating everything (SW 283 GW 190 CW 231-239) and now I‚Äôm on a wall can‚Äôt seem to loose more keep fluctuating between 231 and 239.
keto,"The extreme hunger sounds like a bad insulin reaction. If you are insulin resistant, and you've been trying to cut carbs, and you had a little sugar, it could have set off a chain reaction and spiked your insulin higher than it should have.

Like other people suggested, I'd lay off for awhile. Make sure you're getting plenty of protein and electrolytes to help you feel full and well as your body transitions to your next diet.

After a few weeks, buy a bar of Lily's chocolate (one row is about 14g) and try that. That brand is no sugar added but tastes really good, so hopefully it'll allow you to enjoy your favorite food without your body havering a bad time. Good luck adjusting, you got this!"
keto,How is fatty acid metabolism different than ketosis?
keto,"Female, 225, 5‚Äô9. I used the keto calculator here to figure out my macros. 

What freaking vegetables can I eat!? Only spinach???? I figured a cucumber is mostly water. Having cauliflower and broccoli later in the week."
keto,As has been stated-everyone is different. I do not have a sweet tooth so this is a non-issue for me. Stay within your macros and monitor your progress. If eating one product makes you want to have a second or third-might want to move on.
keto,But it took a while for them to come around to the medical backing. I saw them really not believing in it- even after discussing different studies until they saw it in practice.
keto,"&gt;only hit 114 g of protein 

What are your stats? For many people, 114g of protein is definitely enough.

&gt;somehow 43 grams of carbs

You list brussels sprouts, cucumbers, and whole squash in your foods for the day. This stuff adds up over time. Veggies are not too hard to fit in but sometimes you do still have to be choosy about which ones you have in your day. You mention tomatoes later on. They can totally be fit into a keto diet but you do have to keep in mind that usually means sacrificing a lot more of the less sugary fruits/veggies to make it fit your macros. It's all about what you value and find sustainable."
keto,"In Canada they sell Carbonaut bread. 80 calories per slice, 8g carbs, 6g fibres, 0g sugar.  Tastes like bread üòä"
keto,"Depends on your diet. Just because you're doing keto doesn't necessarily mean you are eating healthy and nutrious food. A lot of people doing keto stuff themselves with (ultra) processed foods all day that are technically keto, but aren't really healthy in the long run. If you're one of those people, a multivitamin would definitely not hurt, but the only real solution is to eat a healthy diet consisting of real foods and getting your micronutrients in that way."
keto,Inulin does this same thing to me...it's in Franz's ingredient list.  I learned this when I was eating the Fiber One brownies several years ago.  It was awful.
keto,"To me, the point of keto is that I don't have to control my eating, because keto foods are naturally satiating and so I lose weight while feeling full. 

Things that taste sweet generally get in the way of that, making food more appealing than it needs to be and so making us want to eat above our macros. They may trigger insulin, which makes our body want to store fat. As such, they make this way of eating harder, and it's easier to fall off the wagon. As such, for me all sweet tasting things are in the ""celebration day only"" bucket, and the rest of the time my snacks are some cheese or cooked chicken in mayo. 

If you are feeling full while sticking in your macros, and you're feeling energised and the weight is falling off easily, then obviously you are reacting fine to them and it's not an issue. But for me, eating sweet tasting things makes my body fight my weight loss, whereas sticking to savoury fat and protein makes my body lose without tracking."
keto,"If you can turn on the stove, flip a piece of meat a couple times and stir around some food in a pan, you‚Äôve got most of it covered."
keto,"The potential harm is that you have trouble actually staying within your macros. Slowly, subtly, letting things slip over time. You sort of addressed this and you're probably aware of it on some level with this statement:

&gt;every day I find myself wanting something sweet

The sense that snacks and desserts are a ""need"" rather than a ""nice to have"" is something a lot of people stumble over on keto. Myself included."
keto,"I'm coming to you as someone who used to be 245 lbs back in the 2000s. And I've never ""regained"" my sweet tooth binge addictions. This isn't specially keto advice.

It's ok to have a sweet tooth. In my opinion, the best way to manage it for a lifetime is to say ""yes, hello sweet tooth, I acknowledge you. Here's some blueberries. Isn't that nice? I'll give you some more fruit tomorrow. Goodbye until then.""

For me, and everyone is different, denying myself something entirely is a path to craving it and feeling guilty about it. Sure, when I'm losing weight I have to carefully track my macros and maybe some days go with something like sugar free jello for my sweet fix. But other times it's about being mindful and making choices. 

I lost my first 60 or so lbs eating ice cream every day. I saved up my calories for one serving, I looked forward to it all day as my dessert after dinner. I was able to say ""no"" to donuts at work and candy bars in the vending machine because MY choice today was that serving of ice cream.

Moderation. Fitting it into your macros. Being in control. Choosing to have it or not have it. If you feel like the atkins and quest snacks are leaving you out of control, then I'd skip them for now and point your mouth towards slightly less indulgent sweet choices like a small bowl of berries with cream on it.

Are you hitting your protein goals? Are you hitting your micronutrient needs? If you're not meeting your basics first because you're wasting all your calories on junk, then, again, maybe direct the sweet tooth elsewhere for a while. And/or put your snacks in your logging ap first thing in the morning, so you know what your plan is and you can build the rest of your day around your chosen snack for the day.

But for keto, I'm on the fence here of saying if you ""need"" to snack, you might need to focus on more protein and/or less artificial sweeteners for a while. Keto really should take care of most blood sugar troughs that often make us feel like we ""need"" to snack. Again, I'm talking about choice and control. If you don't feel like you can choose not to snack, then maybe it's best to avoid artificial sweeteners for a while.

My MAIN reason for keto indulgence snacks like atkins PB cups is for when there's going to be cakes and cookies and pasta around, and I choose to say ""no"" to those in favor of that damn delicious atkins PB cup I have in my purse that I know is compliant and won't kick me personally out if ketosis, in my experience. I don't know if that tactic would work as well if I just ate the keto chocolate bars every day and didn't see them as a ""treat.""

Anyways, that's my thoughts. Try not to stress too hard about it, since it sounds like overall you're doing great."
keto,"It‚Äôs a slippery slope. Are you really bettering yourself in the long run switching one bad habit for another? Before you know it you may find yourself going over your calories just because you‚Äôre eating excess keto junk food. 

I fell down that path last year finding myself binging on the keto junk food. So I had to completely eliminate all packaged treats. My diet is mostly meat with some veggies and fruit here and there, and rarely eat anything out of the package and if I do it‚Äôs pork rinds"
keto,I've only been able to find it in a 20oz at one place.  And I've looked in 4 states from work.  It was the best diet/ zero drink I've ever had
keto,"I have not found anything yet. But, I‚Äôm pretty conservative about keto products. I am mostly a carnivore but I do some keto intervals to break up the monotony a bit. I can live without most keto products but the appeal of a sandwich or a bun for my burger has me using these bread products during keto intervals. Purists will cringe but it works well for me."
keto,For myself getting over the sweet tooth was of primary importance.  Getting the weight off is just a small part of the battle for me.  Remaking my mindset is what will keep it off.  I feel the same way about Jenny Craig and those plans.  Sure they are great and you will lose the weight but when those 'special' foods are no longer available you just regain because your brain is still in the 'sugar reward' mindset.  I wanted to be free.  What works for others I can not say or judge.  I just wanted to be free of the harmful food addiction with 'sweets' as my reward.  I reward with smaller clothes.  No one can say but you what is harmful and what is not in your circumstances.  I was just tired of food being the boss.  If I need a substance to 'help me stay sane' I view myself as an addict.  I don't want to be in that space.
keto,"No, people who eat a high carb diet at a deficit do not enter ketosis. Ketosis is not the only way for your body to use body fat for energy, and even for someone in ketosis, making ketones is only ever a small portion of the body fat used.

keto," 

**THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR WEIGHT CHALLENGES ARE HORMONAL.**

In NEW YOURK TIMES, there is an article says that 99 percent of the weight loss resistance is hormonal.

According to Dr, Wood ,who is one of the top hormone experts, there are five hormonal blocks that affect millions of women and men. These hormonal blocks causes something called (Weight Loss Resistance), So, it would be impossible to drop even one pound. The solution is to adjust and fix these hormonal blocks in order to be easy and possible to loss weight.

THE FIVE HORMONAL BLOCKS ARE:

1. THYROID.
2. CORTISOL.
3. ESTROGEN.
4. INSULIN.
5. LEPTIN.

One of the most powerful and efficient treatment is **HB5** which refers to: (Hormonal Balance 5)

HB5 increases the energy in the body, makes the mood much better, improves the sleep and the **most important purpose it burns the fat.**

keto,"Yeah there are a few as That\_techno\_girl (below) has said, I tend to forgo wraps altogether and just put everything in a small bow. A little carb is good too, it's not all evil. lol"
keto,"First of all, your choice of sandwich is glorious!  Love me some Smoked Turkey and Gouda!  And thank you for sharing your blood glucose experiment.  I also thought that Aldi Zero Carb Bread was just pure Fuckery and Buyer Beware!  We don't have Aldi's here where I live in Arizona but traveling recently in another State (IL) I was able to buy a loaf of it and I did enjoy making sandwiches with it but thought ..... should I trust this?  I just wish I could find it again on my travels.  Reading of the Costco finds will make me want to try those as well. Thank you!!!!!"
keto,"Good luck! I was exactly where you are on February 23.. not that long ago. Was feeling awful about how I looked and physically just not very well, always gassy etc. I've been doing keto since then, and I am feeling SO MUCH better (even with a few cheat days here and there)! My husband too. You have the right idea, take it a day at a time and always have some keto food in the house. You got this!"
keto,"Good for you.  I noticed that many on here reward themselves with a big cheat meal which ends up being a binge of a day, week or month!  I think non food rewards go a long way to remaking the mind set which made us all obese foodaholics in the first place.  Great work!  Keto On!"
keto,What Keto products have you tried that did spike your glucose?  Bhu Bars and Catalina Crunch have spiked mine.
keto,"Everyone is different so take my opinion for what it's worth! I'm definitely a carb addict so I just can't eat the keto snacks. They make me want more and more food and give me the same out-of-control feelings I had previous to changing my diet. I got rid if all the sweet stuff, including the sugar substitutes, and I no longer have any desire for them. When I want a snack, I'll have some pork rinds or a piece of cheese and this works in quelling both my hunger and my cravings. That's just my experience though \~ if you're able to eat the treats without it triggering a desire for more, good for you!!!"
keto,"I'm not sure what you are saying is entirely accurate. Yes, people who eat carbs will lose weight in a deficit, but their bodies will enter ketosis once their carbs are used up in order to burn body/dietary fat. People who don't eat carbs have the benefit of always being in ketosis, and being able to avoid going in and out of it."
keto,"I too was buying this bread but I cannot find it at any local Aldi. I found Costco's keto bread and buns and they are really good. I also pick up Sola brand bread and hot dog buns when they are in stock (also, slim pickins) at Meijer.  
My local organic store sells Thin Slim Bagels but their prices are astronomical and I only get those on special occasions."
keto,I wish we had a keto bread like this in the UK.
keto,I'm 3 years in and I still cry in the fitting room.  Everything I pick to try on is too big.  I love it and it's great motivation to keep going.
keto,Imo the harm is in falling back on old bad habits and its a slippery slope. I personally find it easier to be consistent and strong and just removed snacks. After a week or so the craving goes away. I made  a conscious decision that I would enjoy the diet gains more than I would a snack and I no longer miss the snacks as I have convinced myself they are part of the problem not the solution. Ymmv..
keto,It has more to do with what is medically backed by enough data. If a doctor recommends a keto diet instead of a statin and you stroke their entire life is on the line in America.
keto,"I can't seem to lose weight! I've been in a stand still for the last 6 weeks. I work out and I've been eating based on my macros. I'm 5‚Äô6 195 goal weight is 150. Any advice would be great. 
I'm currently on day 3 of an egg fast so far I've lost 2 lbs but afraid ill gain them back."

keto,"How in the hell does anyone meet their protein goal!? This is my second day at attempting keto and I cannot figure out how anyone meets 160g of protein a day. Yesterday I had three eggs, four slices of bacon, a 1 carb tortilla, a whole zucchini, a whole yellow squash, 10 mushrooms, a big ass steak, some random cheese throughout the day, some pickles, a few olives, some feta and cucumbers, some ranch and a bunch of Brussels sprouts. I only hit 114 g of protein and somehow 43 grams of carbs. 

Today I‚Äôm going for a pork chop with some cooked cabbage for breakfast, a chicken breast with more cabbage for lunch, cheese snacks and pickles, and for dinner going to have a chicken leg/thigh with more zucchini and squash and tomatoes. I know tomatoes have carbs but I can‚Äôt just get rid of tomatoes. I love them more than bread!"
keto,"Yeah, i have no problem with the non American chocolates. Usually more cooca butter then too, which are some really good fats."
keto,"I want to say thank you for sharing this.  What I heard in this story was how a mom (a badass mom) just built the foundation for her kids to thrive in this world.  A world where their mom shows them how to take shit head on, and come out the other side better for it.  Rock on mom, it's just the beginning of greatness!  P.S. I love my mom and now you know that."
keto,Watch YouTube videos... they really help me!!!
keto,"I agree. Focus more on getting the proper amount of protein! It's way more important than getting a high amount of fat in your diet. You DON'T need a high level of fat to be in ketosis, just a low amount of carbs."
keto,"You're so lucky you can have gluten! All the breads that people rave about seem to have vital wheat gluten, so I'm SOL due to celiac!"
keto,Do you add cream soda?
keto,"No not better than real bread, better than the other keto breads. I don't even remember what real bread tastes like."
keto,When you have a craving set a timer for 15+ mins and give yourself time to think about what you are doing.
keto,Nature's Oven brand.  It's the best keto bread dear Lord i have a hard time if I run out.
keto,Boo-yah!  Good work!
keto,But how does it taste? You'd be better off just not eating the bread if it tastes like shit
keto,"That's a good point. My parents eat NO LESS fats than me measured in grams. But much more carbs, though considered as healthy. Especially loads of ""healthy"" fruits : ("
keto,"30 kg ? 

Set it to sedentary"
keto,"If you‚Äôre doing keto for health reasons, let them know that one bite could kill you.

Let them know you‚Äôre serious and their offerings is what will be your demise."
keto,"I noticed this as well about a week into keto (don‚Äôt come at me with electrolytes, I take plenty). It tapered off for me, and now I fee back to normal. I also use to ‚Äúrun cold‚Äù. I like to imagine that it was the fat burning üòÇbut most likely just the body switching over to full ketogenic mode."
keto,You were cold on day 1?
keto,2nd day... start of keto flu? Better keep electrolytes on hand.
keto,"I have always loved radishes. For some reason I never used to eat them. Now I get them, clean them, salt them and eat them raw. It's how I grew to love them as a kid with my grandpa, we'd pull them out of the ground, rise them with the garden hose, sprinkle with salt. Man, delicious and happy memories."
keto,"M 63, SW 367, CW 347, GW 210

I suffer from chronic lower back pain, and chronic for pain from arthritis. I've even had an operation to address my back.. I had a back pain flare up once since starting Keto in Feb 1. I noticed that I bounced back to normal much more quickly. I also noticed that my posture is better. 

My foot pain does not seem so intense and I've been able to walk the dog, much to his delight. üòÅ. I can cover 1 1/2 miles in 40 minutes. Not very fast but it is good to be able to take a walk again! 

How much I'm benefiting from losing over 20 lb and how much from keto is hard to say. I can say that I'm better off now than I was this time last year. In another 6 months, I should be under 300, and I may have further insight."
keto,Most likely due to electrolyte deficiencies and stress from adaptation
keto,"Sounds good but those packets can have carbs. I think Splenda has maltodextrin and dextrose, like 1 gram per packet. Small amt though."
keto,I think you‚Äôre mistaking ketosis with fat adaption
keto,"xylitol gives me a headache, I've never been able to handle it.  I've never ready anything that Xylitol is the best health wise, in fact quite the opposite that it's one of the worse sugar alcohols, 2nd only to Maltitol."
keto,Really? You can't put anything that doesn't praise keto in this thread. How about some balance instead of this cult like censorship.
keto,"Absolutely!  I've been keto for over five years now.  Aside from the weight loss, my migraines disappeared, menstrual cycle regulated, and knee pain is gone.
I work out hard with weights (highly recommend weight training!), go on regular hard hikes and am generally very active with no issues.  I've adapted some though and have more protein than what would be considered normal for keto anymore, but the beauty is you can adjust to what fits your life and lifestyle!  Stick with it, you'll do great!"
keto,"As others have said here, as long as you STAY on keto or even just low carb, your body has not way of going back to inflammatory issues caused by FOOD.  
There is, also, lots of information showing that your hormones, ALL of them, do quite a reset from each low carb. Someone said above that you can even gradually introduce SOME high-quality whole plant-based foods back into your diet and not suffer from all that ""former"" stuff.

It should ONLY be if you go back to the SAD (Standard American Diet) that the bad stuff returns. 

So keep up the good work and make it a PERMANENT LIFESTYLE CHANGE. All that ""mileage"" will stay with you ;-D"
keto,"I used to have horrible leg cramps especially in the middle of the night. I think that now that I pay more attention to my electrolyte levels, that they have been gone completely or greatly diminished and if I do start to develop a cramp it never fully develops at all."
keto,"Knock the food on the floor, like a cat. Give no fucks, like a cat."
keto,"It helped my arthritis, skin mood and libido. The biggest health improvement by far was it completely ended my reflux.

I had been on omeprazole for years with famotadine for breakthrough issues, usually a few times a month. Im not kidding or exaggerating when I say water could give me reflux. Keto stopped that cold turkey. 

I started my keto journey in August 2016, got my life changed by keto about 2 months in. Stopped keto in December that same year. Here it is almost 5 years later and still no reflux. I gained all the weight back, all the old problems came back.... but not the reflux.

Keto CAN change your life."
keto,I‚Äôve achieved my ideal weight as well after 1 1/2 years.  Now I flip flop every couple weeks.  I‚Äôm relatively strict with myself for the first 2 weeks.  Then I let loose a little on calorie intake and carbs.  I‚Äôll eat black beans and lentils everywhere I can use them.  I still stay away from standard starches though.  Then I‚Äôll flop to protein and tons of green vegetables etc.  After that back to strict keto....
keto,Well now I think I might try it.
keto,"My mum is doing Keto, she has RA too and she finds the same - after a carb day during special occasions like Christmas or birthdays she always feels really sore the next day."
keto,Fuck you. Legitimate question. Need answers.
keto,"For me, if a child MAKES dessert and it's like my birthday and they want me to eat a piece? You're damn right i eat that piece of cake they made me. 

Any other time it's a kid offering it to me my reply is ""oh that looks delicious, but it's way too sweet for me. You have my share.""

Then if it's an adult, I always assume they feel guilty about being the only person eating something ""bad"" or being the only adult eating the kid's junk. There's a few different ways I handle this depending on the person, how well I know them, etc.

I might say ""no, that's way too sweet for me, but hand me that [insert keto friendly snack food].""

Or ""you go ahead, I'm full from dinner"" or ""I'm saving my appetite for dinner.""

If it's a spouse situation, if needed i might go ""oh honey, I appreciate you offering, but no thanks. Remember we talked about what I want with my sugar intake. My grandmother and her mother both died from diabetes-related foot amputation infections. I don't want to risk being that kind of a burden to you and the kids. I have my snacks I enjoy."" And then if they keep cajoling, they get my RBF and ""this isn't up for debate. I said no thanks."" And any future cajoling is met with silence and a kinda look on my face that says ""sorry, there's nothing more to say."" I told the adult twice. They don't get more JADE-ing from me (Justify Argue Defend Explain) regarding topics that don't have anything to do with them after they get the same answer twice.

(If it's just them offering gives you the urge to eat it, just make sure to have keto-friendly snacks to turn instead. They may actually never stop offering and cajoling. You can't necessarily stop them from doing it.)"
keto,They‚Äôre low carb - but not 0 carbsz To get my minimum protein (100g) I‚Äôd have to eat 14 eggs a day. That‚Äôs 98g protein and 8.7g carbs.

keto,"Hi, new to the community.  Just started reading FAQ and top posts from over time and I'm glad I did.  I'm low-carb for 2 months, 1 month of strict keto (before that I was having a big fruit/kale smoothie for breakfast every morning.)

I fear I'm doomed to gain back any weight I lose because even on keto, I'm hungry all the time.  I've always been hungry.  I got pretty big in college and lost a ton of weight by going to the gym 6 times a week and being starving hungry 24 hours a day.  I was miserable and hated my life and decided I'd rather be dead at 30 than live like that anymore, so I started eating again.

I not surprisingly gained about half the weight back (only half because I avoid excessive desserts, drink basically exclusively water, and limit my fast food to once a week tops).  I decided to go low-carb but am feeling very similar to how I was with my last diet.  I'm always, always hungry.  I eat eggs and sausage for breakfast, I'm hungry by the time I wash my plate.  I have chicken bbq meatballs for lunch, I'm already salivating over dinner while throwing away the bowl.  In my entire life I've basically only been hungry, or satisfied.  I'm surprised to find that keto is supposed to be known as a defer hungriness diet because I'm doing better than I was before, much better, but my goodness I want to eat 10 hamburgers 3 times a day so bad.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been 2 months and I'm still hungry.  I've been at \~15g of carbs a day for 6 weeks.  Is my body still adjusting or am I doomed to fight hunger or be fat for the rest of my life?"
keto,"I'm not too concerned with comfort. I'm concerned with getting there in the first place. What I did that was successful before isn't working this time. 

I need a kick start."
keto,Carbs will feed your inflammatory chronic diseases.
keto,"Keto has been great for menopausal symptoms of aching joints and hot flushes. They stopped completely after about 2-3 months, until I started introducing sugar again and they came back. May be a coincidence but this is what happened to me. Going back to strict keto accordingly now ."
keto,"Thanks a ton! Judging from these facts endives look great, seems like I‚Äôll be able to eat a lot of them daily without getting kicked out of ketosis"
keto,"In my personal experience Keto has helped my inflammatory issues like my eczema, peripheral nerve pain, depression, gut health, and ADHD."
keto,"I have found that my taste buds have changed and the things I used to like taste yucky to me. We went out to dinner for our anniversary and I decided to cheat. At first I thought I was coming down with covid bc nothing tasted like I remembered!! 
It all tasted blech. Now when we have dinners out I have no problem sticking to protein and veggies.

My point being that you eventually won‚Äôt want the junk. Your body will naturally not crave it anymore. 
 
Be kind to yourself and take it a day at a time. Plan your doy and even pre prepare your food. Don‚Äôt go into situations hungry. Xo"

keto,"I have an SO that does the same. When this happens I try hard to remember the commitment I made to myself to do this, and consider if it was a commitment I made to someone else, would my urge/reaction be the same? 
Example: I‚Äôve committed to dropping weight for my good health. I don‚Äôt want to get to middle age and older and be poorly. A dozen little things add up into one big thing. If my having a sweet would cause my partner to have poor health, would I do it? Likely not. Give yourself the same commitment and care you‚Äôd give others.

keto,"Some sugar alcohols affect people that have sensitive digestive systems.

As others have stated, erythritol, stevia, or monk fruit are the 3 ""best"" sugar alternatives that doesn't affect or minimally affect your glucose level and is close to 0 calories. There are, however, a lot of products out there that are a mix of ingredients, including other sugar alcohols that may be 0 calories, but spike your glucose level like crazy. Try to find products without any additional ingredients that are bad for you. A product I really like is Lakanto, which is a mix of erythritol and monk fruit. I think xylitol tastes great (At least better than the 3 mentioned above), but it does affect your sugar levels a lot more."
keto,"This is tough. I'm sorry they're deliberately trying to derail you.  Unfortunately, you can't control others - only yourself.  We live in a carb world, and temptation will always abound. Stay strong and know that this community is a great place for support if you're not getting it at home."
keto,"Have to change your whole approach.

Stop saying ""I can't have it."" Change it to ""I don't want it."" I can't have it is a terrible mentality. If you're doing keto and posting on here, I'm assuming your goal is weight loss. The goal you're going for is way more important than immediate short term pleasure of a snickers, or some chips etc. If the end goal is more valuable to you than the immediate pleasure of whatever the food is, then you don't want it. Get off that ""I can't have it"" mentality. It will ruin you over time."

keto,"Electrolyte deficiencies can come to the forefront during Keto, including magnesium deficiency, and one symptom of that deficiency is anxiety:

https://drhyman.com/blog/2010/05/20/magnesium-the-most-powerful-relaxation-mineral-available/

Standard serum blood testing for magnesium is very poor at diagnosing magnesium deficiencies, because a blood serum level may appear to be normal, while tissue and cells can be extremely deficient.    There has been published research over the years where serum testing appeared normal and yet cell testing and even magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed tissue deficiencies.   It can take over a year of careful supplementation with well absorbed magnesium to resolve a deficiency, and without such resolution a deficiency and its symptoms can persist for decades.   Many lack the patience to persist when improvement is so slow.  I have heard of some patients with anxiety disorders where it was ultimately determined that they not only had magnesium deficiency, but that it was due to a genetic tendency to utilize magnesium poorly.   In some cases, where their magnesium levels in tissues/cells were brought up to adequate levels, the symptoms resolved."

keto,Please educate me.
keto,"Actually with keto I found I can workout longer.  Where before, I would gas out normally after an hour of cardio by muscles just would be done.  Now, I can easily workout for a few hours.  

In my experience carbs are good for short bursts of a lot of energy, but keto and fat seems to be the long slow burn and I can still push hard if need be.  I just need to up my fat intake if I plan on doing that.  I will preface this by saying during the first 15-20 minutes of working out my legs felt stiff like I needed to warm up, but after that I felt like I could go all day.  That feeling has since gone away now that I've been on keto for a few years.

Also, if I do have a cheat day, I plan it so I will go to the gym that evening and burn those carbs away."

keto,"I‚Äôve gotten panic attacks with coconut oil!!! So I read something somewhere about panic/anxiety can be triggered by digestion issues and coconut oil can cause an upset stomach for lots of people, so your body misinterprets the upset stomach and causes you to have a panic attack.

keto,"My experience is the same. And even BM are stinky. TMI I know, sorry."
keto,"There is such a huge list of so called ""chronic"" health issues and disease that Keto will reverse or improve because of its anti-inflammatory effects. If I eat some bad stuff I feel it hard the next few days. The bad food I eat is never worth it and the longer I go on keto the less often I feel like eating the bad stuff anyway. The memory of the old processed foods is always better than the reality. They don't taste that good to me and I'm not left satisfied like I am with real food.

Carbs cause high glucose and then insulin spikes, Those spikes cause inflammation and fat storage.  I think seed oils play a part in this as well, as they are high in Omega-6 which is also involved in inflammation. Most of our processed food that is high in carbs is also high in seed oils. Double whammy!

I will eat low carb the rest of my life too. I've stopped snoring. I don't get pneumonia every winter. I don't get sinus infections. I don't get colds. My back, knees, and hips don't hurt every day. I have normal blood pressure and don't take any meds for anything. My feet have arches again. I don't get blackheads or blemishes on my skin hardly at all and when I do they heal very quickly. I don't get ingrown toenails anymore. I don't have callouses on my toes, feet, heals, elbows, and knees anymore. I could go on and on. 

That doesn't mean life is perfect. I still get some carpal tunnel issues from side sleeping, but I don't have day time issues with it anymore. I've had trigger finger in my thumbs before and other weird issues that have all healed up over the last 2 years on keto."
keto,Adaptation and electrolytes
keto,"I feel like every other comment here emphasizes getting your electrolytes, though.

Headache? Electrolytes! Fatigue? Electrolytes! 

Running late for work? ... 

Electrolytes!"
keto,"Have you considered doing a 23 and me genetic test? They test for celiac genes. It showed I carry one mutation. Normally but not always, you need 2 mutations to acquire celiac. I had the same response as you. I love how I feel on keto, go off, and all the BS comes back. Turns out it is very possible to have just one mutation, and that can cause a gluten intolerance. It‚Äôs just an Avenue for you to possibly explore."
keto,"Any drop is good, but you definitely can do better.

I started keto around January 31st after months of eating like crap. I had lab work done on February 17th, and my A1c came back at 7.1% (diagnosed as diabetic). Keto is great, but it can't erase a prior 2.5 months of elevated glucose levels. At the request of my doctor, I started tracking what I ate and my postprandial glucose readings. Since I wasn't entirely sure about the accuracy of my glucose meter, I decided to get my glucose lab tested to compare with my meter. I also decided to get my A1c tested again even though it still hasn't been a full three months on keto and not even two months since the last A1c.

I just got my test results back, and my A1c is now 5.5%. IOW, my A1c dropped 7.1% to 5.5% in just a little over 7 weeks while doing keto."

keto,Yeah I end up tipping half the bag directly into my mouth like the savage I am.
keto,"Aw, thanks for the update on the tea party! Glad she was happy."
keto,"I found at the beginning - for about 8 or 9 days - that I didn't know what ""full"" was.  The feeling of fullness on carbs was hugely different to feeling full on meat and I had to learn the difference.  Drinking did help. Eating carbs made me feel hella full quite quickly - and sometime stuffed.  I'm not stuffed when I've had a lot of meat - I feel satisfied but by comparison my stomach feels ""emptier"" and I was mistaking this for hunger.  I've learnt now when I am full on meat.

Another thing I noticed was that initially I just...wanted to eat.  I was used to doing that.  I was thinking about doing that - so I had to be stricter with myself and sit and think - am I actually hungry or am I just bored?  - Not saying that's you by any means - it sounds tough - but that was my experience but it passed.  

Have you considered just eating fatty meat until you physically can't eat any more.  With that amount of fat and protein - no carbs in the way - as a one off it could help.  I had a 1lb rib eye and - it totaly did the job for me.  In fact I went off meat for a few days and just wanted fish.   
 Many ppl have said not to calorie count at the beginning and concentrate on saiety.  Chicken breast isn't fatty as I think others have said.  It won't keep you full.

Do you do a lot of exercise or do you have an active job? Is that an issue? 150lbs seems about right for your height.  

Good luck - please do update on this in a few days.  I think it will pass and you'll feel better."
keto,It's entirely possible but I just know that I am moody and tired under 25 but fine between 25-50. It may have more to do with vitamin/mineral intake perhaps than the actual number of carbs since it's inherently harder to get the right amount of micronutrients when limiting macros so strictly.
keto,"awesome, thank so much!"
keto,"I‚Äôm 50 and I‚Äôve been keto since Oct 2018:

-migraines gone

-skin clear and glowy

-more consistent energy levels

-a hip issue is pretty much resolved unless I overdo it

-can walk/hike for miles and don‚Äôt need snacks at all  

-have gained about 12 lbs back since last year due to SSRI antidepressant I started Feb 2020, but I‚Äôve tapered almost off it and the weight is coming off again. (I started ketogains macros recently)."
keto,"To add to what others have said about changes in technology leading to major changes in diet:

We are only looking at the very tiny recent history of mankind. For hundreds of thousands of years food, let alone carbs were scarce. It was only about eleven thousand years ago that agriculture started to change that fact. 

The Industrial Revolution in the 1800's led to big grain productivity improvements with the invention of the steel plow and railroad transportation. 

Come the 1900's industrial scale production of white flour made storage of grain products possible and transportation options led to large scale prepackaged ""food"" products.  Refrigerated railroad cars made fruits available year round.  After World War 2 artificial fertilization took things to a higher level.  

In the 1970s  ""Fat is Bad"" became a Dietary policy disaster.  Carb intake skyrocketed, along with obesity and Type 2 Diabetes.

Homo Sapiens were able to thrive with food scarcity for hundreds of thousands of years.  OTOH, food has become superabundant in the last century or so and lots of folks do not have the genes to handle that.  Just like some do not have the genes to handle lactose as an adult."
keto,Magnesium citrate before bed helped me immensely when I started keto and was restless at night. Eventually the lack of sleep gets better!!

keto,"I have a 24 hour cheat every week from Friday night to Saturday night.  Nothing is off the table for me but I find that my ability to overeat is limited due to the years I've been doing Keto.  Starting Saturday night, after my last cheat meal, through Monday morning (about 36 hours), I fast.  Monday morning at around 7:00 AM I start back on Keto by consuming bullet proof coffee.  I don't currently have any proof that I'm back in Ketosis by Monday morning but I just bought a keto monitor today so I'll find out this coming Monday.  I'm pretty sure I am. 

 All week I only eat between 7:00 AM and Noon (19/5 restricted feeding).  I take all the necessary supplements and get my electrolytes during that time.  I am never hungry when I go to bed, contrary to would you would think.

I work out Mon/Wed/Fri. (both weight lifting and cardio)

I've been doing Keto, intermittent fasting, and quarterly prolonged fasting for over 5 years so what I am doing may not be recommended for beginners.

When I began, I weighed 200 lbs (I'm 5'10).  I have weighed around 160 lbs for the last couple of years and find it easy to maintain with this routine."
keto,"Good luck! I‚Äôve had those sudden anxiety attacks myself, and they‚Äôre so frightening and distressing. Particularly when you‚Äôve made changes to alleviate and minimize anxiety, and it‚Äôs been working. And then a freak attack arrives. You have my sympathies! 

When I‚Äôm desperate for a brain/energy boost, I find mat√© can hit the spot, either a hot tea or a cold canned one, usually the Guayaki low sugar sparkling variety. Green tea can also be helpful but I haven‚Äôt yet found a variety I really enjoy."

keto,What do you eat that's pure fat?
keto,"I guess I was trying to convey that there's no ""shortcut"" to get into ketosis.  There's some amount of discomfort one way or another."
keto,It takes 24 hours to get into ketosis and it‚Äôs not caused by eating fat.
keto,"&gt; With carb cycling your not eating enough fat and **carbs** to go into ketosis. 

Do you mean proteins?"
keto,When you cheat you're only cheating yourself.  It could take up to a week or more to get back into ketosis.  With carb cycling your not eating enough fat and carbs to go into ketosis.
keto,Thank you!
keto,I am using Lakanto which I hope I don't have to give up LOL
keto,"Thank you so much, guys!  Keto is really helping with my type 2 diabetes and in 5 weeks my BS is already down from 377 to an average of 108 so I have no plans on giving up, just needed to see if coconut oil was one of the things I should cut.  Now I know it's probably not."
keto,"Feels like such a strange thing to get upset about....wait until she finds out about flatulence. That's going to really set her off!
In all seriousness, yeah it's natural. Its natural on or off keto."
keto,With keto: no gas stomach pains anymore from dairy. Lactose intolerance gone.
keto,"It sounds like you're on the right track. Particularly good in conjunction with ketogenic diet is the slow fitness style. By lifting weights slowly, neither gravity nor momentum assist you, so the muscles work more. Look up videos by Ben Bocchicchio, Fred Hahn, Doug McGuff, and Adam Zickerman."
keto,"Malnutrition isn‚Äôt just lack of calories. It can be lack of necessary nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. Agriculture allowed enough calories for large populations to grow, but at times led to nutritional deficiencies. I seem to recall an article that noted smaller statures among agrarian societies. I‚Äôm an American, too, and the obesity epidemic is a clear sign of cultural malnutrition."
keto,"Yes, I know, but that type is omega-9. High oleic Sunflower oil actually is the highest omega-9 compared too ther oils."
keto,"I read that! I'm hoping it does. It's draining..
Thank you!"
keto,You got it! :)
keto,"I know! But I was wondering what do your consider a good value of carbs with fruits and vegetables. Kind of like if you are buying something, what is like a good value for the amount you are paying. Not sure if this makes sense."
keto,It‚Äôs the daily amount that matters more so than the individual foods you eat.
keto,Are they good?
keto,"Ah, got you, thanks."
keto,I like your positive energy. I‚Äôve been thinking of changing my protein intake on non fasting days to chicken or Turkey breast. I‚Äôve never thought of blending it but sounds interesting. I may give that a try. Thanks OP for sharing.
keto,"I just made a note to check back in here on 4/17 - I will follow what you provided, thank you!"
keto,"Some people simply can't comprehend the difference in lifestyle choices that others follow. And sometimes their lack of understanding makes them straight up deny the facts or even attempt to put down those who strive for improvement, often times because they refuse to make a positive change in their own lives.

In my case, that person would be my partner and the yin to my yang. My exact opposite who doesn't work out and whose diet includes mostly carbs and bread. Hell, he loves his bread almost as much as he loves me and refuses to find any logic behind keto, even straight up calls it ""stupid"". His reasons? He's afraid I'll lose weight and become underweight again, as he knows I used to suffer from AN a few years back. However I made him realize that my goal with this is to actually gain more defined muscles and to experience the health benefits.

With a lot of talking and having peaceful discussions, he's now more acceptive of my lifestyle, doesn't complain when I ask him to get me only eggs, meat and nuts, and even started checking the macros of foods he gets for himself, hoping that it's suitable for me to eat. Frankly almost everything he eats is loaded with sugar and carbs but I appreciate his efforts."
keto,Cutie
keto,You can go to walgreens and buy blood sugar testers w/o prescription.  You don't need a doctor apt to test blood sugar.
keto,"That's crazy.  I don't know how a parent can allow their kid to do that.  I think part of it is that when your blood sugar runs crazy high for a long time, you stop being able to feel it.  If you get your glucose consistently in a normal range and then go high, you feel it.  I start to feel it pretty strongly in the 160's and 170's, and if I go over 200, I want to die.  I was diagnosed for a pretty long time before CGMs were widely available and accurate, so I spent a great number of years waking up with my blood sugar over 300 or so and not really know why or when it happened, because if I didn't feel it, I didn't check.  

I was talking to someone who was diagnosed with type 1 in the 50s.  They used to say that the goal was to keep your a1c below 10, which sounds crazy, but at the time, they had to pee on a stick to check glucose.  In the 80s, when glucometers became widely available, they changed that number to below 7.  I think it's high time that the recommendation changes to 5.7 or less.  It's easier now than ever before."
keto,"I haven't had issues with 25g carbs.  You can tell when you start having issues, brain fog, increased hunger, irritability.  You can feel it out and adjust as necessary."

Nowadays i will do a atkins bar (150 calories) 1/4 cup of nuts or a beef stick like vermont feed stick, as a snack but try not to have multiple snacks everyday because it will quickly eat up all your meal calories for the day. I eat 2 meals a day and i still struggle to not cut into them with snacks."
keto,"The ingredients are a HARD pass. Goes with most of the KETO variations honestly though. More products like these should be showing up during covid honestly. Every single time though, I want them to be a good solution. Its a problem that doesn't have a fix though, buns on keto are obviously not ideal and nothing is going to fix that.

The one thing going for it is the calories, its generally less than a regular bun. Calories better spent on actual food though. I would maybe consider it if I wasnt on keto."
keto,"Yes, I don't see anything wrong with it."
keto,What is your height and age?
keto,You go girl.
keto,Yes I want to use it because it's neutral and omega-9
keto,"This was my first thought, too. Also, your face muscles need that exercise or else you'll start to look like a blended chicken breast yourself."
keto,"As a volume eater, I think I am really lying to myself when I am 'eye-balling' meat...instead of using food scale...instead of 300 cal, I am probably putting 500 cal but logging it as 300 cal. This reminds me to really weigh my proteins!"
keto,"Congratulations! Thanks to your post, I am looking into Carb Manager app, looks very interesting!

What does ""drank over a 5th of alcohol"" mean?"

keto,"So I've lost about 80 lbs over the last year or so simply by calorie counting (no keto), but I'm interested in keto for the sake of maintenance and a healthier lifestyle, especially after my breakfast this morning. I was in a bind, so all I had were three boiled eggs; here I am almost five hours later and still not hungry. Is this level of satiety normal or even healthy? If I pursued a fully ketogenic lifestyle, is this the sort of thing I could come to expect (longer periods of satiety with smaller portion sizes and, presumably, lower blood glucose spikes)? The FAQ and beginners guide push the lack of a blood glucose spike pretty hard (which is attractive to me because I struggled for years with obesity and probably am at higher risk of developing diabetes), but I'm just a bit startled at how satiated I feel on what is a relatively small amount of food and calories. Is this concern warranted or is this normal?"
keto,"You know, if you just put those chicken breasts in a food processor with some salt, pepper, one of those eggs you eat, a splash of vinegar, a tablespoon of mustard, and your favorite, healthy oil . . . you get chicken salad."

keto,"There is a young man where I live that has T1D, not very well controlled. 

I was blown away one day, he was in the ER one day he had a big sore on the bottom of his foot. They had been treating him for months, it was the beginning of the summer, I heard the nurse tell him if he treats it all summer they hope by fall he will be able to walk at school.

The nurse talked to the mom, I am sure for the 50th time that he needs to change his diet, needs to find some way to get some exercise etc. the mom‚Äôs response was, well I don‚Äôt like to make his food choices for him or make him different from his friends. 

This kid was under 5 when he was diagnosed with T1D, she had years that she could have taught him how to make better choices. I do get it as if not being able to walk for 6 months makes this kid more normal?

Not sure if he moved away when he was done high school. If he stayed here 3/4 of our doctors preach low carb or Keto for diabetics, pre diabetic and anything else it can help with."
keto,It‚Äôs a good thing I don‚Äôt get coconut milk from there. Yuck. How did you figure that out? Asking?
keto,"Towels, then belts, then clothes."
keto,You look fantastic! Congrats on your amazing progress!!!
keto,I was morbidly obese and have lost 65 pounds in 4 months. Most of the weight was in the first 45 days. I've been tracking about 2.5-3 pounds per week but I believe it was because I dropped the weights and started running (I have a nasty cycle f bicep tendonitis). I'm only 15 pounds to my goal so I have set expectations to have to grind these out.

keto,Why don‚Äôt you just eat the chickens . Not pulverized?
keto,Are you eating any eggs too? Or cheese? Or is it just meat?
keto,Haha. Same.
keto,Ummm ... chicken smoothie? Well whatever works!
keto,"I use isopure zero carb almost daily. There are days when I plan my meals and I won't need the shake so I skip it. Like others have said, you can still hit your goal with whole foods. However, swapping another serving of meat for a shake works for me. It also helps me keep my fat intake in the more moderate range."

I had someone like this in my life. I spent so much time and energy trying to get their approval. Years of them beating me down mentally that I was never good enough. What I've learned from that is there's no point trying. Ignore him. If you eat healthy it is wrong. If you stop eating healthy he'll be all 'i told you so and beat you up for stopping and gloat that he was right. I found the best way to deal with someone like this is make yourself and your responses when you're with them as boring as possible. Dont offer information, and dont let him see hes getting to you. And try not to see him as often. Ymmv but thats what I've found works best."

keto, I too am mindblown.
keto,"No, if the label says 0 calories that‚Äôs dependable.

What I believe I have seen is that certain brands (can‚Äôt recall which ones specifically right now at this time) will label their drinks cleverly as diet/healthy but actually have calories in them, which are of course empty calories. May be regional differences, since I‚Äôm not based in the US, but in any case best to check the label."

I don't do much diet soda but on occasion I'll have one...and I did buy a pint of halo keto ice cream but I spread it out to a few servings.

keto,"It‚Äôs probably best not to snack as you see with the ice cream. Snack foods are usually hyper palatable, calorie dense foods that are easily over eaten. Eat more Whole Foods at meal time and you shouldn‚Äôt feel the need to snack.

keto,I‚Äôm going to have to stop buying it. What are some good snacks to eat? Rebel was like my only snack
keto,"You should be encouraged by your post!  There is so much openness to change. Kudos!

Too much of anything will have consequences.  Start with an app to track your macros and micros, plus water and caffeine intake.  Monitor exercise too, if you can add that in. 

Regarding your diet soda question,  it really depends on the sweetener.  There are articles showing that some diet sodas cause an insulin spike. You likely already know why that is negative for weightloss. 

Keto flu tells you that your electrolytes are off. See the FAQs for more information. This is critical to maintain your ongoing success! 

Lastly,  look at other options instead of the rebel. Variety is the spice of life and it also helps ensure you get enough vitamins and minerals. Maybe alternate with sugar free jello, sugar free pudding, and my go to: homemade whip cream and blueberries or another lower carb fruit. 

Keep reading and asking questions! üí™üí™üí™"
keto,Thank you. I am going to stop eating Rebel. I don‚Äôt need that.  You said that diet sodas still have calories. Every diet soda I have drank says zero calories - is this misleading or wrong in any way?
keto,"I use protein shakes a lot and it‚Äôs kept me keto this go around.

I‚Äôm at 85g protein and usually am not hungry enough to hit my macro without them.

Fairlife and Premier brands are good and 30g protein each 150cal shake.

I use the vanilla in my coffee as creamer :)"
keto,"You need to be eating at a caloric deficit to lose weight, you can calculate your macros using the calculator in the sidebar. I definitely recommend reading our FAQ! :)

keto,I think you are right. What do you mean by calories drive weight loss? I keep seeing that not sure I understand yet
keto,"To lose that amount of weight and in that amount of time (whether or not on keto) you‚Äôd need to watch the calories carefully. 
Downing a pint of low carb ice cream every other day means you‚Äôre taking in a lot of calories.

The diet soda is probably fine (but again, some diet sodas still have many calories in them and could throw you off your path towards success).

Last thing to note is that - in my view at least - diet sodas and low carb ice cream can still trigger sugar cravings psychologically because of the sweeteners used, making it more difficult to stick to the Keto diet.

Good luck!"
keto,"I had to stop buying it, it's so damn good."
keto,"You have to be careful with that as well, since it‚Äôs so calorie dense. When I buy keto ice cream I eat a serving at a time. 200 calories is much more manageable than 800 when you‚Äôre trying to stay in a deficit"
keto,"Calories drive weight loss AND weight gain. You can and will gain weight if you overeat, keto or not. I say quit buying Rebel. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
keto,I know the struggle and I see you. You look amazing!
keto,When the plato.stop?
keto,I think I need to cut it out. I was clearly binging the first few days. Maybe make it a once a week thing
keto,Hey I'm really sorry about your pets and hope you're ok.
keto,Yeah I thought so as well.
keto,"Whatever amino acids are in there, carnitine would be the best case scenario."
keto,"Though I don't know if he'd agree to another bet, I might try this. Thanks."
keto,Congrats
keto,"Thanks, I will tell him that even if it isn't carnitine. Maybe he will make the connection then."
keto,"Thanks for your thoughts on the keto flu, but this isn't about me :)
I'm fine with keto and my electrolytes."
keto,"I've built my binging habits into my routine for exercise and the like. 

It works really well with my cyclical ketogenic diet and the IF life. Basically IF/OMAD a heavy carb day before my 3+ hour exercise days then the rest is ketogenic until I feel the carb crunch and start the cycle again before the next 3-4 days of exercise. 

Talking with family back home though I was glad to not be there and smell all the things they were showing me. Rice and peas, mac and cheese, hard dough bread etc."
keto,"Thanks for the hint. I've already taken them out of the list.

Do you have any suggestions for other meals/ingredients of this kind? (Ready to eat/no cook)."
keto,"You can't stop him from spending his hard-earned money on snake oil. Since you are doing keto, make a bet with him that you'll lose more weight in two weeks on keto than he will on his magic potion. If (when) he loses the bet, he has to go keto with you for two weeks.

He probably won't take you up on this, though. Deep down, he knows the snake oil will fail.

All you can really do is shut up about him and set an example- and you'll be doing that."
keto,"He's chasing the fantasy.

It's like someone playing video games to excess, or drinking alcohol, or doing drugs. It's an escape from reality. 

Even after it doesn't work, he may continue taking it."
keto,"&gt; you lose 50lbs in two weeks

I don't know if someone who actually believes that can be helped. No offense."
keto,"&gt;How can I make him see that this is just the same make-believe as any other wonder drug? 

Honestly, I don't think this is possible. 

Sometimes, just stating your opinion and not pressing the issue is the correct approach. If you press too much, he may resist it even more. 

&gt;he quit it even before keto flu hit him

On an unrelated note, the keto flu doesn't need to happen. You just need to supplement your electrolytes properly and it won't happen (and by that, I don't mean Gatorade Zero). 

If you're not supplementing your electrolytes right now or not eating rich-electrolyte foods every day, I'd suggest that you do. Some people have fainted for not having enough electrolytes, even years after having been on Keto."
keto,"It's hard, it's really hard because your changing things that were your normal for most of life so far and now you need to make a body and mind believe in and get used to a different kind of normal. Just hang in there! It gets easier and with all the great advise on here you will see more results  keep going and don't give up on yourself. 

You'll look back later and be thankful you kept going.
A the best."
keto,"Out of those ingredients the only thing that might have an effect on weight loss is amino acids (carnitine).

&gt; Efficacy: Studies have primarily evaluated carnitine‚Äôs effects on lipid levels, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes; weight loss has been a secondary outcome in most studies. In a clinical trial in 258 patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, 2 g/day L-carnitine plus the pharmaceutical ingredient orlistat (360 mg/day) for 1 year significantly increased weight loss compared to orlistat alone [86]. However, 2 g/day L-carnitine alone for 6 months did not affect weight loss in 94 overweight men and women with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [87]. A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis combined the results from nine carnitine supplementation clinical trials in adults (including the two described above) that assessed weight loss [85].The trials included a total of 911 participants. In eight trials, the daily carnitine doses ranged from 1.8 to 4 g/day L-carnitine or levocarnitine for 30 to 360 days; in one trial, the dose of L-carnitine was 15 mg/kg/day for 182 days. Overall, study participants who received carnitine supplements lost an average of 1.33 kg more weight than those who received a placebo. Additional research on carnitine for weight loss is warranted.

But definitely not to the point of losing 25 lbs/week."
keto,I like to have a low carb tortilla (mission carb balance whole wheat) with peanut butter.  You‚Äôve covered most everything else I can think of for ‚Äúon the go‚Äù.  Maybe some Lilly‚Äôs dark chocolate if you‚Äôre into that.
keto,"Yeah I feel you 100%. For me what helped is just accepting ""This is how it is"", this doesnt mean I am justifying to stuff my face or going off track but if it happened, well it happened, cant change it now anymore. 

So there is no point of beating me up for it. Some people just can try keto and stay hardcore keto for as long as they want. Thats cool. Some people try keto and they cant. Thats also cool.

Just try as good as you can right now thats the best you can do and be compassionate and loving towards yourself even for your flaws."
keto,Very good post. I just noticed I‚Äôm gaining some love handles.. most likely due to eating out of boredom.
keto,Yeah I know that. I was looking for proof bc he won't take my word for it and apparently isn't willing to use his brains.
keto,If it's claiming 25 lbs loss per week I don't think it can't get more blatantly obvious that it's a scam.
keto,"Any other pro tips? I'm always happy to optimise my sleep because it's the most important thing, pretty much. Stuff that works for me:

* Darkness. I have black decals on my bedroom window, zero light from any source, including any electronics
* Duck feather pillows, often with one between my legs
* AC set colder than I think I can handle
* Fan for white noise and air circulation
* Atomiser with high quality lavender oil I turn in an hour before sleep but do not leave on over night
* Putting my phone in another room two/three hours before bed
* Turning off all the lights a few hours before bed, except for a red lamp
* GABA &amp; L-Theanine

That's off the top of my head, and obviously everyone is different"
keto,"You need to change how you think about sugar and white flour. It‚Äôs addictive stuff, you‚Äôve been binging on it your whole life, and it‚Äôs made you fat. Alcoholics can‚Äôt allow themselves the odd shot of vodka if they‚Äôre serious about sobriety.

It‚Äôs time to see all that sugar for what it is: empty of nutrients, doing nothing for you except providing that brief dopamine hit."
keto,how does that make any sense?
keto,"Reading the book ,""wheat belly"" opened my eyes to how addictive grains and sugars are.  Nobody here binging on chicken and cheese sticks lol :p"

keto,"I've added some sources, sorry it took a bit of time to find them again."
keto,"Thank you friend but I have read those and I can't recall my issue ever being addressed anywhere in either of the links you've supplied me with. My issue, in short, is that I'm doing everything that is required of you on keto, but not in any way experiencing keto, not in the slightest"
keto,"Interesting. Can you share where that‚Äôs been disproven?

To the OP‚Äôs point, carbs, protein, whatever ‚Äî it sounds like you *should eat after a workout, fast or no fast."
keto,I didn't know about them. Thanks
keto,"When I'm on keto it's hard for me to eat more than 700 calories because the fat is so feeling compared to sugars, but yes you can binge eat still."
keto,"&gt; I was always told to eat protein within an hour of working out, otherwise you're denying your muscles the energy they need to rebuild after a workout.

That's been disproved. It does not matter when you get the protein as long as you get enough of it. What does matter is when you get your carbs, the amount of glycogen resynthesis drops greatly the further it is away from the end of the exercise."
keto,Already edited it.  Do you have any actually suggestion on the type of meals/ingredients I'm looking for?
keto,Ok. Any other suggestions?

keto,"(BED can also be associated with ADHD, just saying ... I could eat all I wanted in the mornings and lunch and at dinner I could still binge and eat a lot of calories. This approach didn't help me until I was diagnosed with ADHD and was able to become aware of those tendencies)&gt;"
keto,"What a fantastic unexpected benefit. Closer to goal weight, closer to g*d"
keto,"I try to track my eating with my hormone cycle - because I tend to binge when at a certain part of my cycle, which links in with my ADHD and PMDD - like when I have some specific hormones circulating through my system, all my best plans go out the window. Like, I could eat all the protein and fat I would want to, and it feels like I've literally eaten nothing. 

But, meds for ADHD helps, \*knowing\* and tracking helps a bit too so I can maybe be a bit nicer to myself when I go off the rails - but when I'm in the middle of it, I still forget that its a specific thing."
keto,"Kinda sorta. Say I make a chicken casserole. I work hard to build a balanced one. Cut chicken and veggies about the same size, make even layers etc. In part because I like a pretty casserole, in part because if it is saved by weight as whole recipe, and I glop 100g of it in a bowl, I will get pretty accurate macros on that 100g.

Now I eat pot roast frequently. I make it my one meal of the day, so I can enjoy the potato, onion, carrot etc.

So I will follow the same procedure in terms of sizing my veggie pieces, so they are about small bite sized. When it comes time to eat I chuck 10 ounces of meat or more on the plate or in the bowl. Then I will weigh out those high carb veggies until I hit about 15g net carbs.

Then I cut my meat to bite size, and my personal rule is I will eat one big bite of just meat, then one big bite with meat, and veggies.

It works out so just about the time I am stuffed I hit the end of dinner lol. And since I have a few carbs to spare I round out any protein I am short with a protein shake.

That is my pro tip for feeling like you are ""cheating"" WITHOUT screwing yourself up.

Once you reach a point in keto where you are comfortable eating your entire macros or dang close to it in one meal you can get away with stuff like this.

Now with soups I build the recipe like casseroles. Then when I ladle it into the bowl, I ladle the solids first and eyeball to insure I get pretty close to half meat half veggies. I also use mostly low carb veggies to be safe, higher carb ones for color and flavor complexity only. So lots of greens, cauli rice, broccoli. Shredded carrot, fine diced red bell pepper, tomato. 

Then I add a ladle of liquid and log the final weight. I almost always make clear soups since my calorie limit is so dang low.

If I want a cheese or cream base soup I make a single portion only and it as the one meal of the day. Otherwise I can't get enough to make it worthwhile. Mind you when I want to lose weight I have only 1109 cal daily to work with, and even now I only have 1450 to work with 

So all typical recipes generally will need tweaking for me. Hubby maintains at 2200 or so. So he can get away with all kinds of food I can't go near lol.

Once you get used to the basics, and weighing and tracking, then you can comfortably explore all the ways you can enjoy new,stuff without messing up the carbs. You don't want to mess those up because keeping them low minimizes cravings and avoids trigger foods. 

When I find a trigger food it is off the menu entirely. It is notfood to me. I need to be strict because I am managing t2d, fibromyalgia and IBS. So I can't afford to mess myself up. 

I can't live the good life if my pain and inflammation come back, and I know from careful testing that even hitting 25g net is risky for me."
keto,I'm just saying it worked for me. Nothing else would. I dropped weight and kept it off. Started last April and still on keto. Calories literally don't matter unless you eat way over a normal amount
keto,I failed again.  And the worst part of it is I eat stuff that doesn't even taste good and keep eating it in hopes that it will taste like it used to.  So stupid.
keto,"I think what keeps me from REALLY GOING FOR IT is that I‚Äôm terrified of losing weight on keto and then gaining it back and then some if I slip and then fall down and then roll down the hill and then splash into the quagmire that is the TAD. When I‚Äôm DOING keto, I have no desire for carbies, but after a few jelly beans it‚Äôs just a nice memory, that satisfaction and feeling great. That sounds like planning to fail, but I‚Äôve seen it happen to too many people."
keto,Try cross stitching!  It helped me quit smoking!
keto,"Ooof, warning: pity-party ahead.   



My keto-ing has been on and off over six or seven years now because of my BED.  It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt have the ‚Äúswitch‚Äù that says yep, that‚Äôs enough, time to stop.  I think I‚Äôve lost and regained the same 70-ish pounds three times now, and am nearly halfway through round four.    



Even when I am able to eat just keto foods (which is not currently the case), during BED flares/episodes, I can‚Äôt stop eating.  I get to the point that I don‚Äôt *want* the food, I know I have objectively eaten enough already, my stomach actually hurts from feeling physically over-extended (even though I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúfull‚Äù)...and I just. can‚Äôt. stop. shoving food into my face.    



There‚Äôs an obvious psychological component, and I am seeing a doctor who is looking at my OCD meds, but appointments are easily eight weeks apart, and in the meantime, I just am SO miserable.  *Knowing* all the things doesn‚Äôt make any difference and all I do is beat myself up over it, which doesn‚Äôt help either; it just makes me want to eat even more.   





Since there‚Äôs no precipitating traumatic event for this particular round that I can think of (there have been grief-induced self-soothing behaviours that I can point to for other ones, where I didn‚Äôt have/couldn‚Äôt exert the self-control I needed to rein things back in after a very significant person in my life died a very gruesome death, etc.; that one I could sort of understand), I am at a loss as to what to even try to address so that I can get back to feeling normal (and losing the weight would be great too, but at this point, I‚Äôm more concerned about the mental health aspect and compulsive behaviour).   I feel so much better when I‚Äôm able to be on keto and not constantly obsessed with eating, and not all inflamed from the carbs/sugar.   



Anyway.  I am really glad for those of you who are doing well!! I‚Äôm looking forward to being one of you again ASAP."
keto,so if you made pot roast or something you‚Äôd just weigh out 5g and then it would automatically tell you the macros in the serving you ate?

keto,"Yup i cut back on the cheese a ton, is not bad or anything but my god it's so calorie dense just like nuts and avocado. 

Honestly I've been eye balling fat free cheese slices because im seeing 30 calories per serving and that's just like amazing to me. 3g of net carbs though so yeah pick your poison &lt;/3"

keto,"I joke every year now. Passover used to be torture. Torture! Because of my carb addiction.

And now it's just another week."
keto,"Eggs are weighed by the company, so if I eat 3 large eggs I log 3 large eggs. Bacon or pieces of anything that are not a standard size get weighed.

For weighing salads and such, build it in the bowl on the scale, tracking things as you go. Including ranch dressing.

Remember that 6 month stall I mentioned on my last diet? This directly resulted from using a tablespoon for home made ranch dressing lol. Which is so thick it doesn't level in the spoon. And 100 calories or so per spoonful...

So these days I build the salad on the scale, tare the scale, and weigh the dressing.

Cup measures are for liquids or small uniform things that pour freely like salt and chia seeds. If you use them on veggies you lose a lot of carbs, because it may look like a cup but up to half the space in that cup may be air. So not only is your nutrition off, you are counting carbs you could be eating! When you love tomatoes as much as I do that isn't an option lol.

It takes minutes to weigh things or less once you get used to it. More than worth it to get the most for your carbs id for no other reason, especially if you like heavier carb things like carrots, peppers, tomatoes, cranberries...

My weighing and tracking takes at most 5 minutes a day. But if it really fussed you, you can meal prep veggies and pre portion into containers or ziploc bags a few times a week and write the weight on them. Then you can just grab the ones you want and track. 

Or build a day's worth of meals and snacks the night before, before bed, with the exception of sauces or dressings and log them in advance. 

All kinds of ways to manage this, but if I were going to eyeball anything it would be whole meats. Because honestly it is tough to overeat, I always eat my protein first and it has no carbs. Anything with a carb gets weighed.

As to recipes, I build them in cronometer and save them by weight rather than serving size, then when I make them again they come out the same. And cronometer gives me the actual macros for whatever serving I weigh out."
keto,"Same experience here.

I hate eating large meals now. Incredibly uncomfortable.

Snacking is really my only ""temptation"" nowadays. Fat bombs may be low carb but they've still got calories!"
keto,"I embraced my binge eating by just binging on spinach salads, low cal low carb high volume.

I don't use salad dressing i just use my guy G Hues bbq sauce and some vinegar based hot sauce for super ultra low calorie dressing.

keto,"Maybe it has something to do with the Cpap itself, does it not humidify enough? I had to wear one for a week during some sleep testing and I needed it to be more humidified and kinda felt like it dried me out. Also I could not sleep with one on it was the worst"

keto,"You're doing awesome, you JUST started, you did it through 30 days. That first 30 days changed my life. I was just too tempted to see what would happen in 6 months, if 30 days could be that drastic. Did you take a pic before and at 30 days? The pictures are what did it for me. I took them every month or even couple of weeks. It's just insane. And I took my time, I didn't count calories (and still don't) or even weigh myself for a long time, just went on pants size at one store alone (started at size 18 at American Eagle, currently in 4.)"
keto,Thank you so much for all of your help! I don‚Äôt have a food scale  but i‚Äôll definitely get one now. I‚Äôve just been using a keto plan that I found instead of weighing things out. So if they tell me to eat a cup or two do something that‚Äôs what I usually do. I also use the ‚Äúlose it‚Äù tracker (which i like a lot so far) but just downloaded the one you mentioned because I saw a few people here talking about it. Do you weigh everything you eat including eggs for breakfast and bacon or something of the sorts? I feel like I would weigh out my meats but just go by the serving sizes for spinach and other little things or if I found a recipe I liked and they told me a service size was a cup then I would go by their stats which probably isn‚Äôt the most accurate but not as time consuming in my opinion
keto,"[Find yourself some distractions](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;client=ms-android-virgin-us&amp;source=android-browser&amp;q=healthy+distraction+techniques), chug a glass of water, etc"
keto,"Common concept. I shall not opine on that since cheat meals are a taboo subject around these parts and I approve of the rule lol.

I will say several things though. Weight loss is NOT LINEAR. Not on the people scale, which sucks rocks. Your food scale and good macros are your best friends. Because every day you are in a deficit you are losing weight. A very small amount. 

However, intestinal contents, retained water, full bladder etc can hide that on the people scale. As a chick, your weight is also massively affected by hormones and your cycle. Exercising more or less can affect water retention. So can weather and electrolyte issues.

That is not fat gain or loss. That is water weight changing.

I weighed daily always when losing, logged it every day and FORGOT IT. Once a month I looked for the lowest day the previous 2 months and plotted the trend and still do. So long as that trend goes the way I want it or stays flat it is a win.

At any given time your weight can fluctuate 3 pounds or more day over day. Even week over week. I went 6 weeks with no scale loss at one point, circling around the same fraction of a pound. But because I knew my macros were good, weighed everything I ate, and tracked in cronometer I knew I was losing.

During that time I dropped 7 inches overall, 1 clothing size and 1 shoe size. Then I lost 4 pounds on the people scale in 2 weeks.

That is how weight loss works. Some months I lost inches, no pounds. Some months pounds not inches. Some months both. 

It is not a stall unless you go 6 weeks with no change at all. And as a diet veteran, I can 100 percent tell you in my case there have only been two reasons that happened.

Either I was not weighing and tracking my food, or I had something medical going on like when I got a new med that messed with metabolism.

The single biggest common denominators around here for people not losing weight are the ones you would expect. They are not weighing and tracking with a good tracker. They are not adjusting macros as they lose or have bad macros. They are chicks comparing weight loss to dudes. They are simply impatient. And in a lot of cases where they have other symptoms they are not managing electrolytes.

The surest way now for me to gain 3 pounds in 2 days is to slack on my ketoade lol."
keto,"Sure, that's not what I was talking about in my comment but if you're just adding that one then cool, I'm also not sure which one you're talking about"

keto,"3.6 net carbs per 100g. So if you had 30g of string beans that's about 1 gram of carbs.

Personally I try to keep as many vegetables a possible a possibility in my diet. I don't really care if I go to 25g instead of 20g because I ate (for example) a few beans, because they're healthy. The point of the diet is to be healthier and the more you restrict the harder it is. Potato is a different story but we need our greens!"
keto,Thank you so much! Also do you count calories and macros or just macros?  l noticed how much calorie should be for each category but I just wanna know if it‚Äôs going to make a big difference if I stick to those.
keto,"Look up bodyweight exercises on you tube, no equipment required just your own weight and a good place to start. Resistance bands are useful too.

She only ate one meal a day 1400 calories (which seems hard to do because most of my meals on keto so far have been no more than 800 calories in total so I think I would personally die from trying to eat 1400 in one meal). She probably weighed around my weight or 280 I don‚Äôt really remember honestly. In total she‚Äôs lost 130 in 7 months then she started eating more meals but still does fasting after the 4 month mark so now her weight loss isn‚Äôt as fast. She‚Äôs losing 10lbs/ month at this point i think.

keto,"Believe it or not, weights and resistance training has more benefit in some ways.

Cardio is great for cardiovascular health, and I force myself to do it several times a week.

But lifting weights has different and in some ways more benefit. First off it helps build and maintain bone density, critical in old chocks like me but something every chick should pay attention to.

Second, building lean muscle mass increases you metabolism 24/7. Muscle burns slightly more calories than fat. 

Third, building new muscle really helps with body recomposition over time, and can really help with range of motion and such when you are old like me. Never hurts to start young either.

I currently do body weight exercises of one kind or another daily at home, no gym at the moment since we just moved a few months ago.

I also take a long walk with hubby several times a week. 

HIIT is a good thing when you have lost a good amount of weight since it really works well, but my doc told me not to go that route until I lost my weight to protect my joints. Young folks can get away with stuff I can't apparently.

Any consistent activity will do something for you. Manual labor, heavy cleaning, rearranging furniture... The trick is find excuses to move you actually like so you want to do them.

I despise exercise, always have. And I can tell you doing it when you hate it sucks rocks. Now if I could talk hubby into dance lessons I would be a happy camper lol."
keto,"Haha no, it's almost like, and I have no idea if this is what's actually happening, but it's almost like there's bacteria in me that's calling for the sugar/carbs but I poop them out when I take a dump."
keto,"The way that I see it, most of the high carb foods are just garbage anyway so why go back like that is normal? People try to make you feel like you are being weird not to eat potatoes, rice, and bread, but maybe eating those types of things all the time is the reason why everyone is overweight. Maybe just try adding a little fruit and see how that goes, and then adding back some higher carb veggies. Sorry if this sounds like a rant! I‚Äôm just trying to get it straight in my mind too as I‚Äôm where you are in this journey."
keto,"Okay I see some  red flags:

1. On TikTok...already enough reason to suspect that you aren't getting the full and truthful story.
2. Lost 100 lbs in 4-5 months? Unless they started at 400+ lbs, I find that claim very dubious!

I'm not saying you'll for sure have lose skin. 

I know someone who has very little especially considering he lost over 100 lbs in his late 50s!

Genetics really does play a big role in it, so, unfortunately, you just don't know until you get there.

Working out and incorporating fasting and collagen supplementation can also help a bit. 

I've also heard that dermarolling can help.

I'm just saying, though, take what you see on social media with a grain of salt."

keto,"No need to limit protein if you are not treating a protein sensitive condition like kidney disease or epilepsy. More protein is quite alright.

As to the organic etc., the actual nutrient and fat profile difference between organic, range fed, pasture fed, and the like is very low. About half my meat is entirely range fed and finished, the other half standard meat. But standard meat spends over 80 percent of its life cycle on range, grass or pasture and is only grain finished, that is why it is cheap.

I live in cow country now so I have more access to local meats, which is nice. They are a better quality and taste than the range cattle in Arizona for sure.

If in the USA and close to your state university's agricultural extension check there. When I lived in Tucson and was too broke to buy a quarter or half of a cow, we shopped at the U of As butcher shop. The meat was pasture raised on site and butchered by the students."

keto,Shitting through the eye of a needle.
keto,This!
keto,What do you normally eat?
keto,"That's one reason. The other two are that it's expensive to get the same calorie content out of actual meat vs lard. And, that there's usually a high protein to fat ratio. I get plenty of protein with this diet, but want to make sure my intake is 70-80% fat. 

To gain weight, I need around 3500 calories a day, I just can't get that on meat/veggies/fish/nuts alone, and maintain ketosis."

I recommend to skip the booze entirely for a while to just maybe exclude it as the root cause.

I have also found I sleep more deeply and longer if I eat all my carbs in one meal late evening.

When I want a good long sleep I make 1 large pot of beef or chicken stew with all 20g net carbs in it and stuff myself. And yes, those 20g net carbs will be carefully weighed potatoes, leeks, carrots and a little barley. And shredded cabbage.

keto,Good for you. I have friends who put their autistic sons on a keto like diet and they faired very well on it. I think it has a lot to do with good clean eating.
keto,"Short term goals are important. They help track your progress as well as the safety element of telling you in you are losing weight too quickly

I'm not a doctor but from what I understand, your body takes quite a while to build up your levels of vitamin d when you're deficient. The amount you can absorb is also rather high so it's difficult to have too much. I would take a vitamin/multivitamin that contains it and add some into your diet. I believe fish has vitamin d and oily fish can help lower cholesterol levels. Once again though, I'm not a doctor so also look into these things to double check."
keto,"As I understood it, subtract fibre from total carbs and get net carbs.   
Net carbs being the ""bad"" carbs that trigger insulin and all kinds of adverse health issues.  
Fibre is safely ignored from a ketogenic point of view since humans do not metabolize it, it does however affect our bowel movements and possibly also the biota. 

I'd say 50g/day net carbs is a very good target to start with. Give your body some time to adjust (it takes some time to change the metabolism) and when you have gotten used to it see how you feel by halving that.

I don't know what effect adding ketones has but ketosis is more it than just amount of ketones i your system. It will very likely lower your own production, which is literally counterproductive, specially when you're trying to adopt. As I recall the body discards a lot ketones in the beginning as well, not sure why. I deem it counterproductive and a waste of money.

I don't know what electrolytes are but as long as they're low carb and feel good I' say go for it :)

I would suggest multivitamins, Omega 3, sodium n magnesium in the beginning, as the body will need some extra nutrients during the metabolic transformation.   
I'd carry some carb backup like sweets or raisins or something to get blood sugar up in case it goes to low - whoosiness and fainting can be inconvenient.

Disclaimer; only medical training I have is first aid."
keto,I‚Äôm proud of you too:) Your victory helped me smile after my rubbish day; thank you.
keto,"Just by dome vitamin D, I take it every other day or so myself. Most people are deficient in it.

Breakfast: Cheese + bacon or ham
Lunch: Big salad - at least four cups of romaine lettuce, tomatoes, shredded cheese, avocado, favorite dressing.
Dinner: any sort of meat, up to 8 oz; side salad, vegetable, such as cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, etc.
Snacks:  most of the time nuts and or cheese. Sometimes I will have pork rinds. One of my favorites is to take a piece of cheese and wrap it in some sort of lunch meat from the deli.

Anyway, mix it up anyway you can semicolon I tend to stay away from the "" keto "" special foods like keto tortillas and keto bread and keto special whatever. I will rarely eat a keto tortilla, I will rarely have a piece of Sola keto bread. I do keep some premier protein chocolate shakes in the refrigerator as an emergency go to.

keto,"Magnesium deficiency is a common cause of stress, anxiety, and sleep problems, as well as hypertension and a host of other issues.

https://drhyman.com/blog/2010/05/20/magnesium-the-most-powerful-relaxation-mineral-available/

A leading physician researcher on the subject of Mg advises that the common serum lab test for Mg is almost useless in detecting common Mg deficiency.   Apparently serum is the last place a deficiency shows up, so tissue may be very deficient while serum testing will show a false negative for deficiency.  There are more accurate tests, such as cell testing, but such tests are expensive, hard to find, and often not covered by insurance.  This leads some to simply ensure adequate usable Mg intake, but it can be challenging.   The researcher advises that it can take many months of judicious supplementation with well absorbed Mg to overcome a deficiency and most give up quickly before any benefit is reached.   He also advises that it is best to take small doses of well absorbed Mg several times per day, as excess in one session is simply dumped and not used by the body.  

Cardiologist William Davis MD has an article for very inexpensive DIY magnesium water that is well absorbed and in my experience, tastes very good, surprisingly.   

https://www.wheatbellyblog.com/2020/05/magnesium-water-step-by-step/

Common drug store Mg supplements in the form of Mg oxide are very poorly absorbed, almost useless per the researcher."

keto,"I breastfeed on keto, but my daughter was a year old when I started. The biggest thing is to wait until your supply has regulated (4-5 months for most) to try any diet or calorie restriction since even small deficits can impact supply. You also need something like 500+ extra calories a day (20cal/oz) to support milk supply and that might be really hard to get on keto bc of appetite suppression. I followed a traditional higher carb diet for my daughter's younger months until I was brave enough to try keto and I was eating like 2300 calories a day with some weight loss. In most nutrition circles keto is counterindicated for BF, but honestly I don't see a problem as long as your milk supply is good (and if it drops, eat more, drink more water!)"

Honestly I don't feel any different. I resumed my normal keto diet today without a problem.

&gt; It sounds like your post-workout meal might more easily be in the form of a protein shake? That could get past that aversion to fat after working out and not mess up your progress.

I could but the sheer amount of calories I wanted to replace would make this pretty unrealistic, which is why I opted (or try to) for more fat-heavy food."

That said, if you are not at a deficit of calories you are not losing weight.  You will maintain or gain, even on keto. 

I would go lower calories and not worry now about your metabolism slowing much.  The exercises help keep that going too.  

Remember you may ingest less, but your body will take the extra it needs from your own body.  Mostly from fat stores.  It is eating all it needs.  Unless you are super lean."

I make a batch of pink salt and NoSalt mixture at a 3:1 ratio and then use a tsp of this mixture in 32oz water and Mio to taste.   I drink 2 of these over the course of the day.  It can vary too, if I've had a really hard, sweaty run, I take in a bit more.   This amount is where I feel best and don't get charley horse cramps or keto flu like issues.  ( Tired, headache, crabby).   I think everyone has different requirements when it comes to electrolytes.  You will just have to experiment with how you feel to see what your level is.  It changes over time too.   I require less now than at the beginning.   
My weight loss has been very steady since the initial water weight loss.   I had a few nice ""whooshes"" of 3 or 4 pounds in a week, but mostly it was around a pound a week.  Sometimes less, sometimes more.  Hormones cause a lot of fluctuation monthly too.   You really have to take a long range view of weight loss.   I weigh weekly, record it then forget it.   About every 8 weeks I do an average.   That's been a better way for me to see overall weight trends.   
My sleep has improved so much as well.  I don't snore or stop breathing anymore- so hubby tells me.   
I would say my energy levels are vastly improved from the previous me.   But I was just barely getting through the day at that point. I have plenty of daily energy now. Like, what I think a normal person should have. I have really high energy days where I have to move or go crazy.  Running helps me get that out in a constructive way.  Love that feeling."
keto,"Yup, I add 1g of salt per 0.5l of water I drink during the exercise, this should pretty much meet the salt that's lost through perspiration."
keto,"How tall are you?  Unless you are quite short, you don't have a lot of weight to lose, which is always more of a challenge, especially in the beginning and especially for women.

Also, have you taken your measurements?  Any changes there?"
keto,Just make up the nutrition part during lunch or dinner. Tons of people just straight up fast until lunch anyway.
keto,"Cool, thanks for the speedy and detailed reply :)"
keto,Always hydrate first - salty water. Then choose the meal. After a workout you do need salt.
keto,"Yes, I used to take my coffee with three teaspoons of sugar and milk. Now I take it black and I don't think I could go back to sweet coffee. Tea was more difficult because I loved sweet tea, but I'm getting used to the different flavours now, I greatly enjoy the ones with bergamot and spices, like chai."
keto,"I have always heard higher carbs helps with milk production. I didn't attempt keto until my baby was 14 months and was only nursing in the morning. But I can tell you it seemed like whatever I was producing for her seemed to dry up within a few weeks of starting keto. She was frustrated one morning and kept signing ""more"" and then we sort of just stopped nursing and she is fine. 
I guess it depends on how important breastfeeding is to you. If it stops your milk production, would you mind?"
keto,"I would say heavy cream, but since you drink 4 cups a day, that would be too many calories.  That is something you'd have to pay attention to with any milk substitute as well - quantity matters as well as the carb count.

If you can see your way clear to reduce your coffee consumption and maybe switch to tea after a cup, then the cream could fit in well.  That's what I do.  One cup of coffee in the morning, plain tea the rest of the day."
keto,"For my sweet tooth I make chocolate mousse with double cream, coco powder, sugar substitute,  vanilla, and coconut cream.. i whisk the double cream until its thick add a table spoon of unsweetened coco, a tspoon of vanilla, .. and the cream from a tin of creamed coconut, I add 3-4 tablespoons of your sweetner of choice .. whisk it all together chill for an hour or so.. then have a big spoon full everytime you need a sweet fix.. its creamy and delicious .. (if it's to thick just add a drop of unwhisked cream or the water left over from the creamed coconut ) it takes about 5 or 10 mins and will keep for a few days in the fridge .. try it it's so yummy xxx"
keto,Cashew milk is much creamier than almond milk. If you don't want to drink so many calories from Heavy Cream. Obviously doesn't taste as good. But it's aight. Macadamia Milk is also better than almond imo.
keto,"Rule 2: Stay on topic. Off topic posts include: cheat posts, posts about other diets/others that are not eating keto, ""farewell"" posts, **posts asking how to stop keto and resume a ""normal"" diet**, etc. 

Off topic discussions will only be allowed in the Daily Community Support Thread."
keto,"i am breastfeeding and have been doing keto for about a month. i have not noticed any changes in my supply. my baby is almost 10 months old though, so i did wait until my supply was well established before i started keto. frankly i wasn't mentally ready yet to give up the carbs haha! i did keto pre pregnancy as well and then gained 70 pounds while pregnant, agh. but now i've lost about 50 of those pounds since having the baby! (about 10 since starting keto)

my personal suggestion would be to wait 3 months or so before starting, and get out of the newborn phase first. when i started breastfeeding it was like literally 50% of my day nursing her. by 3 months in she was much faster and didn't need to nurse so often. but of course that is just one person's experience, and everyone is unique! i have zero credentials to back my opinion, just my one experience lol. 

best of luck to you, and congrats!"
keto,"Are you in the US? My local nutrition store has a pretty nice scale/body comp analyzer, and can use it whenever I want. It stores your history and generates a report each time. I know it‚Äôs not super accurate, but I can see the clear trend in the right direction."
keto,"One thing that I use to kill my sweet tooth is hot tea, I drink a georgia peach tea with some stevia and kills my sweet cravings"
keto,How long is your ride? What's your nutrition while you ride? How did you feel while you rode? Is this the first time you've had this feeling?
keto,"You might like a book called ""always hungry?""

The testimonials in it are quite obnoxious but the information outlining a transition method could be useful to you."
keto,Thanks for sharing. I will check in if I am able to see if your doctors can isolate your keto affects.
keto,"Collagen doesn't *subtract* from your protein, so ""making up"" for it is pointless."
keto,"That‚Äôs just how I was shown to do Keto. Helps keep in ketosis, and if need be, creates a buffer. My lunch is 1g of net carbs every day (triple cheese burger) and then for dinner it varies on what the family eats. We had a nutritionist come in one day (Army) as part of a holistic health class (15 day course) and that‚Äôs the way she taught us. Her husband does keto that way, and it works."
keto,"Well, it can take up to 9 weeks being ketogenic to become fully fat adapted.  Circulating in and out of ketosis will prevent that adaptation."
keto,"That varies a lot based on personal preference and what you're trying to accomplish with the bar.  For me, my favorite is the Quest Hero bars.  They have the macros I prefer and taste amazing."
keto,I eat the 90% dark chocolate and used to think it tasted like chaulk. Now I love it and eat a piece or two every day to curb my sweet tooth.
keto,I‚Äôm curious why you don‚Äôt also subtract the sugar alcohols?
keto,"Dr. Eric Westman and Amy Berger have written a new book, End Your Carb Confusion, that has a very helpful chapter on how to transition from ketogenic levels of carb restriction after your achieve your goals without sabotaging your progress.  It has a helpful chart of questions, the answers to which (that can be scored) help you decide whether and how much carbs you might add back into your diet."
keto,"Premier Protein shake.  I like Cafe Latte because it adds the creaminess without really impacting the coffee flavor a lot but for those who like actual flavor in their creamer, the Cinnamon Roll and Caramel are both quite good in coffee."
keto,"Unfortunately there was.

But I have an appointment with my endocrinologist next Monday so I can't be sure what's happening. When we first met two months ago he told me I was taking too much levo so he lowered my dose (100mcg x5 and 75mcg x2), all my results (TSH, T3 and T4) where in the normal ranges that time.

Now my TSH and T3 are low (TSH  way under normal range, T3 not so much) so I really don't know what happened (I have three variables to consider, levo, metformin and keto diet). If you like you could ask me next week what my doc says about it. The only symptom I was having was increased sleep and noticing less stamina during my exercise.

edit: a word"
keto,"I actually stated using this [snack](https://imgur.com/gallery/kihrLFD). I count it as 4 carbs as I follow Total carbs minus dietary fiber to get net carbs. My local Walmart stocks them, or you can get them on Amazon.

Edit, added a space between this, and the Snack link."

keto,Good idea!!!
keto,Good advice. I‚Äôm going to pick up some body fat calipers start tracking that. It‚Äôs definitely having an impact it‚Äôs just hard to know what LOL
keto,Ok. Upping my protein is good news   Should I lower my fat to keep my calories at the same amount?
keto,I think you are right. I‚Äôm kind of an all or nothing gal. Trying to moderate isn‚Äôt for me!
keto,"I personally disagree, as I've been living on a carb-heavy diet all my life, but I'll agree that switching to keto made me less hungry, which helped me not gain weight while i've been recovering from injury and could not exercise."
keto,There wasn‚Äôt any change to your hypothyroidism was there? My wife takes levo every morning for her hypothyroidism as well. Wonder if it might help and possibly reduce the need to medicate.
keto,"Thanks for understanding! I feel like if I went back to carbs it‚Äôll just get worse. I‚Äôm convinced that maybe I just haven‚Äôt done keto right. I would have insane amounts of diet soda and fake sugars, like an addict. Lots of people are telling me to trust the process. But thank you for understanding I truly appreciate the support"
keto,"I put 1g of salt per 0.5l of water. I weigh myself before and after exercise to make sure I drink enough, so I don't think it was that."
keto,"Yes I agree it‚Äôs not the worst, I‚Äôm just afraid that I will keep going. Also, I am going to try eating veggies. I like to keep it simple so I‚Äôll just have a bunch of spinach. Thanks for the advice I appreciate it!"
keto,I'm sold
keto,"Give it some time. I try to use pics and measurements instead of the scale these days. Lifting with keto has been helping me build muscle and cut body fat. I‚Äôve done several body scans and it confirms more LBM, less fat. I still want to see the number drop on my scale, but seeing abs come in makes that number pretty irrelevant."
keto,It's like milk but milkier.
keto,"Yup, suplementing electrolytes as per the faq, and I add 1g of salt per 0.5l of water I drink during the exercise, which should be about the same concentration as is lost with perspiration. I weigh myself before and after to make sure I drink enough fluids."
keto,"Thank you! Would you say the ‚Äúmetallic‚Äù taste is a good thing? I felt it for the first time yesterday, but I still ate a lot."
keto,"&gt; You don't need to eat a huge amount of fat on keto, in fact if you goal is to loose weight you want to limit your fat intake so that the body burns your fat not the fat your eating.

Sorry if that wasn't clear, I don't need to lose any weight, in fact I started with keto in order to avoid gaining weight while I was recovering from injury.

I went for the fatty foods in order to replenish the calories I lost during exercise, as I stated in the post."
keto,I like frozen yogurt bars
keto,"You might want to think about alternate day fasting if your insulin is being stubborn. I lose a lot more weight when I alternate between omad and 2mad. A lot of ADF people do longer windows than that, but I don't have the discipline."
keto,"Without trying to wrap my head around all the different processes, and how they might influence each other, I will say that my first thought is *'too many chefs in the kitchen'.* I don't think you will reap the full benefits with this approach.

But I should prefix this by saying that I am quite literally obeying to a reverse form of this diet.  I follow a cyclical keto diet, with one carb day, followed by one full fast day."
keto,The food I meal prep is weighed on a food scale
keto,Yes
keto,Get some plain pork rinds and then lightly pour lemon juice over them. It makes them sooooo much better.
keto,"I thought that was the case for me, but then I remembered I hate my job."
keto,"You started working out and gaining muscle, that's what you did ""wrong""."
keto,"I did something similar... my wife and I were at Target and I brought her a 40-pound barbell and asked her to hold it. As she struggled to hold it with both hands, I told her that's how much weight I lost."
keto,"So I am only unhappy because of the failure of lose weight. If I was successful at this I won't be unhappy anymore. Maybe depressed was too strong a word to use.  Wd you still say I need to see a mental health counselor?

I wdnt say I am an emotional eater either even when I am not on this diet I eat regular portions to be honest many around me wonder why I wd diet at all coz my regular way of eating isn't really unhealthy yet I am still overweight. When I say I miss carbs I just mean I miss eating my 2 slices of bread and 1 cup serving of rice, not that I ever really overate any of that high carb food in the first place. Wd you still say I sd still see a mental health counselor?"
keto,"I found a website called ""easydiets.online"" that will make this really easy for you"
keto,Yes I see that as well. I was advised not to go below 1500 because it would ‚Äústall out my metabolism.‚Äù Should I aim for 1300 each day then?
keto,"I'm kinda experiencing the same thing. Sleeping like a rock, waking up later. Feeling good though."
keto,"I saw a website called ""easydiets.online"" that could help with this"
keto,"The scale doesn‚Äôt tell the whole story‚Äîsince you are lifting and doing cardio, you‚Äôre probably building muscle, which is a good thing. I‚Äôve been running and working out and while the pounds didn‚Äôt fall off as much as I‚Äôd like, I look better, feel better, and am getting stronger. Some take measurements rather than go by the scale. 

Keep up the great work and don‚Äôt be discouraged!"
keto,"Hi! I'm pretty sure I'm about to be diagnosed with diabetes, so I'm starting on keto. I'm getting to grips with most of it, I'm just wondering if there is something I can use in place of bread/crisps for dipping into sauces. It makes for an easy lunch! I've seen that carrots aren't particularly low in carbs, and I hate celery more than any other food so is there something else that doesn't need preparation?"
keto,So about 10 days in on high protein keto. Net carbs consistently under 20g per day and with a 20% calorie deficit scale doesn‚Äôt seem to be moving at all. I‚Äôm in solid ketosis and looking and feeling good. Maybe I just need to bag the scale. IDK.
keto,Herbal tea.
keto,"You may want to recheck your macros.  At your stats with sedentary and 20% deficit your calories should be @1300 or lower. 

I would not add calories yet, unless you want to gain weight. 

Do focus on getting close to your protein so you can better replace lost muscle."
keto,"Sure; but my point is that I prefer to be extemporaneous, and this approach helps me do it without risking going over my net carbs. If it doesn‚Äôt address a problem you yourself face, then you don‚Äôt need to consider it :)  I posted this for folks who might have the same issue as me."
keto,"Tell me about electrolytes.... I didn‚Äôt feel great the first week, but got through it. I am salting my food with Himalayan salt. 
I have 4 kids, 1 in college , a senior, freshman and 5th grade. 
I think I could definitely not eat after 8 pm and wait for lunch. 

One thing I have noticed is I am sleeping incredibly! 

I can‚Äôt say that I have incredible energy, but I am not fatigued the way I was when I first started. 

Do you lose faster once you are fat adapted?"
keto,It's not like you absolutely have to eat what you'd planned the day/week/whatever before. I plan my meals in advance but often just change my log as I go. But whatever is easier for you.
keto,"Hi I am female and trying to lift weights too. The FAQ for this board would probably recommend that continue to try to lose body fat until you're around 24% body fat. I always keep my carb manager at sedentary when trying to lose weight, 

If you were lifting weights and are  able to increase your calories while still meeting your goals of losing weight, then you should continue to do that. I always found that I had to lose all the weight first and then build muscle back up. After those initial muscle gains, It's harder to lose weight and gain muscle at the same time. Also lifting weights makes me hungry!

keto,"Great write-up and so good to read you took a proactive approach. Take back the reigns over your body and life in your own hands friend, because what you have written down sure doesn't sound healthy to me. You sound very sacrificial - you should be able to sleep in a bed. Hopefully the reduced weight will also reduce the snoring."

keto,Supplemening electrolytes up to the levels recommended in the FAQ should cover there extra dumped electrolyte
keto,"&gt; I was eating 1200 calories for the first two day with no results and upped my calories to 1400-1550.

Why would you up your calories if you didn't see any results? Eating more surely won't make you lose weight any faster"
keto,For me it was one month before my weight started dropping. 9 days is nothing

You can also specify EU labelling. A much better app for people in the EU (or formerly in the EU... alas.)

Highly recommended."

keto,"Pickled cucumbers, keto cheesecake, peanut butter protein bar, boiled egg, veggies with peanut sauce, keto cinnamon rolls, and plenty of cheese."
keto,The peanut butter ones are absolute heaven! Sooooooo creamy.
keto,"Well I disagree, I don't think it's very clear when it's not explicitly labled on the front of the box.  Look up ""sued for nut allergies"" it's a big problem for folks.  Things like frozen pizza aren't prone to nut ingredients, I think it's reasonable to expect explicit labels.  But it's fine if you disagree, there's obviously the self-responsibility element etc I understand all that."
keto,"Question for experienced keto folk:

I'm five weeks in and both hunger and appetite have just vanished.

Before I was still getting hungry around meal time but I'm now just not. It's resulting in a very low kcal intake for the past five days.

Did you go through this?"
keto,"Daaamn,youre awesome...I started keto again last week cause i fucked up my weight again...after i lost 25kgs.THIS time im NOT going to screw up."
keto,happy cake day!
keto,"What timings for intermittent fasting are you following? I currently fast between 20:00 and 12:00, but interested to get other people's schedules (as I may be over/underdoing it."
keto,About 5-10 mins a day. Omad is the key. 5-10 mins is actually time i spend in a kitchen. Once it's in the owen/ on the pan i go do my stuff.
keto,"Yep it can. Hubby went from a freight train to a golf cart, with an occasional snort here and there.

keto,"Use it always. Your food scale is your best friend.

I got derailed for almost 6 months once before keto. I was weighing everything except my ranch dressing lol. It turns out my ""tablespoon"" was more like 2 or 3...."
keto,Sounds delicious. I don‚Äôt meal prep. Meals are simple meat and veg. The odd more complex meal here and there.
keto,I make my own and it‚Äôs a pain but it‚Äôs just black tea and a little sugar
keto,There's a lot of options but I'd say hands down the easiest and most versatile is potatoes - you can cut potatoes into large chunks and boil them. Then she can mash them with a fork on the plate and add butter/salt. Pretty low effort and cheap as well. They are a great neutral side for pretty much any keto dinner and the chunks keep in the fridge and reheat pretty well.
keto,"I mostly drink Heath ade and it‚Äôs about 14-16 carbs a bottle. I drink it daily, but that‚Äôs probably my main and if not only carb I consume on most days . Without It would probably lose my mind. (Drank a lot of juice before keto) Going to get into making my own one of these days . I think it‚Äôs totally doable though. I have multiple family members on keto and we all drink it regularly if not daily."
keto,Ohhh and of course olives!
keto,"Things I just grab from the fridge/pantry to snack on:

- Any type of cheese
- Celery/cucumber sticks (dip in cream cheese)

Things I pre-cook in big batches that I snack on:

- Meatballs
- Tuna salad
- Hard boiled eggs

Hope this helps! üòã"
keto,"Your food scale is your best friend. 

Take it from somebody that lost weight and maintained the loss for months or years 3 times before keto...

Each time, life was great until I went idiot and thought I could eyeball portions. Well, my eyes grew and so did my stomach, just slowly enough that I could double down on idiot and blame it on water weight, aging, illness....

And sorry but myfitnesspal stinks. Cronometer is amazing. I started with MFP and ditched it after a few weeks due to inaccuracies. When you get as few calories as I get you need accurate."
keto,"Yes it can. On keto you'll get your energy from fat rather than carbs so eat lots of fat (like at least 80% of your macros). This will also help you gain weight. 

If you want to gain weight make sure you eat multiple times a day (say 6 -10). This is one of the reasons people in the west are so fat. They eat breakfast lunch and dinner plus snacks on top so end up eating 6-10 times a day. You can use this knowledge to help you gain weight"
keto,Congratulations ; but still the main problem how you go so far on keto
keto,"No worries. When I was in a losing phase and now maintaining, I have blown my calories now and then. I just move on, and make it a point to check stuff in advance if I am not cooking it.

One high day here and there isn't a big deal. Better to blow the calories than the carbs!

In fact, I blew mine today lol. And I enjoyed it. Tomorrow I am back to eating my normal calories and it will likely be months before I do that again. I have maintained plus or minus 2 pounds well over a year now."
keto,"In the fridge I have prosciutto and mozzarella sticks, plain yogurt (Two Good brand), salads. My favorite is the keto pancakes or the breakfast biscuit I make to somewhat resemble McDonalds breakfast. I like cheese crisps, green olives, a almond milk with protein powder, raspberries. 
The only meal prep I really do anymore is the pancakes. It‚Äôs more time effective to do a large batch."
keto,"I noticed kombucha has a great deal of carbs, do you have low carb brands or do you make it yourself?"
keto,"Most of the initial weight-loss is 'water weight', which is a depletion of glycogen in the body which water attached itself to. If you go high carb your body will store glycogen and the water that goes with it."
keto,There's a keto japan sub reddit you may want to check out. It is almost impossible to eat out in Japan if you're low carb though.
keto,"Pickles and protein. My go to on the rare occasion I snack is a pickle spear wrapped in deli meat with mustard.

And getting your electrolytes nailed can kill the snack urge. As can flavored waters, teas, broth with spices...

You can eat all you wish within your macros. I have a really low calorie limit, so I don't have a lot of options. But you might try going for a high volume of low cal foods. Lean meats, large salad, whatever. Weigh out all you can fit in your macros for the day in the morning or night before. Then see how you can distribute it to fit what you want to do in terms of eating.

It also helps to distract yourself since a lot of snacking and eating is from boredom rather than actual hunger."
keto,"You don't need them to do keto. Here's what I ate yesterday.

\- 3 egg omelette with Spanish chorizo, spinach and mushrooms.

\- Salmon with cauliflower mash and asparagus cooked in garlic and butter.

Here's what I'm eating today:

\- Cheddar and broccoli soup.

\- Chicken wrapped in parma ham with brussell sprouts, fried onions, mushrooms and red pepper.

&amp;#x200B;

Other things I eat are cheesy broccoli, fried halloumi, peppered steak, blackbean spaghetti, chia seed pudding. Sometimes I'll just hard boil too eggs and pair it with leftover meat from the day before.

While I recommend avoiding processed meats where possible due to high nitrate content, if you're not allergic to meat, eggs, cheese or green vegetables, you'll be fine on keto."
keto,Thanks for sharing :)
keto,"Maybe because you still use it lol. Throw the dang people scale in the closet for a while and rely on things that matter. Your food scale, accurate macros, improving fitness, dropping inches and clothing sizes are what counts.

People scales suck rocks. But people get fixated on those magic numbers. But what does that number mean? NOTHING really. Increasing fitness, good mental state, feeling happy in clothes or in your skin mean much more.

You are not a number. You are a person, and everything you mentioned is worth celebrating. At some point a scale number will be added to that list. But it is the other stuff that matters. 

Sometimes reducing amazing shit to one small thing isn't a good idea."
keto,Pickles!
keto,Good work ; I am trying to lose my overweight by low carb diet
keto,"Body recomposition. I have been maintaining for over a year now and I still drop random inches and clothing sizes as I get more physically fit.

Muscle is more dense than fat, so the same pounds in muscle as fat take up less room."
keto,"What worked for me was planning cheat days. I also like going out to eat about once a month, so we usually go somewhere I can get steak and salad, a bunless burger, or a butter chicken. However, I give myself a break 6 times a year. My birthday, my husband's birthday, our anniversary, and 3 days over Christmas. I tend to just break keto for the main meal when we go out for a fancy dinner and have a big decedent dessert. Next day - back on the wagon.

In terms of drinking, I have gin and soda, whiskey neat, or I just have one or two low carb beers and try to factor them into my macros for the day. My one caution about that is wait until you are fat adapted before incorporating alcohol, as you'll bounce back faster and are also less likely to sabotage yourself if you accidentally stray up over the 20g. Also, don't drink on consecutive days. It'll really mess with your ketosis."
keto,"Good for you! Stick with it. I have for over 2 years since my diagnosis and my T2d has been fully controlled with no meds. 

Along with a lot of other things."
keto,"I cycle 10 miles every weekday morning as a faux commute - I work from home. I also cycle 10 miles almost every weekday evening with my daughter after school - on a Friday we do a 25 mile cycle. On a Saturday morning we cycle off road. My morning cycles are all fasted, and the 25 mile cycle is also fasted (now).

The key thing that I have learnt is that:

- fat adaption is great for endurance; there is no wall to hit
- I can cycle 25 miles fasted (only recently discovered this!)
- electrolytes are extremely important, especially when exercising

During the 25 mile cycle I started to notice that my performance was dropping and I was getting thirsty. Because I generally don‚Äôt take water with me on the shorter rides, I had not done this I the longer ride. Next time out I took water with electrolytes and drank as I needed it. Performance was up (6 PRs out of 30 sections) and I felt like I could have kept going.

A month ago I was concerned that I might need to eat more carbs as I was cycling so much (you hear this sort of advice) but I was cautious. I bought a Freestyle Libre 2 Continuous Glucose Monitor and wore that for 2 weeks. My blood glucose was pretty regular (4.8mmol/l) over the day, dipping slightly overnight (4.4mmol/l). This was for two weeks, whilst continuing to exercise. That reassured me that I didn‚Äôt need to supplement - but this is personal, and you might be different."
keto,"Not OP, but mine were tingling and numbing in my feet, vision changes and peeing all the time at night. 

I also had persistent fungal infections. Feet, toenails, mouth. I was between regular appointments when the symptoms began to be noticeable. Went in for blood work, A1c was 7.1 up from a flat 6 2 months before. 

Coincidentally the test came back 2 days after I had started keto. So, I did some research, and stayed keto. Over 2 years now, A1c is a flat 5 and has been practically the whole time."
keto,"Not OP, but diabetes is a sneaky disease. A lot of people don't have alarming symptoms for years, that is why it is usually diagnosed so late.
As per actual symptoms - tingling in arms and legs, fatigue, maybe acanthosis nigricans, hypertension, maybe a lot of peeing, infections that won't go away or they come back as soon as one stops treatment
If a person is obese, always check blood glucose. It's an inexpensive and readily available test that can reveal a potential diagnosis."
keto,Well done!!!!!
keto,Sashimi the shit out of everything
keto,What symptoms did you experience that made you think you had diabetes before going to the doctor?
keto,"That's super easily done.
I am in month 5, started at 230, weight about 177 now."
keto,"Damn, can I come by for dinner? For real tho, can you post your recipes?"
keto,I always hear muscle is more dense than fat theory and yes this is true. But you would have to be packing on some major amount of muscle to be keeping that scale even. You can‚Äôt tell me some one swapped out 20 lbs of fat for 20 lbs of muscle in three months. I mean maybe...? But this has to be the exception and not the rule. So sure you added a couple lbs of muscle on over a course of a year that‚Äôs legitimate but what I really think is going on is your body is going through a very serious transformation and is probably grasping on to every ounce of water it can.
keto,I only use lite salt.  I‚Äôm glad you are feeling better.  Let me know if you have more questions.
keto,That's an assload of coffee.
keto,"Thanks! And yeah, potassium has helped a lot already."
keto,"&gt;I stopped using MyFitnessPal because I found several inaccurate entries for foods I ate regularly like steaks etc.

It's a pain, but you can make your own food items on there. It's what I do. What do you use now?"
keto,"Good advice, I‚Äôll keep it in mind."
keto,"Took a potassium supplement and already feel much better, thank you. I‚Äôll probably end up grabbing some lite salt for more regular use. Are there any other supplements you use/would recommend?"
keto,It's happening right now with my boyfriend! We both started Keto about a week ago and he completely stopped snoring.

keto,"It's been a little over 5 weeks since the blood draw for the A1c test that put me into the diabetes range for the first time. Tomorrow, I'm going in for my first follow-up with my PCP since the diagnosis.

I'm not scheduled for another A1c test for another 2 months though."
keto,"The rule of thumb should be: if it has calories, it breaks your fast."
keto,"The bast way to do keto in my personal experience is to stick with fats and cruciferous vegetables. Stick with 2 meals within 8 hours and allow 16 hours of no food. ( not including water, tea, limited coffee intake) I do not limit my meals, I eat until full and so far in 4 months I have lost 30lb without exercise... I need to drop 10 more lb but that will require more effort like going back to the gym..."
keto,"On the news today , a woman at least 100 lbs overweight was saying how she‚Äôs tired all the time . She‚Äôs blaming covid and it being long haul . I wanted to scream at the tv , Anyone carrying that much fat around would be tired all the time ! Try weight loss !"
keto,Was a nice video to watch. Though I'm a bit confused that he listed onions as an okay thing to eat regularly. Aren't onions high carb?
keto,"I appreciate this kind of input, but I've only been on keto for a week and I'm still learning. Trying to adjust but it's not that easy to just break a lifetime of bad eating habits. 

I know what the goal is, I was looking for advice on what I can snack on throughout the day when I would normally eat something bad. A few slices of lettuce? Strawberries? Is there really nothing I can sneak in after dinner every day?"
keto,"You were beautiful before and you're beautiful now! What's important is that YOU are happy with your transformation, keep going!"
keto,"Appreciate this response. Some people just don't get it that it's hard to go from having a snacks throughout the day to just not. I tried celery, sadly I couldn't enjoy the taste of it. Having a few pieces of lettuce might do the trick if that's okay, I'll try that."
keto,"I just learnt it the hard way. Not only did I get drunk more quickly, but the next day I got one of the worst hangovers of my life. I have been on keto for just 3 weeks. On the bright side, going out for drinks will be a lot cheaper."
keto,"Daily macros haven't been a problem, normally below on cal, carbs, fat, and good on protein so I'll go ahead and add it in actually. I found an article that talks about MCT oil and fasting, wasn't about keto but just IF and it looks like they say its acceptable. I mean it's supposed to produce more ketones so might stop it for a tiny bit, but help in the long run. Ty for your help!

keto,"I tried it once. The package I got had a couple of different flavors. They were completely undrinkable for me. Way too sweet, way too salty, and just entirely unpleasant.

I still have the shaker bottle they provided, though. That has been pretty useful over the years. I threw the Keto Chow away from trying two flavors, though. There is no way I could drink that stuff. It honestly made me gag trying to get it down."
keto,"Technically yes. Honestly, since you're not fasting for the long term benefits of fasting a little mct oil shouldn't hurt as long as it fits your daily Macros"
keto,Thank you so much! I wish you luck too! We got this!! I will say it is quite hard to hit a certain amount of fat it‚Äôs far easier for me to just load up on protein
keto,Lookin good. Keep it up. You‚Äôre doin great!
keto,12 raw eggs in a shake? Isn't this a fast track to salmonella?
keto,"Protein is a target - you should try to hit that number. Fat is a ceiling- you can go up to that number to be satiate. Carbs is also a ceiling - you can go up to that number, but should try to avoid going over. Obviously no ones perfect and you‚Äôre going to have days that you‚Äôre high/low on one or the other. I‚Äôm also in a similar boat, I‚Äôm only on day 2 of my second run at keto. I last 50lbs the first time but unfortunately gained them all back. Good luck!"
keto,"Gotcha, so pretty much anything I add to coffee that has calories would be considered breaking the fast. I'll just stick to coffee with some a packet of sweetner."
keto,"""MCT oil is a dietary supplement that is made up of MCT fats, which are fats that can be found in coconut oil, palm kernel oil, and dairy products."""
keto,"5lb a month is fine. Losing 5 too 10 lb per month is where you want to be. People lose 100 lb on keto, over a year. It takes some time. Stick with it."
keto,"As long as you keep your insulin low, which you are if you're doing keto, going over your max calories one day will have almost no effect. Don't worry about it. Don't make a habit of it, either, but it's really no big deal."
keto,"It was because of the 15 lbs weight loss, and me telling him that my glucose tests at home were normal range."
keto,I'm surprised your doctor tested your A1C only 5 weeks after the prior test. They usually wait 3 months between tests.

keto,"And the macros are what?

If that‚Äôs true, they‚Äôre in ketosis.

Excess blood ketones aren‚Äôt necessary."
keto,"I did keto after quitting smoking, so it wasn't super related, but I think there's also a connection between taking control of your life and habits. Like after I quit smoking, I was like, holy shit, I can actually control this beast of a body. It's very empowering."
keto,üëÜ
keto,Do you count your calories on keto and maintain deficit?
keto,"If you're interested in learning more about intermittent fasting, I can't recommend [THIS](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Guide-Fasting-Intermittent-Alternate-Day/dp/1628600012) book highly enough. Dr. Jason Fung is wonderful \~ you can also check him out on YouTube.

All best wishes to you!"
keto,"The keto diet was originally created to help reduce symptoms in individuals with epilepsy, it's not a diet for weight loss.

Keto is also popular with athletes and weight lifters. They are often trying to gain mass, not lose it.

If you want to lose weight, you need to count calories."
keto,Ill give it a look thank you!
keto,My Fitness Pal has a create a recipe feature
keto,I would suggest checking out r/ketogains and read the FAQ there.
keto,"You don‚Äôt need carbs for performance in your work outs, you need time for adaption, and electrolytes."
keto,congratulations !
keto,Broke into the sub 200 club today. 230 to 199.3 in 6 weeks. Feeling fucking great.
keto,Nice work I‚Äôm 80 lbs down about a year in I was at 270 still have a bit to go and some sculpting to do and muscle toning for sure but congrats üòÉ
keto,What about insulin resistance?
keto,Finally under 300lbs! 298.5 this morning. Lost 44.9 lbs so far!
keto,I take fluoxetine and had no trouble getting into ketosis by limiting net carbs to less than 20g a day.
keto,The carb count is below 20 some days even 12 net carb a day. Macros and food are on point.
keto,"Reducing your calories to a minimal level isn't the answer. Recalculate your macros at your new weight, and add in some exercise. I also stopped losing for a couple weeks. After recalculating and adding a 3-mile treadmill walk every day, the weight started moving down again."
keto,I meant higher carb lower fat. I should have been clearer sorry.
keto,Over 6 weeks.
keto,One meal a day.  A 46 hour fast is exactly what it sounds like. I was doing one meal a day so I had a two hour eating window. I would eat dinner Sunday night and then not eat again until dinner Tuesday night.
keto,Sounds like it may be muscle cramps. Increase your Magnesium and start taking potassium supplements. I take Mg in the evening and K+ am and pm. I have to take both or I get horrible cramps. Drink Gatorade Zero to increase your electrolyte intake if you can tolerate it. Sip bouillon and salt your food to taste. This is not a low sodium diet. Watch Dr. Stephen Phinney videos on You Tube to increase your knowledge. Good luck.
keto,"Cronometer has a great recipe feature and didn't fuck up their own user interface with a recent update like some others have. They also  have a fantastic and well managed food database and let you take pics of new items that don't exist in the database and autopopulate the nutritional facts to create a new entry on the fly. The only thing that sucks about Cronometer, which sucks in all tracking apps everywhere, is the macro calculator  in it. Use the calculator and directions in the FAQ to manually plug in your macros and you're all set."
keto,OMAD?? and what do you mean by a 46 hour fast?
keto,"Respect!!
You're literally less than half the man you used to be...I can appreciate how you must have felt when you started you keto journey. It wasn't going to be easy. And you probably wondered should I even try? But try you did. And you f@#king hit it out of the park!"
keto,Haha indeed it's very tasty! That's okay you deserve it! I know the feeling after losing 7 and a half stone (and a lot of ups and downs) I just want to stay the same! Yes exactly ;) keep it up! X
keto,I am currently using Carb Manager and it has been really helpful so far. Highly recommended.
keto,Have you tried high carb low fat(10-20%)? that works for some people.
keto,Exactly! And thanks!
keto,Thanks so much! I just downloaded Senza and I already love how clear the macro goals are.
keto,thank you!
keto,"Congratulations!!! That's absolutely amazing! 

Do you plan on donating/selling these 42s just as an actual gesture of saying goodbye to your 42 waist? I'm donating most of my old/bigger clothes as if saying I'm not coming back to them at all.üòä"
keto,Carbmanager.
keto,"How much do you weigh? I'm skinny, I kept getting palpitations despite eating about 600g of green leafy veggies each day and eating salt. 

My ldl had shot up 100 points. If your cholesterol is high, that could be causing your issue."
keto,There‚Äôs a Gary Taubes book called the case against sugar and a decent chunk of the book is about sugar and the tabco industry. From what is in the book sugar become a huge part of the Tabco industry as they soaked the leaves in sugar. His theory is that sugar is the main thing that makes smoking addictive as rates of smoking only start to accelerate once the sugar was added. So perhaps getting off sugar has helped you kick the other addiction. It‚Äôs a very interesting book.
keto,Thanks! Let's just keep going!üí™
keto,"Yes~~

I took some extra magnesium yesterday and noticed it helped a lot.

I realized that my PPI is probably causing a lack of absorption for this electrolyte (it made my b-12 low too).

So weaning off the PPI (I was anyway), and taking extra magnesium."
keto,"I am so happy for you. There is nothing better than putting on your ""skinny"" jeans and realizing you'll need new ""skinny"" jeans in the future."
keto,"One thing I noticed about keto, if your muscles get out of whack it's almost impossible to heal them on this diet, at least for me."
keto,"Hey I‚Äôm on week 3 and felt the SAME at week 1. My go to comfort food was just sweet bread with butter and I was really struggling without my sweet roll snack. 

I found [this recipe](https://www.ketoconnect.net/best-keto-bread/) for bread I really like and ended up slicing it very thin and making cucumber sandwiches. It absolutely satisfies my carb craving! I‚Äôm having zero issues staying under 20g net carbs and under 1500cal now and I can see myself eating like this for the rest of my life!

Same age (31) 5‚Äô 7‚Äù

keto,"Since he is on SSRI, he might be interested in knowing that HCLF can raise serotonin levels. So much so that they can cause low testosterone."
keto,"no that is raw weight not net protein, my net protein hovered around 50g or 60g but i was not doing any muscle building activity then"
keto,"There are a few that will do this.  I think most of the macro tracking apps have the capability.  I am currently using Senza so I know it does it, but Chronometer and Carb Manager probably do it as well."
keto,Reduce fat and up protein. That got me over a stall.
keto,"Powerade Zero has next to no value in terms of electrolytes. You may want to search the sub for ""ketoade"" recipes which will also ideally contain more potassium and/or magnesium."
keto,Google just like the real thing keto lasagna. It‚Äôs fantastic. I use the chicken crust pizza and love it. I tried the lasagne noodles as a pizza crust and it tasted good but didn‚Äôt crisp. Seasons the chicken crust however you want.
keto,"Not the scientific answer you are hoping for, but....

I think some of the answer here depends on what your dietary goals are.  For weight maintenance, eating the caloric total each 24 hours, or 7 x daily within the week.  If your goal is weight loss however, I would think that this type of schedule might be really conducive to an IF program.  There are people who routinely or semi-routinely fast for up to 48 hours or more.  So maybe IF is incorporated in some way that there is one big meal and the rest of that awake cycle becomes fasting time."
keto,"Measure, measure, measure! NSV's are SO big. I just completed week 2. I'm a 5'2 female that started at 160. I've been blessed with assets so I don't look as much as I weigh. I'm down 7lbs (about 2 of those are from fat, the rest water) which doesn't sound like much compared to other people. My body looks completely different though from before photos, my clothes fit better, and I've been measuring myself. I've lost TWELVE inches off my entire body so far. My mood is 10x better (after the most intense shark week I've ever experienced lol) and I wake up feeling energized. Do not give up. Do not make it all about the scale. It will come with time, but before you really consider giving up I beg you to take a look at all of the NSV's you're having. I would also recommend a larger feed day. I didn't move after my first week on the scale until today. I generally consume about 1450 calories (I lift weight too and this is the lowest I can go without being uber bitchy or feeling weak with my current activity levels), but on Saturday I did about 1700 calories and dropped back down to 1450 the rest of the week. Yesterday I did my first OMAD and today had a nice little 1.8 drop on the scale AND - .6 inches off my abdomen. KCKO. You got this."
keto,I eat the salt requirements and have even been drinking Powerade zero as well.
keto,"I have maybe a dumb question:  Is that 250 grams of meat, chicken, or fish?  Or is that enough meat, chicken or fish to have 250 grams of protein?  Because the latter seems difficult considering a can of tuna has like 20 grams of protein."
keto,"I've had duck confit Guiness gravy.  I'd sell my soul for a quart jar of it (and a straw if I'm being honest).

Cook something tomorrow you can have gravy on, get out some Xanthan gum and use that liquid."
keto,I‚Äôm about 15 lbs heavier than you (I mention that because it‚Äôs stays in your fat cells)and I peed clean in 12 days. I use a weed pen in addition to flower most days so I think you‚Äôll be fine as long as you don‚Äôt partake between then and now. I did 16:8 IF most days (never less than 12:12) and keto religiously.
keto,"Absolutely! I use a food scale and track everything!!! Its in pain in the butt at first, but you get used to it."
keto,"The best advice I can give is to read through the FAQ. All of the most common pitfalls and advice really are contained there.

The symptoms you are describing make it sound like you need electrolytes, most probably salt."
keto,Thank you for the breakout!  I‚Äôll brobably just up by one or two grams and call it a day.
keto,"I agree!  I‚Äôm back on the bandwagon after a tough Covid year, so I‚Äôm being a little too anal about tracking right now.  I‚Äôll settle back in, but it‚Äôs only day 3."
keto,"Testing ketones is useless for 99% of people here

Calendar day might be best for you even if you‚Äôre up for 36 hours at a time."
keto,"I have not once spent a dime on a keto meal plan and have been eating this way for years.

Eat a moderate-to-large amount of unbreaded meat and small-to-moderate amounts of non-starchy vegetables for 24 hours. Then... congrats! You've entered ketosis.

If you actually want more detail than that including a free starter meal plan, browse the links in the sidebar/subreddit info. Especially the FAQ, Macro Calculator, and (perhaps obviously) the 1-week meal plan."
keto,I‚Äôm thinking that actually sounds like an awesome idea.  I‚Äôll have to control myself on that one. Think of the electrolytes!!!  Lol!

keto,"My goal for protein was 94 g, but I've already eaten 200 g and going strong. Am I still ok if I stop with the protein for today?"
keto,Good job dude! Amazing!!
keto,Wow amazing! Good for you. Are you also counting your calories?
keto,"I would completely unscientifically add about 20% of the Guiness macros to the entire recipe assuming you aren't ladling the leftover liquid into a bowl and drinking it.  In the end, it's probably going to be pretty minimal once you divide it out into portions."
keto,"Fair enough, so thanks for that, and I hear that, and that could totally be happening here; but it's something that might not be overthinking as much for those of us who aren't naturally diurnal, you know what I mean? For folks like myself, this is kind of one of those things that matters a bit. Especially when you're strictly tracking macros for weight loss. You wouldn't want to overload on calories because you were awake longer, right?

But sure, this kind of thing could definitely be taken to overthought places; no doubt. But in a world where we're pretty strictly following macros and testing ketones, it could definitely matter to some folks. You know what I mean? And staying consistent doesn't work when you're consistently overeating (and not realizing it).

If I'm awake for 48 hours, should I still only be eating 2056 calories and sticking to that (waking day's) macros? Or should my intake be double because my caloric expenditure is technically double? Or is there something unique about sleep and caloric expenditure, or the lack of it, that would change things?

I guess I'm looking for more of a scientific insight that could help me make decisions with balancing macros when I'm awake for *longer than 24 to 36 hours*, not necessarily for those who don't sleep at night and wake up in the mornings. I figured that someone here has to have some experience with sleep science and nutrition; you know what I'm saying? Consider it theoretical, if anything. I'm not particularly obsessing over it, over here. Personally, I'm only a few pounds from my goal weight on this end, here.  


But it's more of a question about \*extended\* waking time that goes on into the long term, and how to handle that for macro tracking."
keto,"Yeah I'm 6 lbs away from being a ""normal"" weight according to the BMI, but definitely feel my best at 150. I find when you are close to a normal weight, an extra 30 lbs on your body sticks like glue. It can be really stubborn hence why I want to try keto. Slow and steady does win the race, good reminder."
keto,"It can be a long road and 30 pounds so far is a lot.  Keep going and remember it's not all about the number of the scale, your body is probably changing in other ways.  Your body does adapt to a calorie reduction so maybe try a day or two of normal calories or even some more, just to tell your body that there is food around.   Also having the occasional break from your calorie reduction helps your own mental outlook on food, knowing that not everyday will be a calorie restriction."
keto,Read the keto FAQ for this thread.
keto,"Wow that's an incredible amount, good for you."
keto,"Eat 14,392 Kcals/week, however that divides up.

Edit: it‚Äôs not overthinking. Anyone who‚Äôs ever worked night shift has struggled with this. It‚Äôs a crappy type of schedule."
keto,"Same, and it's actually the most surprising thing after trying it for a week. Whereas I'd get painfully hungry every two or three hours before this diet, for the past week I can barely meet 1000 calories. Just not that hungry.

Kind of hoping it evens out?"
keto,"I live in EST and work in MST so I tend to be up until 1-2am my time.  I use waking day even though my app tries to put anything I eat after midnight on the next day.  It just makes sense to me since sleeping is by default a fast, so I bracket me ""day"" with that."
keto,Doesn‚Äôt  matter as long as you are mostly consistent.
keto,"I'm 5'2 f. Sw 194, I'm currently at 167 very close to a 30lb lost. Its taken me a little over 4 months. I average about 1.8lbs a week! Doesn't take long!!"
keto,"Eat enough protein, fill in the rest with fat until you‚Äôre full. Keep carbs below 20 g. Eat real food and not keto bars or shakes. Get enough sleep, keep stress levels low. 

Chronically keeping calories low will train your body to lower its metabolic rate. 

Don‚Äôt count calories. It‚Äôs a fools game. Bad sleep has no calories. Stress has no calories. Both will prevent weight loss. It‚Äôs about hormones, not calories. Sure, someone is going to say: there‚Äôs no weight loss without a calorie deficit! I say: you‚Äôre not helping in any measurable way. Chasing calorie counts is why people turn to keto because chasing calories counts almost always fails. 

Look: read Gary Taubes, or Dr Ken Berry, or Dr Perlmutter. They‚Äôve spent decades researching keto. They recommend keto, not calorie reduction. Fix hunger, weight loss will follow. Limiting calories will only make you cold, hungry, irritable, and fat."
keto,"Jesus. You look like a reckon model dude. Great job, inspirational."
keto,"This is kinda overthinking. Whatever you do, do it consistently. For most people calendar day is easier. For people who work overnight, going by ‚Äúreset after a normal sleep cycle‚Äù might be the easier way"
keto,Good luck! All those changes will be extremely beneficial.
keto,"This is just a personal opinion.  If I was preparing a once a year meal, and I thought most would be left behind in the pot, I'd probably just ignore.

If you consume an extra gram of carbs that you don't count once a year, who cares?"
keto,"""Diet Doctor"" has simple weekly plans, recipes,  and shopping suggestions."
keto,I would use the sidebar calculator with a 0% deficit to determine how much you need to eat.
keto,I'm trying to quit while starting keto too. Not helping me yet lol
keto,"There are 9.6 carbs in 12 ounces of Guinness. Most recipes only call for 6 ounces and that will distributed throughout the entire meal and then divided out in each portion. Even if you used a full bottle it would still be 0.8 carbs a serving if you have 12 servings

That‚Äôs also assuming all of the carbs are still preset after cooking which I‚Äôm pretty sure wouldn‚Äôt be entirely accurate"
keto,"This can help make it simple for you :)

They freeze great and reheat in toaster or air fryer in just a few minutes, easy go to options:


1. Avacado ""toast"" just mash up Avacado, spread and salt to taste 

2. Grilled cheese - after the waffle is hot in the air fryer, top with a little cheese and put back in to melt. Good open face or as a sandwich 

3. Top with cream cheese and pretend it's a bagel (great with everything but the bagel seasoning)

4. Top with fried egg or egg salad 

5. Use as bread for any sandwich or burger"
keto,"As you are male and started quite a bit heavier, your experience is honestly irrelevant here.  OP is a whole lot closer to a reasonable weight, and if I'm guessing correctly is probably only classified as ""overweight"" and not ""obese"".  As such, the loss will not be dramatic, but will be a slow process.

OP - The loss of hunger makes a huge difference in being able to stick to the caloric deficit.  Slow and steady wins the race."
keto,"That sounds delicious! Can‚Äôt go wrong with that trifecta. ü§©

keto,"Congrats! I was a light smoker myself before keto. After about the first month I couldn't  finish a cig  either and  the urge just went away and eventually it was an out of sight outta mind thing.  Never found out why this happens under keto, or it's been so long that I've forgotten, I've read similar experiences as yours on this sub. I'm personally okay with it and probably much better off, too."
keto,"That's good to know. I've been religious about not eating fast food since I started Keto Life, but sometimes you just don't want to cook."
keto,"I've noticed this reduced craving too (I smoke marijuana, though). I always assumed it had to do with keto stablizing your blood sugar. Because nicotine and THC can both have an impact on blood sugar, it makes sense that your body would crave them as a remedy if your levels were up and down."
keto,As long as you are adding sufficient amounts of electrolytes to your lemon water and tea you can use them as the base for an electrolyte drink.

keto,"Omg your journey sounds exactly like mines. I‚Äôve been trying to lose for a few years, I went full plant based AND added exercise and only lost like 6 pounds in 2 months. It‚Äôs nuts how sugar and grains affects us. What‚Äôs also weird is I was diagnosed with having so many food allergies, almonds, shrimp, cheese, and eggs.

I hoping that after I reach goal I can keep the momentum going and stay clear of sugar and processed carbs and wheat. I really believe I had a gluten sensitivity. Congratulations!!! Take lots of pictures folks!!"
keto,Why do you think you need more fat?  If you're lethargic it may be electrolytes you're missing.    The consumption of fat is not what causes and maintains ketosis.  If you are not in ketosis it may be that your carbs are too high.  40 is double the suggested amount.

keto,Omg yes. I did the same thing and tracked calories on a 'regular' diet. Never got over 1800 cal. In a month I put on weight. I couldn't believe it. Everywhere says cal in cal out. Well for me that's bullshit. At least when it comes to carbs. I learnt a valuable lesson about my body that day. Everyone is different and do what works for you.
keto,Nope. Read the Automod post.
keto,"Congratulations!

Hope it is even easier to reach your goal.

Did you exercise as well as sticking to keto?"
keto,"savory breakfast bowl. 2 Whole boiled eggs sliced in half, 1/4 cup almond, 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese, half avocado, 5 cherry tomatoes."
keto,"That's for the epileptic protocol of Keto. We're focusing on fat loss. 

Protein is easy to hit. You just need to eat leaner meats. Chicken breast is your best friend. Very high in protein. 1 pound of chicken breast is 440 calories and 104g of protein and 4g of fat."
keto,"how many mg of sodium, potassium, and magnesium does this have, and how does that compare against the guidelines listed in the faq?"
keto,"Got it, I thought I read that protein should be less than the fats. I will adjust accordingly. It seems hard for me to hit the protein goal daily whereas it‚Äôs easier to hit the fat goal per day."
keto,"TIL confidence is measured in pounds. 

Stick to it and don't live and die by the scale. I've switched to only checking weight twice a week as it's almost always a confidence booster."
keto,"I don't have a favourite perse, most of the stuff I have on keto isn't exactly 'Indian', like pork, chicken, ham, fish etc. I make most of the stuff in coconut oil and sometimes add cheese. From time to time, I'll have an almond milkshake in the evening if I feel like it."
keto,"I literally don‚Äôt see how it could be construed as that. All apps give you percent of macros when setting up. 

And as you said, it doesn‚Äôt make sense. I gave macros to highlight what I was eating. I don‚Äôt assume everyone is an idiot without the ability to critically think."
keto,Lots of people do carnivore.  If veggies made me gag I would be a full time carnivore.  I wouldn't worry about it especially if you hate them so much.  You could switch over to carnivore which IMHO is the easiest way to do keto.  If you want to you could download and print a list of low carb veggies but mostly they are the green ones that grow above ground.  Maybe try just a few bites here and there.  It's not necessary though.  There is nothing to fix and it's not really an issue to waste any effort on.
keto,"A plateau is technically 5-6+ weeks with no weight loss, so congratulations...this isn't a plateau! It is the normal nonlinear weight loss process and is covered in the FAQ under the section titled ""what will my weight loss look like?""

https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq

https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/keto_in_a_nutshell

That being said, you didn't say anything about macros/calories. Do you use a food scale to weigh your portions? Are you tracking what you eat to ensure you're eating at a caloric deficit? Ketosis does not equal weight loss, calories still matter."
keto,"You're still in transition.  You will start to burn fat when you are fat adapted.  Just stick to plan, you're almost there.  You need to stay off the scale for now."
keto,Not much to be honest. Sometimes it would would make throw me off in the bathroom but for the most part I would digest properly.
keto,You get to decide what is terrible for you and what isn‚Äôt.
keto,"Wow! Beautiful in both photos, but you look so different now. I have also tried WW, last time I lost 4 pounds the first month, then 2 pounds Over the next 6 months before I gave up. I have tried every diet plan and psychological approach to lose weight. Nothing worked! Keto was the only thing that has ever worked, long-term. (2018 SW: 235, CW: 165, GW:135) 
I also am now getting more losses using Fasting too. Keep up the good work. You look so wonderful!üå∏üíïüéàmany blessings to you. Good luck as you continue your journey."
keto,"Accidentally broke my keto routine with a cauliflower crust pizza from MOD Pizza (pizza bowls do absolutely nothing for me), I knew it was too good to be true. I thought it'd be safe because of the cauliflower, I know it's not the end of the world or anything but I did feel bad. I guess I'll just write it off as a cheat day. ü§∑üèø"
keto,"When you say 'just water weight' I hope you aren't implying that it's not significant.  This is the first step in the keto process and is significant.  Once you deliver the message to your body that you no longer will be supplying it with enough carbs to fuel itself, changes start.  Carbs hold onto water and once you eliminate them,the water releases.  Step one accomplished!  Your body will continue to make adjustments and eventually stabilize.  A lot of people quit during this adjustment phase because although you may lose some water weight, you can also gain.  It's just part of the process but many read it as a fail.  Not so.  This is why the scale is not the best tool for keto beginners.  Witnessing these sometimes wild adjustments can be discouraging for some.  I never had a scale until I was 2 years keto and weighed in at my doctors request at my every 3rd month visit.  This was very freeing and helped me get over an unhealthy attachment to the scale.  It helped me realize I had to commit to the plan on a daily basis and not some number on a scale or a chart.  It took 3-4 weeks for me to become fat adapted and I started losing 12-15 pounds monthly.  I'm now at 130+ pounds lost, 10 sizes down and off of 11 of 12 prescriptions.  I started when I was 63 and Now I'm almost 66.  This is the best thing I've ever done for myself.  I feel great and more like 30.  I can hardly believe that after years of failed weight loss attempts, I finally got to the point where I'm just a normal sized person instead of the depressed fat lady hiding behind her baggy clothes in the corner.  Just promise yourself every morning that 'today I will stick to plan'.  Don't think about that number on the scale, the wedding you have to go to next Saturday or your next doctors appointment.  Just commit to today and following your eating plan that helps you stay in ketosis.  Try and take the focus off food by filling your life with non food related activity.  You can retrain yourself in a very short time and you will be amazed.  KCKO"
keto,Love them! Cup and char are the norm here in western ny. My daughters at the cheese only pizza stage but I get the peps so I can eat them off

keto,"oh wow, I merged the names of the 2 apps I've used! The one I'm currently using is Carb Manager (recommend, it's good). I've also used Cronometer (also good).  Sorry about that!"
keto,Cool! Thanks for posting. I just bought a box of Carbquik but haven‚Äôt tried it yet. I do get tired of the super cheese-heavy chaffles.
keto,Can't stress this enough. Gonna pin this in my clipboard so I have quick and easy access to reply to a lot of people on here who haven't read these.
keto,"You are aware of the adjustment you've made compared to what we usually stick to in this diet. If you begin to notice things are off, your mood is getting sour, feeling fatigued often, lethargy, or even if your weight loss still comes to a halt because your body headed into some sort of starvation mode (not as cut &amp; dry as we think), etc, then you know exactly what you need to fix. But if it's working for you and you're seeing results, stick to it. But like you implied; doing this doesn't really instill the best of habits, however, that 1400 calorie goal is sufficient enought for someone that's at your stats but normal weight; if I'm guessing correctly. 

Invest in some good multivitamins and hydrolyzed collagen. Take them both religiously."
keto,"You can eat low-carb veggies on Keto, but **you don't have to**. 

In fact, there is a subreddit at r/carnivorediet where Keto dieters only eat meat."
keto,"&gt; Unfortunately exercise tracker overestimate the number of calories exercise burns, especially at when we‚Äôre at higher weights.

Just want to point out that if this is done on a good fitness bike with a well calibrated power meter (from what I've seen most of them have it nowadays) then the calories burned will be pretty damn accurate."
keto,"https://perfectketo.com/gluconeogenesis/

Read everything there because you're spreading misinformation. Here's an excerpt;

""#1: Gluconeogenesis Is Always Happening In Ketosis

To answer the first part of the question, protein can‚Äôt ‚Äúactivate‚Äù gluconeogenesis because GNG is¬†already¬†happening during ketosis, as you learned above.

The thing is, it‚Äôs happening at a low rate that keeps ketones as the primary fuel.

Bottomline:¬†Protein or no protein, gluconeogenesis is happening, it‚Äôs helpful, and it‚Äôs not high enough to put you in glucose-burning mode.

#2. Ketosis Suppresses Gluconeogenesis, Not The Other Way Around

To answer the second part of the question, gluconeogenesis can‚Äôt pull you out of ketosis so easily.

Your body doesn‚Äôt like imbalances, which is why it‚Äôs always seeking homeostasis ‚Äî a state of internal equilibrium.

Ketones are your body‚Äôs way of keeping gluconeogenesis under control and preserving homeostasis.

It knows that if GNG goes unchecked for too long, it will indeed start breaking down muscle and kill you, so it acts just in time to stop that from happening by releasing ketones.

In addition, the rate of gluconeogenesis tends to be stable and undisturbed regardless of how many resources are available, as you learned before.

It‚Äôs simply not that easy to amp up the GNG rate by eating more protein.

Bottomline:¬†Your body fights to keep ketones as the main fuel and prevent gluconeogenesis from taking over, and the GNG rate is hard to disturb.

#3: Your Body‚Äôs Favorite Gluconeogenic Source Is Lactate, Not Protein

To answer the final part of the question, protein isn‚Äôt even the first choice for gluconeogenesis, and GNG actually helps to¬†build up¬†muscle.

Remember, lactate is your liver‚Äôs favorite gluconeogenic substance, and it‚Äôs consumed 2-3 times more than amino acids.

Evidence shows that after a fast of 12, 20, and 40 hours, the contribution of lactate to GNG was 41%, 71%, and 92%, respectively.[*]

Additionally, gluconeogenesis during ketosis is helpful for building muscle glycogen, which protects and heals muscles after exercise.

Bottomline:¬†Don‚Äôt be afraid that eating too much protein on keto will put you in glucose-burning mode."""
keto,Look up a recipe on YouTube for golden milk.... Also try to Incorporate more cinnamon into your diet... Look up hidden carbs.... Add avocado to your diet.... Make sure to get plenty rest!
keto,"Hahaha. Don't worry. You can always get boiled eggs, milk and paneer. Don't forget the Indian favourite Ghee. Add it to the milk (if you can digest it LOL).

Also, keep almonds with you and eat 4-5 every day. Keep some greens such as lettuce and cucumber. Mix cucumber, lettuce and paneer and have it as a salad. That's a really innovative way to eat.

By the way, what's your favourite Indian keto food?"
keto,Beautiful!
keto,"&gt;It‚Äôs percentage of calories... not percentage of grams (which still doesn‚Äôt make sense). That wouldn‚Äôt make any sense. Which is why I gave a 1700 kcal total at the end.  
&gt;  
&gt;240g fat is more than 1700 kcal alone.  
&gt;  
&gt;You keep editing your post and doubling down on the misunderstanding.  
&gt;  
&gt;It‚Äôs percentage of overall calories. It‚Äôs not complicated. You made the mistake.

So make that clear in your original post. 

A newbie is going to see those percentages and they're just going to assume that they need to eat twice as much fat as protein. 

And please don't pretend that a newbie wouldn't see it that way. Deep down, you know perfectly well that's how a newbie would likely interpret the percentages you provided."
keto,"Yeah man, I wish we had bacon strips and pork rinds available in colleges in India lmao, I'll be happy if I get a good amount of chicken"
keto,"Definitely man, I always stick to a healthy lifestyle when it comes to food, it's just that I won't be able to do keto there, that's why I'm doing it again while I have the chance."
keto,"If you‚Äôre simply eating animal fat and protein, your body will sort it out through your hunger triggers. Eat when you‚Äôre hungry, period. You may gain weight in the beginning because your body is actually getting proper nutrition and not filling with empty hard to digest plant foods and quick carbs. Eventually your hunger dies down because you‚Äôre actually being fed properly and that when weight loss happens. So, eat as much as you like actually does work."
keto,"What they said and more water and more sleep.

KCKO"
keto,It‚Äôs percentage of calories... not percentage of grams. That wouldn‚Äôt make any sense.
keto,"&gt;That‚Äôs literally what I said re: protein min fat max.  
&gt;  
&gt;And fuck me I wish I didn‚Äôt say anything. My targets are 148 protein, 22 carbs, 113 fat. Why are you being so fucking stubborn. I gave clear wide windows and also the exact same advise you just did.

Again, do the math

According to the first fat percentage you posted, your fat is 240g, not 120g. Break out your calculator if you don't believe me. 

&gt;**60-65% fat**  
&gt;  
&gt;30-35% protein  
&gt;  
&gt;5% carbs  
&gt;  
&gt;That‚Äôs around 140g protein, 120g fat, and 20g carbs for me, at a daily 1700 kcal target."
keto,"I totally understand the problem bro. I also have stayed away from home for studies and the kind of food we get in hostels is of a totally different level. ROFL..

But even in the hostel, try to keep some good nutritious food which will prevent you from becoming nutrition deficient. Eggs are easily available, try to keep a bag of bacon strips, pork rinds.

**Be it any diet, not necessarily keto, always try to keep the nutrition level as high as possible.**

All the best! :)"
keto,"SOYA!

Spell
Out
Your
Acronyms"
keto,"I totally agree with you that gluconeogenesis is demand-driven and not supply-driven. **But please also note that if our body has excess carbs or proteins, then our body prefers that fuel over ketones.** 

**Even when we enter ketosis, our body first uses the excess proteins in the liver and the muscles and converts them to carbohydrates for energy** before it really starts producing ketones from fat.

**So any amount of excess protein has the potential to kick you out of ketosis.** Definitely, this varies from person to person and each individual has his own limit of protein consumption before getting out of ketosis."
keto,"You sound like you are looking for excuses to continue with the 'vicious cycle'.  Why?  You already know how that will turn out.  Put your big girl panties on and just do it.  If you don't, well you know the likely result."
keto,"&gt;but I wasn't losing weight (probably improper tracking of food intake),

Maybe there's your long term solution. If you do keto until you go to college you should be focusing on the nutritional aspects that you can carry forward and are sustainable. If we can't do keto for whatever reason that doesn't mean we should throw all those other principles of the door, like calorie control."
keto,Lol I know but it means exactly two weeks since I last changed something and I find it easier changing one thing at a time. I actually ended up starting yesterday as it happens. Thanks people
keto,"&gt; The simple answer is that athletes who burn glucose during exercise can eat more than the keto carb limit and stay in ketosis.

Can confirm, back when I was still doing keto I would meticulously track the calories burned during exercise and eat those back as carbs - got myself tested a couple of times just to see what happens and I still had high levels of ketones."
keto,I gave Windows. Try again
keto,"Hey man, thanks for the reply. I totally get you, but the problem is I can only get food for keto when I'm home. The colleges I have applied to are far from my home, and I have gone through the food selection at the colleges as well, and it doesn't look good in terms of keto. At home, I can get/make whatever I want, but in college. it won't be easy at all. That's why I want to stick to keto right until I go to college, after which I'll focus on muscle gaining in college. About the cycling part, I understand that but I need to work with what I get, so yeah. All I want it to maximise my results and get leaner. I think my body fat is around 15%, though I'm not too sure."
keto,"You are giving misinformation to OP.  Please STOP.

Gluconeogenesis is demand driven, not supply driven.  ""Excess"" protein is not a thing, for most of us.  Gluconeogenesis occurs only in response to an immediate need for glucose, not because our bodies have an arbitrary cutoff point for protein and start turning it into candy corn.

""Excess"" protein cannot ""kick you out of ketosis."""
keto,Day 1 and I‚Äôm excitedü§©! I did keto a year ago and lost a lot of weight. Unfortunately my partner and I have a terrible relationship with food and I put most of it back on. But we‚Äôre BOTH doing it this time around üòÑ
keto,"The best keto snack is a boiled egg yolk. It's healthy, tasty and has many essential nutrients. Else in meat-based options, you can consider sausage balls, beef jerky, bacon strips etc. 

I personally feel keto is a heaven for meat lovers. There are so many options we have got.. Hahaha. :) :)"
keto,"‚ÄúWelcome to r/keto! It sounds like you‚Äôre a little confused about how to measure your macros.

keto,"That's awesome. The walk is an amazing aerobic exercise. I myself go cycling for 45 minutes every day. I know the positive effect it has on me. It's amazing.

For weightlifting, it depends on how vigorous a lift you are doing. If you seriously are lifting heavy and want to get muscle mass, then go for a TKD and increase protein consumptions in steps, for example, increase 10 grams every alternate day till a limit.

If you doing routine weights to tone yourself, then there is enough protein in a regular ketogenic diet from eggs, bacon etc which should help you. 

See it all depends on whether you are looking at a target of gaining muscle mass while losing fat or just want to get in shape first and then gain muscle. If it is the latter case, then you should continue focussing on aerobics (walk), and lift moderate weight to help you get in shape. 

All the best! Let's stay in touch and do keep me informed on your progress. :) :)"
keto,"Thanks so much! Another poster mentioned that these are actually terrible for you, so after I finish off this pack I‚Äôll try getting it from the deli instead. I‚Äôve never even heard of boursin cheese before, so I‚Äôll have to look into it. Meat snacks are truly the best way to go. Thanks for sharing your suggestions. :)"
keto,"Your math doesn't add up.

60% does not correspond to 120g if 30% corresponds to 140g.

You mixed up the figures!"
keto,"Oh wow, thanks. I didn‚Äôt realize it was so problematic. I‚Äôll finish this pack and then maybe do what the other poster mentioned and get deli meats instead. 


&gt;**If you want to snack on keto, there are multiple options available.** Coconut chips, kale chips, hard-boiled eggs with the yolk, almonds and cheddar cheese... the list goes on.

Hey, from my post I‚Äôm looking for things that don‚Äôt involve nuts, coconut, or chocolate. I‚Äôve found that it‚Äôs hard to find options that don‚Äôt involve any of those, and half of your examples even have them. Do you have more snack examples that don‚Äôt have those things? I feel like most of my options are going to be meat-based, which is great, but also that‚Äôs why I went towards the pepperoni."
keto,Congratulations!!!! I started the same day and I‚Äôve been carnivore the last two weeks and I‚Äôm down the same amount as you. I have about 80 to loose and I know we‚Äôll hit our goals with hard work and focus ‚ù§Ô∏è. Good Luck!!!!
keto,"Thanks for the feedback!

I take 3-5 mile walks 3-4 days and week, but I‚Äôve also just began lifting weights again, so I was worried about not getting enough protein to support muscle gain, especially at such a large calorie deficit."
keto,"Hey. You have got a pretty inspiring story there. That's awesome man.

**One basic rule I would like to mention here is that** ***""don't lose weight to get healthy. Rather get healthy to lose weight.""***

As you have written in your post, you have been frequently in and out of ketosis alternating between the high carb and low carb diets. This is something that could harm your body.

**I would generally prefer being on a long term diet**/ketosis around 6 months minimum as it will help the body make the most of the diet.

**It will also help improve your long term health.** See you are very young and there is a long life ahead of you. Maintaining a consistent diet with everyday exercise has some benefits which will last you the whole life.

**So many decades down the line when you look back at what good you did to your body at a young age, you would thank yourself. :)**"
keto,"Never too late, OP!"
keto,"Firstly, it's a good thing if you are not hungry after eating 900-1400 calories. NEVER EAT WHEN YOU ARE NOT HUNGRY! That's a basic rule.

Secondly don't overdo protein. See our body has a mechanism called gluconeogenesis by which it converts the extra protein to carbohydrates for instant use. Excess protein has the potential to kick you out of ketosis. 

Try to add some light exercise to your routine. Go for a walk, light yoga, cycling, whatever suits you. That would further trigger fat burning if you are in ketosis.

And the basic rule is never to eat when you are not hungry. I hope this helps and you can easily reach your weight loss goals on keto. :)"
keto,Awesome!
keto,"**WARNING!!!**

**Please don't overdo this snack.** *The following are the list of ingredients used in making the cup and crisp pepperoni as mentioned on its label.*

**Ingredients:** Pork, Beef, Salt, Contains 2% or less of Water, Dextrose, Spices, Lactic Acid Starter Culture, Sodium Ascorbate, Oleoresin of Paprika, Flavoring, Sodium Nitrite, Citric Acid, BHA, BHT, Beef Collagen Casing. No Big 8 Allergens Present

Please note here that it may have 0 grams of carbs and 14 grams of fats, but **it also has dextrose which is a sugar substitute. They may be hiding something which they don't want you to know.**

**It also has sodium nitrite which has been proven to damage blood vessels, making your arteries more likely to harden and narrow, leading to heart disease.** It also increases your chances of cancer.

**It also has sodium ascorbate which could increase your sodium levels leading to hypertension, diabetes, and kidney disease** that can cause more harm than good.

**Overall, the label contains too many additives/ preservatives.** *It's something I would definitely avoid and would not recommend to you too.*

**Try to go for something natural and organic. It always helps! :) :)**"
keto,"&gt;Most veggies and fruits still have more carbs than my allowance. Is this normal? 

Yes, you're **not** supposed to eat those.

keto,"You can buy deli counter pepperoni that's wider slices (think like a slice of bologna) and put them in muffin tins to crisp up into cups in the oven. Then top with whatever you want.

I like taking normal pepperoni slices, microwaving for a minute or two until crisp, and then dipping in boursin cheese. Pepperoni chips also make a good snack for hiking, picnics, camping, or the movie theatre."

keto,"You're so right. It always frustrates me how everything revolves around food. That's a big part of why I am trying this, try to get rid of the glutinous tendancies. Then I can use food as you say, as fuel, rather than because I fancy a treat."
keto,This is only true in the USA. If you are from the EU or England fiber is already substracted from the total carbs.
keto,"Thanks for the input, and congrats on your current and future weight loss!"
keto,"WOW, quite a difference.  Applause for sticking with the Keto diet."
keto,"First, congratulations! Well done.

I‚Äôm on a modified keto plan and just finished my first month down 23 pounds. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô7‚Äù and (now) 390lbs. The difference for me (the ‚Äúmodified‚Äù part) is that I chose to do formulated nutrition using Medifast/Optavia instead of groceries.

But it‚Äôs the same basic idea, ultra low carb and calories to trigger ketosis and let your liver metabolize fat into ketones and acetone to cover the balance. But instead of a mountain of chicken I‚Äôm eating five 110 calorie ‚Äúfuelings‚Äù that are little snack bar things, and one small cooked meal with lean protein and veggies. 

I think the idea is that the formulated nutrition will maintain a healthier balance that‚Äôll let me go longer on program with no ill effects than a straight keto plan. It‚Äôs less effort to snarf down a fuel bar every 3 hours and the ingredients are a science fair of vitamins and essentials that might be harder to keep straight just cooking. 

I plan to stick with this for at least 100 days before a break, and while I‚Äôm hungry a lot and I miss sandwiches, I‚Äôm not stupid and tired and don‚Äôt feel a decline in vitality over weeks. The energy is coming from somewhere. 

So I‚Äôd say if you‚Äôre worried about health effects, diversify your inputs without increasing calories or carbs. As long as you don‚Äôt break keto, you should be free to experiment."

keto,"Yeah you really have to look at the nutritional info, most restaurants that do some sort of cauliflower crust are loaded with carbs from the fillers. They're made for the gluten free folks, but in doing so it's high carb from rice or potato flour.

I eat 2lbs of it often in a meal after the gym and feel like crawling into a ball of sleep afterwards. Supreme satisfaction.

The other, more important tip is to stuff yourself with low-calorie, dense foods. Like salad greens. Limit kale (high calorie in comparison), but just about every other green is on the menu. Stuff yourself every meal with that. Be very careful with salad dressings lol. This is a very filling way to stuff yourself without much of the calories.

Notice how much calories and room for fat you have (should be soft-limited to about 80-100g; let your body supply most of the fat for energy) and possibly start to dread that next meal because it feels like there's no room. 

Enjoy the micronutrients of consuming more greens."
keto,You could eat my dick
keto,thanks for the tip!
keto,$6+ each crust. Ouch.
keto,Thx!!
keto,So being non active and eating 3500 calories a day with actually losing weight has nothing to do with metabolism?  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
keto,"Better option:

Buy low carb tortilla soft shells I think 6 carbs. Load them carefully with what you want and cook them in the oven. 

Works great every time. The crust is a bit thin but it‚Äôs low carb!!"
keto,There's a plain sans-seeds version of it that my local grocery stocks.
keto,"I'm going to roast some radishes to bring to my parent's house for our boiled dinner.  Even though they're roasted, they remind me of little boiled red potatoes."
keto,"Potassium is more important than sodium, I bet you have it there, it's a salt replacement also sometimes called no salt. If you look up potassium salt replacement UK or they do sell it on amazon! There are a few studies that say potassium:sodium ratio makes a big difference in blood pressure and potassium is important in general. 

Personally I don't always supplement because I'm lazy and I don't generally need it but if I start feeling off at all I down some and feel better in 5 minutes. Maybe always supplement would help though üòÇ"
keto,"You can get Carbonaut bread from Natura Market! I personally really enjoyed it, but haven‚Äôt had it too often."
keto,It doesn‚Äôt change your metabolic rate but ok
keto,Wow that stuff is expensive
keto,Hey! Yeah I‚Äôve been trying to read up and understand the whole electrolytes thing. I‚Äôm from the U.K. so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just ignorant or whether we sell half salt here. I‚Äôve been having a chicken stock cube and hot water as a sort of cup a soup to increase my sodium intake?
keto,"For the most part I‚Äôm eating the protein. Typically eggs, beef, sardines, avocados, broccoli, and cauliflower. When I cook my eggs I mix in some cheese. Sometimes I snack on Brazil nuts and macadamia nuts. I have buttered coffee with MCT oil and protein powder with cacao powder as my preworkout drink. Also I drink some water with Himalayan salt to give me some electrolytes. 

As for my macros I need 124g of protein, 20g of carbs, and 126g of fat to lose body fat. Calorie-wise I need about 1900 with the goal of losing body fat."
keto,"Yup I used to get them a lot when transitioning into ketosis. Now I rarely do. I found them comical after the fact, but in the moment they are stressful."
keto,"The Carbonaut bread from Costco tastes great but the seeds on top are a problem for me, they get stuck in my gums."
keto,"It's completely normal. In most cases, you don't really have to workout on keto if you're already in a calorie deficit and the goal is to lose weight."
keto,Documentaries are all bullshit and also welcome to capitalism
keto,Mostly people who don‚Äôt read the box
keto,"Make sure to get your electrolytes in, half salt from the grocery store will save you. It really helps with the fatigue. Good luck!"

keto,"Ketosis does not equal weight loss. 

Calories still matter, you‚Äôre eating too many of you aren‚Äôt losing weight. 

If you think you are ‚Äúyet to enter ketosis‚Äù because you‚Äôre peeing on sticks, don‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôs pointless. 

The keto flu is nothing more than a lack of proper electrolyte supplementation and is 100% optional.

keto,"This is like saying 'cauliflower mac and cheese' where it's still pasta and whatever cheese sauce, you just put cauliflower pieces in with it. Vs using cauliflower as the pasta, which I guess you just call cauliflower cheese casserole? Idk"
keto,"Well, I'm comparing it to last time I was on keto, and I also used test strips."
keto,Net carbs.
keto,"Yoooo thanks for this! I am trying to get a better look at my macros. Based on the calculator I need about 124g of protein, 20g of carbs, and 126g of fat to lose body fat. And a total of 1900 calories."
keto,Are you counting net carbs or total carbs?
keto,"How do you know you aren‚Äôt in ketosis?

How many mg of sodium, potassium, and magnesium are you getting per day, and how does that compare against the electrolyte guidelines listed in the FAQ?"
keto,Thankyou so much!!! Sometimes it takes you to have a rough time to realise it‚Äôs time to make changes. Hopefully keto will be a big one for me.
keto,If you‚Äôre not losing weight you‚Äôre consuming too many calories
keto,Sounds similar to intuitive eating.
keto,"0hGeeze Keto Pizza Recipe

keto,Not sure if that's the one they mean but I found Carb0naut at Canadian Costco and I love it. Grilled cheese sandwiches are back on the menu.
keto,A local cafe makes a keto dessert that is sort of like sex in a pan.  Base of but brownie mix with layers of cream cheese and chocolate pudding all topped with whipped cream.  I'm lucky they charge 15$ for a parfait cup or I would eat it all the time.
keto,Very common... and bizarre! I find a good outlet for my decaying carb addiction. Just roll with it üòÅ
keto,"I don‚Äôt know who came up with the myth that cauliflower is low carb, but bravo"
keto,When my family eats pizza... I use the low carb tortillas and make my own thin crust pizzas and it's so good !!!! It totally doesn't feel like I'm missing out and we all get to enjoy pizza night!!
keto,"Don't beat yourself up. I am sure others will say the, it is a process.  Keep at it.  You will begin to lift, pull, push more every week into the gym, it becomes addicting, in a good way.  Soon you will say to yourself how easy that 20 minutes of cardio was.  One day you will pick something up and say to yourself, WOW that felt really light and easy.  One day you will walk up a flight of stairs and say to yourself, WOW I am not winded. Give it time.  Come back in six weeks and tell us how much you have improved and how much better you feel."
keto,"Marco‚Äôs Pizza has their pizza bowls now and they are delicious. I just add it to a low carb tortilla, bake, and I have a yummy crispy super thin crust pizza!"
keto,"I found a chocolate pudding that‚Äôs kinda somewhere between a mousse and a pudding, a super simple steamed custard that can be vanilla or chocolate, a lemon curd, using half and half in jello to make gummis (thats more a snack than a dessert), and cranberries in either sf orange jello or sf black cherry jello."
keto,Don‚Äôt use a pan? I put mine directly on the rack.
keto,"Definitely better than pizza.  Even if you can't peel off the batter, it would likely be a small amount of carbs compared to a pizza, even a cauli crust one that's got regular flour."
keto,"&gt;I think the main market for those crusts is the gluten-free community, not low carb/keto.

Seconded.  We're looking at the world through our rose-colored glasses.  We see ""cauliflower"" and think low-carb...because in our world thats what it means.  The rest of the world is more worried about something being plant-based and gluten-free, regardless of carbs.  A good reminder to always check the nutrition facts."
keto,"Best keto mug cake: google search keto mug cake and use the recipe by lowcarbmaven, it uses mayo and an egg yolk. It's the BEST mug cake recipe out there, I've just about tried them all lol. I also add a splash of heavy whipping cream on top after it's done.

Also it's not a recipe but I love Rebel ice cream. The best flavor is cherry chip! But they are all so good."
keto,Enlightened caramel chocolate double dough keto ice cream. It‚Äôs like I died and went to heaven
keto,"My favorite is a sugar-free cheesecake. Those taste closest to the standard.  However, I recently made a two-ingredient chocolate mousse that was delightful and very much hit the spot after a long day.  (whip some cream, stir in melted chocolate of your choice.  boom. dessert. I don't have a recipe link because I just made it up as I went along.)"
keto,Ouch! Best of luck.
keto,"I just go with fathead pizza, but i've been ordering this [Joseph's Bakery Lavash Bread](https://www.lowcarbcanada.ca/products/josephs-bakery-lavash-bread) and using that as a thin crust, or rolling it up and making pizza rolls. it's fucking amazing"
keto,Quest frozen pizza hits the spot . 6 net carbs only and taste like real ( frozen ) pizza
keto,"Unless you end up somewhere that batter fries their wings. Ugh. 

Still might be better than the pizza though‚Ä¶"

keto,I am a professional bodyboarder. I was very active but not as much now. Had several injuries/ surgeries with in the past 4 years. Still in the ocean doing my normal routine just not daily.
keto,"Hey, not sure where in Canada you are, but I am in BC, and Save On has their own keto bread and it is fantastic."
keto,Do you have the recipe somewhere? Sounds good!
keto,Are you working out?
keto,My go-to dessert is plain Greek yogurt mixed with sugar free jam.  I stir in some Catalina Crunch keto cereal for texture.  I have 2-3 different jams and 2-3 different cereals so I can always change it up.
keto,"Hey fellow Canadian, Pizza Pizza has keto crust and it‚Äôs actually really good (despite their regular pizza being absolute trash lol). The crust is made by Unbun and the net carbs aren‚Äôt too bad. It‚Äôs pretty expensive but worth it once in a while."
keto,Quest pizzas are pretty reliable for me! Minus the 10 dollar price tag that is basically a damn Tostitos party pizza
keto,"What's the secret to cooking them? They either stick to the pan, burn at the bottom, or end up with a flimsy bottom. I cannot figure it out!"
keto,"For my birthday, my wife made me a keto cheesecake with almond flour crust. uses erythritol as a sweetener but it was amazing. Luckily the ingredients in cheesecake are all pretty keto friendly besides the sugar and the crust."
keto,Pumpkin cheesecake!
keto,"If you're in Canada, I think Pizza Pizza has [""keto pizza""](https://www.pizzapizza.ca/keto/) made with the unbun crust someone else mentioned. I believe it's around 2-3g net carbs per slice depending on which toppings you go with."
keto,"Pizza Pizza has keto crust now, supplied by Unbun. It‚Äôs actually really good. This is coming from someone who always trash talked Pizza Pizza for being cardboard."
keto,I had a similar experience. It was a big eye opener.
keto,"Most cauliflower substitutes i've seen aren't low carb in general.  They don't taste good either.  

I don't even need to see the nutritional information, I can feel my feet start to swell up / sweat when I eat them.. It's super weird but it's an immediate indicator I've gone over on carbs."
keto,Yeah I‚Äôve run into some subpar desserts as of late so I‚Äôm really excited what everyone has to offer.
keto,"I always have to use baking paper or grease proof paper to roll it out, I put a sheet under and one on top and then I bake the crust still on the paper. Otherwise it‚Äôs a pain and a mess!"
keto,It absolutely can. The effects on carnivore were insane.
keto,"Looking at your numbers, it appears that you are in a rush to lose body fat.  Starting keto, extreme low carb of 10 carbs/day, and cutting calories 25%.  You may be trying to do too much all at once.

Many sources recommend not cutting calories significantly until after you are fat adapted - your body has adjusted to burning fats/ketones instead of carbs/glucose.  25% calorie cut is fairly aggressive which might be ok if you have a very large amount of fat to lose and not active.  

Why did you chose 10 net carbs/day?  Cutting down to 20 g is hard for most people.  You must have a will of iron!  That would limit the amount of low carb vegetables you eat.  

You might want to look at r/ketogains for a keto approach to bodybuilding.  Their macro calculator allows more adjustments for athletes."
keto,"After trying several recipes that were not great, I‚Äôve sort of given up on desserts, but I‚Äôd love to see some here! My saving grace has been Lily‚Äôs Milk Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups. Or sometimes just a Diet Barq‚Äôs with a splash of half and half."
keto,"I love it too but it's kind of a pain to make and to work with, isn't it? Or have I been doing it wrong. To make it is easy enough, just messy. But I have a hard time rolling it out and shaping it."
keto,"If something sounds to good to be true, it usually is."
keto,Ding ding
keto,Fat head dough cinnamon rolls with powered swerve and cream cheese icing
keto,It‚Äôs frustrating for sure. I saw a cauliflower crust frozen pizza (like to have ‚Äòbreak in case of emergency‚Äô foods) advertised as ‚ÄúKeto!‚Äù but it was 24g of net carbs for 1/4 of the pizza.
keto,Boston pizza
keto,"I don't have dreams about carbs, but I definitely wake up remembering many more of my dreams than I ever used to before since starting keto.  And yes, they tend to be more vivid, and often a little disturbing in nature.

I don't mind it; it makes for interesting self-thoughts in the mornings."
keto,You don't need carbs.  I ride between 30-60 miles 3x a week FASTED w/ water only &amp; I've done over 100 miles in a day with minimal nutrition.  Get your cadence up to 90 and you'll be able to ride forever.
keto,"I take 14 chocolate chips, a full tablespoon of peanut butter, and some crushed pork rinds. Heat in microwave and stir for Peanut Butter Chocolate Crunch. Around 12-14g carbs but it's the quickest and dirtiest Keto dessert I know how to make. Low calorie as well."
keto,I had a dream the other night an ex girlfriend from college years ago was roasting cauliflower(it was like comically large though dreams are awesome) for me and her...something I probably would have scoffed at way back when. she‚Äôs a professional chef nowadays funnily enough. I never thought about what she was making in the dream and Keto could be related  until I read this post. Huh
keto,"Okay I‚Äôll give you a clue: ‚ÄúAn American city‚Äù Pizza. 

Second clue: it‚Äôs a city where car keys are pronounced as ‚Äúkhakis‚Äù"
keto,Same.  All the cheese and toppings please!
keto,"FNewk's took a while to come out with nutritional details for their cauliflower crusts. It ended up being a couple grams of carbs more than their normal pizza.

Another culprit is Noodles and Company which now has cauliflower gnocchi that are carby. Fortunately, these are easy to avoid because they aren't that good anyway."
keto,I‚Äôm 6ft 4 was 220 lbs strictly keto since 2016 so 5 years. My weight did get to low on strict keto went down to 173 and I was eating tons of meats and veggies morning would be 4 eggs with avocado every morning. Had to reintroduce carbs slowly back into my life. But my digestive system still doesn‚Äôt like carbs period. As of now the only carb I can handle is brown rice. So I did that my weight is little better up to 180 where I feel better.
keto,"I‚Äôm a week and a half into keto, I‚Äôve only lost about 1.2lbs and am not sure if I count calories or just focus on eating the fat i need to help my body transition to ketosis? I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11, 195lbs. I‚Äôve been eating 2100-2200 calories/day. For a 15% deficit I should be at 1862 calories. I need 126 protein, 142 fat and 26 carbs Abe I‚Äôve stuck pretty close to those, just am a couple few hundred calories off. I‚Äôm curious why I haven‚Äôt dropped more weight initially as well?"
keto,"I do alright mixing about three days worth of lite salt in a half liter of water and drinking it across 3 days. I like to add some mio energy shot to it.

It's pretty whack but 200ml is all I need for a day. Space out your magnesium supplements though"
keto,"Zero carb! Low carb high protein is much easier than low carb high fat, in my personal experience."
keto,Hanging in there.  I've lost 18 lbs. but gained 1 back.  Yesterday I was depressed and ate my way through it on no keto foods.  The consequence is that I feel like crap today and no long in ketosis.  Hopeful in the next day or two I'll have it back.  Gotta pee on the slick.
keto,In Canada? Do you happen to know which brand?
keto,"Even the ""low carb"" option sounds way too high to me, unless it's half fiber (or more"". The best keto crusts I've had usually are cheese mixed with almond flour, or similar. Pizza is very hard to make authentically keto, sadly, much like pasta."
keto,"I've always said that if a steak needs sauce, it isn't a good steak.  But that's just my opinion.

Have you tried crumbled bleu cheese on steak?  As long as you don't overdo it, it is pretty amazing!"
keto,Congrats! Keep it up
keto,Name and shame: it's Pizza Pizza isn't it :')
keto,I do 1 tsp salt 1 tsp magnesium cottage 1 tsp potassium citrate cause it tastes so nasty.  Then 1 tsp salt later in the day.  Not sure if its bad or not but definitely gives me some shits.
keto,"Yes,  all 3 of us have learned that lesson.  It seems many of the keto food tracking apps are too generous in allowed carbs and allowed callories per day.  It seems in all 3 of our experiences, it is better to have a simple, non-processed keto diet.  Eating fresh veggies, meats, cheeses (ok I know these are processed...), avocado, etc, without eating ""keto friendly"" store bought snacks seems to work best for all of us."
keto,Have you been recalculating your macros with every 10 pound loss?
keto,"Not to be overly blunt, but if a plateau lasts multiple months, you need to eat less. If you want to put in the effort to track calories, that is the most reliable way, or you could do IF and skip breakfast, or just lower portion sizes slightly. It‚Äôs up to you what you think you can best stick to, but if you can‚Äôt burn more calories exercising then you need to eat less."
keto,Does this mean you are post-pre-diabetes? :-)
keto,does your grill not have a diverter that keeps the drippings away from the flame?!
keto,You get a bright purple stick at first because your body is not using the ketones efficiently at first and the excess spills over into your pee.  After a few weeks you may not get a reading at all because your body has learned to use them efficiently.
keto,"I agree and I think the 10% of body weight loss is the trigger for many. So many positive health benefits happen at that point that I think it is kind of a gatekeeper for further loss. 

I also believe people do not count macros or log their caloric intake very well (or at all) when things are going well. I know when I started keto this time I only counted carbs...period. I was dropping lbs and feeling good so why bother with the math and writing things down? 

Well... amazingly I hit a plateau at about 10% body weight lost and started tracking more than carbs. What do you know... I was eating the amount of calories I needed to sustain my plateau weight. Made some changes and made sure I was in a deficit and the plateau went away. I still catch myself planning a meal like a fat guy... 3 tacos, a side or this, add this to the tacos. maybe a dessert... but writing it down and realizing where I am with regard to consumption for the day allows me to make changes to portions and meals and stay in line. 

I am always surprised that I am full after eating a lighter dinner. My brain is used to seeing so much more food on the plate. 

I like your theory, you are (I believe) right on the money with the human body and how adaptive it is."
keto,"Where have you heard that?  The general consensus is to stay below 20g net carbs, not between 20 and 50."
keto,This. Or cast iron.
keto,What you think is wrong. You can't eat extra or unlimited carbs just because they are from veggies.
keto,That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs marketed for(bulletproof coffee) but plenty of people jump to keto and need a sub so they resort to heavy cream when butter can do the trick too
keto,I actually only turn on just one side of the grill.  I put the burgers on the unlit side and close the lid which sort or roasts them.  I then open the lid and put them on the lit side for just a minute or so to brown them up a bit more.  I tried misting with a spray bottle of water which kept the flare ups down but my grill got rusty.  Can't win!
keto,Read Dr. Atkins book.  He explains the science behind it.

keto,Agreed. Great to hear.
keto,"I thought it was to fatten up, not a cream replacement (pause)"
keto,"I am so glad! Honestly now, a year into it and sticking with it this time, I prefer to eat this way. I cook almost all my meals, I use fresh whole foods, and I love everything in my arsenal. I use IF so I eat between 12pm and 6pm, and that works well for me. Just having so much energy and genuinely being a happier person!! Keep up the dedication. I know you can do this! Just think in a month where you'll be!"

keto,Enough to party
keto,"I don't know what Factor 75 is, but here is what I think about carbs on keto:  as long as I only eat green/salad veggies (cooked or raw) as carbohydrates, the number is irrelevant (and sometimes can go up to 30-40, though usually ends up around 20).  As soon as I start adding nuts, milk or fruit, I can't go over 20 or I don't lose."
keto,"Hi - of course I tried it üôÉ 
My experience was very dissatisfying. A scam... 
1)After starting the program, I realized that the recipes they are offering are quite limited in nutrient choice and very repetitive. 
When I tried to adjust the food preferences to increase diversification, the app did not react at all. Same food, same receipts.
2) I tried to add my own ingredients (simple food) and most the app does not even recognize. Instead it offers products from processed food companies. Gives very much the impression of advertisement...
3) After 3 weeks I started to contact them via the chat function. As long as you ask money unrelated question, the robot is answering. As soon as you ask a concrete question regarding the subscription or terms for cancellation, the answers stop and you are completely (!!) ignored. 
I then started calling the help desk number - nobody answering. I called 2 days in row until I decided to leave a message on the answering machine - it‚Äôs unfortunately for the bin... Nobody ever returned the call nor reacted in the chat.
Meanwhile they spam you with additional offering about extra services you could buy on top.

All together very disappointing. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

keto,"My back hurts all the time from trying to hold my frame upright. Has you felt less pain?

Also, when I wear pants, my gut protrudes over the top and it‚Äôs uncomfortable AF unless they‚Äôre sweatpants. Have you noticed any less discomfort?"
keto,"Almost three years in. If you eat more than your carb limit twice a month, you will not reap the benefits of keto in my experience.
After week three, keto balances out for me: less hunger and craving, more energy etc.

I don't 'cheat' and don't like the term. I'm not playing a game. I make choices, I'm responsible. There is no way out of that. 

However, we do have our moments, which are planned by purpose. We do ""carb fest"" twice a year: 
A week during summer vacation. One Christmas day and new years eve. On those days, we eat all the things we sometimes feel we miss. We eat like pigs. Next day, strict back: we throw away any left overs. 

The first year of keto, I made a wish list for it. Every time I craved something, I wrote it down and promised myself to eat it during that week in summer. It helps to don't feel deprived. So if there is chocolate at work, I wrote down the chocolate bar I would eat in summer. 

Notice however, that any other day of the year I eat strict 20 gram carbs. So, no birthday cake. No wine. No sugar. When a colleague shares food, I decline polite. If I eat out and there are no keto friendly options, I only have a coke. I will put something in the microwave at home afterwards. Friends and family get used to that after a while. 

In the category 'treats"" (keto friendly in macro /kcal), I don't do that during the week but only on Friday evening and Saturday. Some almonds or cheese for example, around 25 grams."
keto,"***Firstly, thank you for sharing your experience with the group. Second, it can be said that the best diet is one that you can stick to. The issue is willpower, and lack of weakness in the face of an appetite for food.***"
keto,"Truuue.

keto,Heat renders fat. No way around that. It doesn't drain off like a grill so the fat stays on the cooking surface. If you want to keep it in the meat then go for it. It will be liquid fat but its still there....
keto,Thanks so much!!  It‚Äôs great to be part of this community!!  Have a great day!
keto,That is interesting!  You won't get any igniting on one of those!  Would they fill up with grease with 70/30 or do you think the fat will stay in the burger more on a griddle?
keto,Good point.  It is lean by the time I eat it anyway so I am probably going to get a different ratio next time I order.
keto,Put foil on the grill
keto,Im a black coffee kinda guy but I‚Äôve tried butter blended in coffee and it‚Äôs delightful. People fill their mugs with awful creamers full of soybean oil and other bullshit. Better off with butter if one needs something to cream it up
keto,"That's true, I must be losing a ton of fat based on how much is igniting."
keto,That‚Äôs awesome!!!!  So happy to hear that!!  Keep up the great work!!!!  Please stay in touch!  Enjoy the rest of the week!  Take care üòÑ

keto,"20g net carbs guarantees ketosis. 

Anything over that is not a guarantee. Could you still be in ketosis with 50g net? Maybe, maybe not. 

This is why we recommend 20g net or less. It‚Äôs also why I‚Äôm not a fan of Factor 75. 

That being said, if your goal is to lose weight then remember: ketosis does not equal weight loss. Calories still matter and you‚Äôve got to eat at a deficit to see the number on the scale go down. If you are eating 50g net carbs a day while at a healthy deficit, you are on the right track to lose weight. 

Do what‚Äôs best for you and your goals. You don‚Äôt need carbs at all though, otherwise the folks over at r/zerocarb would be dead."

keto,Great Job! Keep up the good work.
keto,"I wouldn‚Äôt call delauer ‚Äúone of the better ones‚Äù, he is actually a bad source of information."

After some experimentation, I personally notice bloating if I go much over 25g in a day."
keto,"Ratio of fat to protein is irrelevant. Plus, if all the fat is melting off and causing fire issues, then you aren‚Äôt eating it so there is no reason to use 70/30. You could use a leaner cut and get the same amount of protein and fat."
keto,Since 2009. Minus my pregnancies.
keto,"What you have been reading is wrong. There is no requirement to eat any carbs. So long as you eat 20g of net carbs or less, you are in ketosis. Above 20g and your mileage may vary. Above 50 and the vast majority are not in ketosis."
keto,"I will definitely look at them.  I had followed a plan by Dr Eric Westman, Duke University and since then I noticed his group 'Adapt your Life' has also released an snack bar for keto.  He's been keto himself for over 20 years and I'm in my 3rd year, down 130+ pounds, 10 sizes and off of 11 of 12 prescriptions.  Keto has been a life altering experience for me for sure.  2 1/2 years ago I was a morbidly obese fat lady, depressed, feeling sorry for myself and waiting to die.  Now I'm 66 going on 35.  Keto ON!"
keto,"Im new to keto and I cant understand how one can put butter and oil in your coffee, that is repulsive to me. Surely you can get the necessary fat from your food with mayo or cooking with some extra butter. This subreddit seems to be more reflected that keto isnt just about eating as much fat as you can, but actually minimalizing carbs and have a calorie deficit. Some youtubers, even the better Keto ones like Thomas DeLonge or whatever his name is really seems to be on this fat at all costs intake.

I had a spoon of mayo with my dinner for 4 days straight and now I literally wanna vomit when I think of mayo, I put the Hellmans behind everything in my fridge because I couldnt even look at it."
keto,I conceived two beautiful baby girls on Keto. They are perfect. My youngest is 9 months old. I wasn‚Äôt able to stay Keto during pregnancy but I was definitely keto at conception.

keto,"I needed to hear this. I‚Äôve been in maintenance a while, and it‚Äôs not just the carbs creeping up lately but the calories too. It‚Äôs so easy for one square of dark chocolate and one tablespoon of peanut butter to become two of each, and once you‚Äôre used to that, to wanting something sweet after every meal. And yes, three meals a day is usually too much. One thing that‚Äôs helped me is having berries and Greek yogurt or unsweetened whipped cream around all the time. A small dish after my first meal (either a late breakfast or early lunch) satisfies the sweet craving in a healthy, keto-friendly way. Usually tides me over to dinner."
keto,"I cook with lite salt. I take no other supplements at all. 
I tried with extra magnesium and a multi vitamin, and without. My wallet lost some weight with the tablets, but it did nothing for my body. 

If I feel keto flu symptoms, I drink more water. If that doesn't help, I drink bone broth. = fixed.

keto,"I'm becoming one of those obsessed runner types - I love it, and I love seeing what my body can do now. It's motivating for sure."
keto,I'm with you and have a similar story.  Four months and my A1C went from 6.4 to 5.7.  I lost 25 pounds but would have lost more if I had recalculated my macros correctly back in February.  This is a way of eating I can stick to without feeling I am starving all the time.
keto,"You are so welcome! I too was at my heaviest weight ever and thought to myself, this is not how I want to spend the rest of my life. I knew what my goal weight was, which was originally 153 - lose 40 lbs, and I thought to myself how am I ever going to get there. I realized, one day at a time. If I started then in a month I'd be one month closer and hopefully see some results. Have not looked back once since! Good luck - I know you can do this!!"
keto,"It seems like a big step to take and how lots will change about your diet are there was just so much info and fasting and how many meals and all that.

I started on 3 but to be honest after 5 days it just got easier and I moved to lunch and dinner.  Keep yourself busy too - I'm at my worst for snacking in the evening so had to distract myself at first  but then are some cheese and cucumber slices and I was good.

Just take your time, do it slow, you don't have to do it all at once. And enjoy it.üòâ"

keto,"Read the FAQ section on electrolytes. I need 600 mg of magnesium, 2800 mg of potassium and 8600 mg of sodium. Any of those drop and I get headaches and feel like crap. Been keto for 13 months. Not much weight loss needed. 195 to 166 now."
keto,"Make your own! It's cheap, healthy. 

Dressing 1: Use mayonnaise as a base add water. 
Choose your own spices and flavours. For example;
1. Add tomato paste, whiskey, a sweetener. 
2. add herbs like dill, citron juice black pepper.
3. add mustard, salt and a bit sweetener. 
4. add pesto genovese

Dressing 2:  A good olive oil. Just add spices if you like (chilli pepper, garlic), or keep it pure with just some lemon juice. 

Sauce: Heat up heavy whipping cream. Add cream cheese till desired thickness. Add spices and things you like. For example: 
1. Mix some cheese
2. Parsley 
3. Pepper 

Once you have your versions, it takes less than five minutes to make the dressing, and ten to make the sauce."
keto,"Just had my bloodwork panel back and after being on keto for around 2 months at this point my numbers seem to somewhat high risk.

I‚Äôm still considered in the obese range (BMI at 30%) so could this be the sole factor of high numbers and just give it time?

According to the calculator https://cholesterolcode.com/report/ I‚Äôm optimal on the first test, high risk on second, medium risk on third."

keto,"Oooh boy can it. Still have headaches every day and no taste or smell, but the not being able to run and having no energy bugged me the most. Feel like I'm finally starting to get past it. Thank you!!"
keto,"Forcing fat into your diet is unnecessary.  If you are keeping carbs low enough and are eating a normal amount of protein with its associated fat, you only need to fill in with additional fat to satiation.  As long as you are not eating exceptionally lean proteins, that doesn't usually end up being a lot of additional/intentional fat."

keto,"Do people still believe this stuff? LOL. Keto has been debunked over and over. Gary Taubes is a charlatan and a drama queen. 

That said, if you do overeat carbs, then yes, you will certainly benefit from cutting back. It's called a calorie deficit."
keto,True - perhaps you will always need to consider calories is probably more accurate.
keto,I am absolutely amazed at how nice and helpful and just supportive everyone here is being. Thank you
keto,Grill leaner beef?  You are losing a significant amount of fat in the grilling process so you're not eating it anyway.

keto,"Sounds like ""keto flu"". Take a look at your electrolytes; sodium is usually not a problem since there's salt in everything, but you may have to eat more foods with and/or supplement to make sure you're getting enough magnesium and potassium."
keto,"If by try, you mean a small bite..you might be able to go under 20g of carbs. If you mean eating the entire dessert, then you're going to eat several hundreds grams most likely."

keto,"Yes, that makes sense. I just started, so I definitely need to make much needed adjustments to my diet. I‚Äôll cut down the fats, raise the protein, and check to see if that makes a difference."
keto,"Aha, but from what I understand, hormone sensitive lipase is inhibited by insulin, and can‚Äôt start B oxidation if insulin is lurking around.

keto,Be sure you put everything in an app. I use KetoChow. It‚Äôs not the protein that‚Äôs hard at first it‚Äôs the fat usually heavy cream. I split meals so it‚Äôs easier getting used to eating differently
keto,"If you're that worried about the calories you're better off finding nutritional information based on an average 4oz serving of chicken wings then. If you purposefully try to subject the bone weight you're most likely going to go over if anything.

keto,"Keto for weight loss does not need to be low-carb and high-fat, despite what Atkins says.  You're greasing the skids, so to speak.  Check out the FAQ and adjust accordingly."
keto,"Haha, unholy shits more like it. I saw some people saying 100 g of protein a day is fine, still have to find out my macros. I‚Äôll cut some of the fat out for sure. Thanks for the advice"
keto,"Calories burn fat, not the tiny bit of insulin that *may* crop up while drinking a sugar free drink. You need to keep your calories in check to lose weight. I was at 3-4 Coke Zeros a day when I was actively losing weight and I dropped 80lbs in 11 months. 

In the end it‚Äôs personal preference and experience, so you do what‚Äôs best for you. YMMV."
keto,"Sounds like a good start. 30g net carbs seems a bit high (you usually see it recommended to start by aiming for 20g), but if you see results at 30g then keep on doing what you're doing.

Many keto meal kits (and ""keto"" snacks and supplements sold in stores) have too many carbs to eat on a regular basis, so if you don't see any results I'd try to cut back there. Otherwise, you're on the right track."
keto,"I'm also Canadian (in Ontario) and love Costco for meat especially. Their quality is awesome compared to what is available at the grocery stores in my area. They also have more keto products than what I can find at other stores. I also love that they tend to carry a wider variety of healthy oils!  


That said, they don't have the same or as many keto products as in the US. I watch all these keto Costco hauls on youtube and most of that stuff isn't available at my Costco, so it's not as good as it would be in the US, imo.  


The other thing I don't love about Costco is how busy it is ‚Äî no matter the time of day or day of the week, it seems there are always long lines. Obviously, ymmv in Alberta :)  


I pay for a full membership for the convenience, but if you want to try some of the free hacks that others have mentioned, you can check out what's there and decide if you want to commit! It will probably be easiest to get value and reduce waste if you have room in your freezer."

keto,"Waaaaaaay too much fat. Cut out a lot of that fat, focus on eating more protein. I feel bloated with too much fat too."

1 egg
1 tbsp heavy whipping cream
1/2 tsp coconut flour
1 3/4 tsp Lakanto monkfruit golden (can use more or less to adjust sweetness)
1/4 tsp baking powder
pinch of salt
1 tbsp Lily's Chocolate Chips (I used dark chocolate baking chips)

Instructions
Turn on the waffle maker so that it heats up.
In a small bowl, combine all ingredients except the chocolate chips and stir well until combined.
Grease waffle maker, then pour half of the batter onto the bottom plate of the waffle maker. Sprinkle a few chocolate chips on top and then close.
Cook for 3-4 minutes or until the chocolate chip chaffle dessert is golden brown then remove from waffle maker with a fork, being careful not to burn your fingers.
Repeat with the rest of the batter.
Let chaffle sit for a few minutes so that it begins to crisp. If desired serve with sugar-free whipped topping."

keto,"The sparkling ice drinks and diet sodas aren‚Äôt going to kick you out of ketosis. They don‚Äôt have carbs. Too many carbs kick you out of ketosis. 

I drink sugar free drinks every day, and have for the three years I‚Äôve eaten keto. No issues at all."
keto,"Agree.  Costco is the best, but Publix is more readily accessible for me.

Not quite the same experience, but Pizza Hut's bone-in wings, (Cajun, Lemon Pepper, Garlic Parmesan, and Ranch) are &lt;1g carb &amp; 0 sugar per wing. They have wing specials on Wednesdays.  Sodium is a bit high, but that's pretty much standard for, ""fast food.""  IMHO, the Cajun are fantastic if you enjoy that flavor. Big, meaty, moist, etc.  Good stuff."
keto,Rotisserie chicken is the bomb diggity. Get you some of those Bob Evans potatoes and a can of corn. Best meal under 5 minutes.
keto,"FWIW, I've found that those perrier sparkling waters are good soda substitutes. I get a semi variety pack from amazon with half lime flavored and half regular.

I always have to have gabapentin in my system or my CNS is affected, but I take it on a much lower dose now than prior to keto."
keto,I use skinny mixes in iced coffee and sparkling water. They‚Äôre awesome. I really like the cherry in sparkling water and the dark chocolate espresso in iced coffee. Today Keto friendly. They also over some with MCT oil but I‚Äôm not in love with those.
keto,What are you eating. Remember fat is a limit not a goal.
keto,It's worth every penny not to have to pick the chicken.

Curious about if you're having to take medication for the diabetes or are free? Last summer I got the type 2 diagnosis and have been on medicine, but managed to get down from north of 11a1c to 6. I'm hoping refocusing on keto will get me down a little more and I can drop the meds

My Dr freaked when I said I was doing keto but couldn't argue with the significant drop to healthier numbers.

Also dealing with pressure and cholesterol, so here's hoping I can do it long term this time"

keto,"I mean just because you are technically tankier than the other dps doesnt mean you can really take a hit.  Youre by no means a Rein or a Orisa. Even Roadhog can take more punishment than a Bastion.  

Like I said his biggest drawback is him being stationary despite all his ""armor"" because it really wont help if you are focused by 2 or more players.  There is always a target on Bastion's back because he is stationary.  There is only so many places you can move on a map to even be effective as Bastion also since he needs line of sight to do damage. I get and use the idea of moving around but thats not always an option."
keto,"Dude I could care less if you ate your chicken in your own bed, I'll fucking do it too, juicy tendies in the sheets? Fuck off if you think I'll say no. I'm not saying that you're lazy, I don't fucking care to judge people because not only is it rude but fucking pointless, there are just things everyone does in their daily life, and making a big deal of them is slowing oneself down. Again, I don't give a fuck about what you do as long as it makes you happy, as that's the only thing that matters. 
And with that, I hope your chicken is always juicy, and you keep yourself happy.
Anyway, we just didn't understand each other right and I do tend to blow things up with my wording."

Do you not have some quirky habit that is absolutely harmless to anyone, including yourself, that you giggle at to yourself? Is it: You like to see if you can't fix things that aren't broken?

I mean normally I'd just smile and say thanks, but holy shit dude, you just like, called a stranger lazy and disorganized because you read that he likes eating chicken from a tray so he can avoid doing dishes, and then you decided to justify it by proclaiming how you cook at a ""professional level.""

I'm no longer craving rice, pasta, ice cream, cereal, and the like, but I find myself craving drinks a lot. Prior to going keto, I drank a lot of apple juice, orange juice, milk, soy milk, and almond milk. Now I limit mainly myself to water, seltzer water, or coffee with a splash of milk/cream.

I get so bored of waters and near black coffee. I've tried flavored seltzers and flavored waters, but they don't help. I tried heavy cream  as substitute for milk, but I ended up drinking a 16 ounces of heavy cream in one sitting. That defeated the point of heavy cream so I'm trying to avoid drinking it.

 It's not legitimate thirst either, because I can drink my fill of water and still crave a cup of milk."

I don't want you to just assume because of your history that that's what's going on and just start the gabapentin and ignore it That's the because in that case other minerals and vitamins can also go out of whack and have fatal consequences. 

The magnesium absolutely can cause the diarrhea... I'm not sure what supplement you're taking but excess can cause gi upset. However, again at this point the seizures concern me. Can't not be sure what the origin is at this point. Might be your history, might be a new onset from the diarrhea issue. 

Regardless, please be evaluated sooner than later. Worst case scenario you have a little blood drawn and everything's fine And you wasted a little time. I hope you feel much better soon."
keto,"Thanks dad.

You must be a hoot at parties."
keto,"If you‚Äôre cutting calories, getting electrolytes, and tracking as closely as you claim then keto probably isn‚Äôt the problem. You would scientifically lose weight just based on the calorie restriction. Have you considered seeing a doctor instead of a nutritionist? Might be worth it to maybe run some tests to see if anything is hindering your weight loss like thyroid issues, hormonal, pcos, etc."
keto,"Not for me. I eat a TON of protein every day. 

What exactly are you eating? Are you supplementing electrolytes?"
keto,"lol Chiro berg

Read the FAQ"
keto,"I do between 1,400 and 1,500 (female, already lost 36kg, want to lose another 15kg). I don‚Äôt worry about fibre.  I find my body actually does much better without a lot of fibre.   I have IBS and used to suffer from chronic constipation.  I watched some videos on youtube (Paul Mason and Zoe Harcombe) about how avoiding fibre can actually help with those conditions.   I do get some from veg but its not a focus for me."
keto,"The sooner you realize that washing dishes isn't even a hassle the more accomplished you will feel. Instead of avoiding, find the fastest way to do it"
keto,"Dad here but I do most of the cooking.  My wife is also doing keto, we often say how much easier it is with both adults in the house doing it at the same time.  Now my 4 year old is picky...  Those waffles or pb&amp;j's do look and smell awesome but I think about going hog wild on a ribeye and asparagus for dinner.  Kind of have to think about it like ""I'm going to track it either way and I would rather have the huge delicious meal and stay in my macros then have a bunch of junk that really won't satisfy"".  

I also agree with one other post saying to yourself that this is not my food.  I do IF usually skipping breakfast. My wife likes her breakfast meats.  I just set aside some bacon for a lunch salad.  It's hard not just tossing down a couple slices but I would rather have it with some chicken and avocado over some spinach.

Good luck!"
keto,"Lol! I was about to ask this question, but decided to do a search first - good to know so many people are desperate like me to find a keto tortilla option that actually tastes like a tortilla! :)"
keto,"Quick and dirty method, grab any cheesecake recipe you like and add up to 3 scoops of low carb or 0 carb protein flavor of choice lol. I use isopure 0 carb. Either chocolate or vanilla. 

I usually use a no bake cheesecake recipe like the peanut butter cheesecake from low carb yum. I substituted more cream cheese for half the PB because it was too much PB for me.

But from experimentation I have found you can drop the sweetener from any cheesecake recipe and add 3 scoops of protein powder without a significant change in texture or anything. The protein powder adds sweetness and flavor. So play around and find your sweet spot. I am going to try 4 scoops some day for fun, but 3 works for me. 

The most recent one was a basic salted caramel  cheesecake (no bake variety) using quest salted caramel protein powder. I dressed it up by dribbling torani caramel on top and a dusting of crushed pecans. No crust since I am not a fan.

This also makes amazing jello btw.  I made a cheesecake jello once that was odd but really cool... I dissolved my unflavored gelatin in a quarter cup of boiling water and the rest of the liquid was melted cream cheese and heavy whipping cream, which was half frozen. Ran through a blender with protein powder and stuck in the fridge. It worked. It makes a sort of foamy jello parfait type thing."
keto,I keep forgetting to roast the bones! I keep bones too but I just soupify them right away - and the roasted ones do make a better broth.

keto,Congratulations!!!!! I am so happy for you and so inspired to continue my keto journey. Do you have any favorite easy keto dishes that helped you power through the carb cravings?

keto,"I get it..6'5 260 here. I bought a mat and follow mens yoga guys on youtube. Do it for a few weeks (take break days like when you workout) and give it a shot, you won't regret it."
keto,Going into ketosis causes the body to purge and replace chemically dependant cells reducing the urge to consume a substance.
keto,"And use ""Sedentary"" no matter your level of activity. For weight loss you do not want to eat back the calories you burn or you're defeating the point of the exercise."
keto,Caaaaaan we have your protein cheesecake recipe? ü•∞
keto,Outstanding!  Keep it up üëçüèª.
keto,OMG I'd love to get a bag of these - I just saw a recipe for a keto/ fake mac and cheese and it calls for porkrinds on the top and that flavour would be \*awesome\*... I wonder if I can get them in Canada...
keto,"Seems accurate to me. Can you give something specific so we can understand what you're referring to?

Keep in mind that food labels round values so if you're comparing 100g in one place to 50g in another and just doubling it, it could be a mismatch because the 100g portion would have to round 0.8 per 100g up to 1g whereas the 50g reported portion would round 0.4 per 50g down to 0g carbs.  Now carry this over to fiber that's being subtracted and it gets even more into ""fudging"" the numbers."
keto,"Been keto over 2 years and my appetite never came back at all. Most people's comes back over time.

In my case, I eat regardless of lack of hunger. I eat when my hubby eats. If he isn't around, I eat when he gets home. If he will be gone for more than a few days I set alarms on my devices and eat when they go off.

The first time ever that maintaining weight is harder in some ways than losing it lol.

That being said try going up to 40g net carbs, basically the historic T2D recommendation and see what happens there. Or, make a protein shake with heavy cream a part of your day. Or a pint of rebel ice cream or other real ice cream. 

I make amazing protein fortified cheesecake for dessert now and then. A mini cheesecake bite has a decent amount of protein and around 150 calories.

On my worst days I snack on my prepared food all day, a bite or 2 here and there. I manage to finish it."
keto,"If it fits your macros, then the choice is yours based on any other health concern you may have about it's ingredients completely aside from keto.

The only keto-related risk is that the artificial sweetener could trigger craving for real sweets but that's very subjective so only you can determine that."
keto,"You look like a new person!

Well done. Bet you feel amazing.

Proud of you."
keto,Good job. That is a healthy looking tummy!
keto,"I am under the impression that since alcohol immediately turns to sugar in your body, not only will it throw you out if ketosis, those sugars should be counted as carbs.  

Am I wrong?"
keto,"Can't drink all that beer on keto. I do not drink that excessively, but I have switched to 2-3 Bourbon instead of 2-3 beers. 
What really sucks is I'm a brewer that's gonna start in a new brewery soon. I hope I hit my target loss by then."
keto,Lol. Not my style but I respect the hustle
keto,"I‚Äôve never found any real issues with it, it‚Äôs the most accurate of any other app I tried in the past. I‚Äôve been using Cronometer for three years. :)"

keto,That's good news. Walking is good for the soul.
keto,"If you are at the weight you want to be, it is time to get into maintenance mode and slowly up your carbs. Try 40-50 carbs and if your appetite doesn't improve, up it a little more.

I'm going through the same. I am about where I want to be size and weight wise so I am going to stop IF, and add a few healthy complex carbs instead of staying under 20 daily."
keto,What‚Äôs ketoaid? Link?
keto,"But, alcohol also turns off the liver‚Äôs ability to synthesize glucose (gluconeogenesis) and so you‚Äôll use up alcohol and glucose as energy while drinking. I would think you would still produce ketones if you‚Äôre fat adapted; your body wouldn‚Äôt have any other choice once the alcohol is burned up."
keto,You should check out the stop drinking sub. So many wonderful people there. Non judgemental and very supportive. Good luck!

keto,"It's funny you mention it because i've been thinking about it a few hours ago.

I was borderline alcoholic when i started keto, and even though i did drink, i haven't been feeling like i needed to.

That said, once i start, i do binge and just earlier i was ready to eat up a full dried sausage but i managed to stop myself before i even started.

I reeeaaally want to eat it though, lol.

The point is i realize it is necessary for me to quit it for now.
At least until i reach my goal weight.

I don't know if it's the low carbs, but it's amazing how much control over myself i feel i have since i started.
It's not perfect yet, but i'm heading there."

keto,"Oh well try the calculations in a macro calculator based on your current stats including activity level.  That might help.  I'm 5'9"" and started at 297 pounds.  Even then my calories came in at 1491 at the time.  I also recalculated with every 10 pound loss.  Smaller you, smaller requirements right?  I have heard that gals that suffer with PCOS struggle to lose.  I don't know if that applies to you and I really don't know much about it since it was not an area of concern for me.  Good luck."

keto,"So, the admins deleted a comment, but not before I read it and tried to respond.  Thank you admin, feel free to delete this too! When we make ourselves vulnerable, this is the kind of backlash we get.  And I was fully prepared...  here's what they said:

*""God this is such garbage, you‚Äôve replaced your ‚Äúcarb addiction‚Äù with an addiction to Keto and the bible it comes with. The reason you lost weight was because you focused on your diet - it was not Keto or curing your ‚Äú carb addiction‚Äù.*

*Keto is fine, but the results are Correlation not causation. The reason you have been more strict with this diet is you are putting way more effort into it, you are buying books, participating in groups, preparing for a keto diet takes lots of preparation, so you have invested all this time and energy, so you are more likely to succeed.*

*Make sure not to put this much credit to a diet, you did this. You were and are right obese, you are likely 30-35% body fat. Once you have that under control will you still keep this up? Like no, that is the problem with keto.*

*Keto is a good trick for loosing weight because people focus so much then credit ‚Äúketo‚Äù. It is not a healthy lifestyle, eat lots of vegetables, all that fat is not good for you, a balanced diet, not much meat, lots of vegetables, variety and flexibility is the BEST diet. Sadly that does not have a cultish following, reverential books, just works. Learn to address the core issue of you being obese, and eat a normal diet, with less calories then you use and you will be your healthiest self.""*

Here's my response (because I won't cower):

**It's not a cult. This is not garbage. It's not a trick.  Why are you even in this thread? So, I put myself out there, all vulnerable-like, spilling my heart and this is what I get? I'm not going to explain what it was like before quitting carbs. I don't think you would understand.  You sound like one of those people that Gary talks about in his book - someone who thinks that it's easy to lose weight by just 'undereating'.  -me**"
keto,"Functioning alchy here. I have been drinking less during my experience with keto.  My tolerence has been shattered. I'll have 2-3 hard seltzers, that gets me buzzed, then a couple whiskey/diet cokes and i'm good for the night. My other problem is staying up and watching tv all night lol."
keto,Dangerous?  What gave you that idea?  Carbs are a non essential nutrient and we don't actually need any.  Lots of people do carnivore with zero carbs.
keto,"Huh. You learn something new every day. I avoided a lot of malitol anyways because it hurts my stomach if I eat more than a serving or two. But didn‚Äôt know you calculate like this. 

Thanks stranger. Usually just buy the stuff because it‚Äôs cheaper than most. Will reconsider now. 

Thankfully hasn‚Äôt stunted my progress, but will keep an eye on it"
keto,That's exactly what I am confused about....
keto,"&gt; 70 lbs lost

Nice !

&gt; PKCD

Do you have lots of kidney imaging that shows lots of cysts ?

It would be interesting to hear if your PCKD imaging improves after a few years on Keto.

&gt;Since I never go deep into ketosis regardless of restricting carbs or protein

Neither do I.    I have to fast to get to 1.5 even.
Ive never tried protein restriction."
keto,I haven't tried keto in a few months so this was the calculation awhile back. I also got these macros from a keto facebook page.
keto,keto leads to confidence/happiness which is one less void to fill with alcohol?
keto,"Not sure what you mean by ""keto diets.""  There is low-carbing, and then there is keto.  Low carbing is like following the South Beach Diet.  Keto is that, minus the healthy carbs, like fruits and grains.   Keto you eat more lean meats and veggies, and good fats.  SBD you can eat more healthy carbs, like legumes or a low-sugar fruit.  

SBD is less restrictive, so you can have a 1/2 cup serving of some pinto beans or an apple...  Low in fats.  

BUT Keto lets you eat more sinful things, like heavy cream and butter and high fat 'keto' ice cream.  High in fats."
keto,Well if you've always kept your calorie intake that high it seems to me you might try lowering it.  Are those macros calculated on your current stats?
keto,"I agree, it's a conceptual repeat but laid out slightly differently.  I think that I had selectively forgot a lot of the details from the Case Against Sugar, and found that re-reading really helped me launch into Keto.  It was great timing :-)"
keto,"Looking amazing.

Keep it up!"
keto,"I don't know anything about the quality but I don't like the taste of the boiled bones either.  I roast them til they are toasty brown.  I throw in an onion, a head of garlic and a celery stalk with about 2 tablespoons of ACV.  I then cover with water and pressure cook for 4 hours or until those bones have nothing left to give.  I don't know if that's helpful but just the boiled bones make me gag.  I use whatever bones have accumulated in the freezer."
keto,"Longtime whiskey drinker. I actually drink more since being on Keto. It probably has to do more with work stress than keto, but I feel like there is some sort of connection for me. I don‚Äôt ever drink more than 4 in a night, but usually 2-3. Haven‚Äôt had hangover issues. I don‚Äôt ever drink wine or beer. Mostly whiskey and rums that I‚Äôve confirmed have no sugar added."
keto,"Thanks. I've been trying Keto and it's true I'm not finding myself hungry but I do feel deprived. I don't eat meat so maybe that makes it harder for me  since there are fewer options. I also have hormonal cravings and it gets frustrating not being able to meet them. I mostly ate keto style meals anyway but I miss little snacks, simple things like dried fruit. But I'm testing out the diet and hope if I see some weight loss that it will motivate me. So far it's only been about a week and I don't see any change yet. I've had nothing but cheese, non starchy veggies, fish, eggs, cream, and a few nuts."
keto,Great Work Bro!!!
keto,"I do feel duped as well.  The first 'diet' book I read from an IT person called the Hacker's Diet.  One of my friends lost weight, so then a group of us tried it. Yes, it was a short-term fix. But then we kept gaining/losing by counting calories. And then...we have to undereat our WHOLE LIVES???? Wow, no THANK YOU.  I'm so happy to have found a better way of eating.  Message me anything good you find in the book...looking forward to hearing more."
keto,I sleep between 5 and 5.5 hours a night. But I will definitely ask for the thyroid to be part of the test.
keto,"Used to drink damn near everyday, maybe even subconsciously.

Since being on Keto, i only drink on weekends, and at most 4 liquor drinks. Almost to the point where I dont even enjoy alcohol. Big change for me"
keto,I find IF to be easy for me. My fasting window is roughly 7pm to 11am. I eat lunch and dinner. I also found a timer tracking app that helps me incase I have to eat a late lunch or late dinner one day.
keto,"Makes sense. Your body retains 2-3 grams of water for every gram of carbohydrate (glycogen) it stores. If you were already slightly dehydrated from the alcohol and the carbs took up a bunch more water, I can see how that would make you feel crappy."
keto,Is that in Canada or the States.  I've been ordering pork rinds from Buster Rhinos.
keto,"Shedding muscle is unavoidable with any calorie deficit diet, not just keto. But yeah."
keto,Yes.  I was always more concerned that I was the fat lady in the room than I ever was with my poor health.  What a distorted view.  It's like 'look how great she looks laying in that coffin'!  I mean who cares at that point.  It really says something crazy about what is important in our society.
keto,"Don't worry, I'm not offended. ü§úü§õ"
keto,"That is outstanding, great dedication!"
keto,"I used to drink a lot of cider - I'd buy enough on a Friday to make sure I had enough to last the weekend - a bunch Friday night, a bunch Saturday night and a few Sunday night. This almost always resulted in me overbuying, so I'd still be drinking come Monday/Tuesday. Sometimes I'd even go in the week to stock up.

I was never an alcoholic - only had them because I enjoyed drinking them, tasted amazing etc. Obviously on keto, cider is out. I don't miss it. I've not even had any spirits for around a month or more. Last time, I had a couple of vodka and Pepsi mixes and then just literally didn't want any more. Weird.

&amp;#x200B;

The constant trips to the shop for more cider ended up costing me ridiculous amounts of money too as I'd invariably spend the same again on junk food whenever I went. That's the reason I could never save money, I'm so much better off now, physically and financially."
keto,"This happened to me in the beginning also the only difference was shark week was headed my way. I lost 5lbs in like 4 days.. gained 4lbs back the following week. My feelings were hurt lol. 

Definitely pay mind to your potassium, sodium and magnesium intake. They make a difference as does water. When you say 5k.. do you mean steps or miles? If it's miles try doing 3 miles instead. 

Of course up your water if need be. Like others said though, the weight gain is typically normal especially for women. 

Congrats on your 2 weeks!"
keto,"Amazing job, KCKO."
keto,I am no doctor but I took meds for high blood pressure for 20 years.  After 6 months keto I no longer needed to and my doctor was mystified as to how I got my BP down.
keto,"Agreed. If what we are doing is what works best for us, and we are better off than we were before we made the changes to our diet as a whole, then it is definitely something that shouldn‚Äôt be labeled. I am with you on being formerly known as the fat one in every group and now I am content to just blend into the crowd, completely unlabeled. :)"
keto,"Haven't tried it yet, but there are a few types of sparking hop water like [this](https://www.totalwine.com/beer/nonalcoholic/specialty-beer/lagunitas-hop-hoppy-refresher/p/223152134?s=511&amp;igrules=true) I think might really hit the spot with a chaffle taco in the summer."
keto,"After going from 265lbs to 117 lbs, then maintaining that for several years, at 40yrs old I had this procedure too; with the added addition of muscle tightening (lower body lift , breast lift/reduction, neck lift, lower face lift, tummy tuck). Dramatic weight loss leaves some of us looking like we melted or share dna with a Bassett Hound. Over 6 lbs of skin was removed. Wish I'd gotten the thighs done too. It was a painful and expensive surgery . After 3 years, I'm still recovering. I don't know if you've done it yet, but I wish you the best of luck and advise taking amino acids (Perfect Amino) to aid in tissue healing and prevent tissue death after surgery."
keto,I never liked those labels either.  It's sort of derogatory to say someones eating clean or dirty.  Keto is keto period.  Perhaps it's better voiced as something like 'I'm doing keto but have chosen to do non dairy because of inflammation' or something like that.  The word 'dirty' has such a negative vibe to it.  I use the terms because they are recognizable to others. but I always felt it could be voiced differently and in a more constructive or positive way.  Someone else mentioned that people who say they are doing 'clean' keto are placing themselves above others or feel superior.  I think as a former fatty I have had quite enough of feeling inferiority and it's tough to lose weight by any means.  These negative terms don't feel helpful to me at all.
keto,"It's normal.

Quit worrying."
keto,"You're looking great! As others have said, It looks like you earned back at least 15 years.
You hair also looks beautiful in both pictures.
Thanks for the motivation!"
keto,"Totally! I like a plan that just tells me what to eat and what to avoid...i don't want to have to be a scientist myself....makes it too hard and I'm busy.. This plan was good for me, they make it straight forward. xxx"
keto,I believe keto is low carb not zero carb. I did zero carb for a month. The reason I‚Äôm back on keto is I felt angry all the time and tired too.
keto,"I like to make chocolate mousse with HWC. 

1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

I haven‚Äôt tinkered with the recipe yet but I made them with the coconut oil and I think I‚Äôll swap it out with butter next time just to get a more profound flavor."
keto,Thank you!! Staying busy is good advice. Keeps your mind off it. I chugged two water bottles and felt a slight improvement. My pee has been super clear though (TMI) so I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm dehydrated?!

keto,"What is canned chicken,we dont have it here. Is it shreaded, in chunks, sliced? It looks good"
keto,Welcome to substance withdrawal.  I know it's pretty rough.  Some people are over it in a few days and some a bit longer.  I think I was about 2 weeks.  Just get as busy as you can be with non food related activities.  It does end.  If you weren't prepared for this you may not have researched electrolytes.and other causes of discomfort as you adjust.  I'm sorry there is no way to 'make it better'.  I called 'the baptism of fire'.  Every day you make it through is one day closer to it being over.  Don't cave or all the discomfort you have gone through so far will be for nothing.  I guarantee it ends.  Hang in there.

keto,"Carbmaster is good. 3 or 4 net carbs for a 6 ounce cup, depending on which flavor you choose. Kroger, Fred Meyer, Ralph's and others in the same chain carry it."
keto,Have you talked to your nephrologist?
keto,"&gt;Friends of mine couldn‚Äôt not survive one week, and despite I have asked them why - I haven‚Äôt understood what was their main obstacle.

Most people don't want to change at the cost of not eating pasta, bread, and cake. It's a choose your hard moment and they choose being fat over cutting out low-satiation, high-calorie, hyperpalatable foods."
keto,"In the long term, keto and carnivore improve gout, but when you start the diet you can get a clearing of uric acid from the body, which causes temporary gout pain.  It happened to me, intermittently, and every time milder than before, until it stopped flaring up.  I had colchicine prescribed for the pain.

Also, be wary of folate/folic acid supplements, as uric acid is one of the end products of folate  methylation and you might be artificially elevating your levels.

Check out Dr Ken Berry's YT, he did a couple of informative videos on gout."
keto,Two Good for sure
keto,"Plain Fage 5% Greek yogurt in the big tub. I mix in SF Torani type syrups. You can use any powdered drink mix or Mio too. So much cheaper and less plastic waste than pre-made yogurt. The villainization of sucralose is so tiring. The sugar industry is behind most of it. I lost 90 lb using it and my gut is perfectly healthy. Maltitol is 50% absorbable, thus can raise glucose. Sucralose does not. The maltodextrin mixed with it does count as 0.5g carb per packet. I just ordered concentrated pure liquid sucralose (which has no maltodextrin hence is zero carb) online because I am shaving carbs wherever I can. The stuff at the grocery store isn't as concentrated and is more expensive. A tablespoon of unsweetened coconut in the yogurt is nice too."
keto,"Having tried both Two Good and Ratio, I can certainly say the Ratio is far tastier.  Its very thick and rich.  I still quite like Two Good as well though.  I can't speak to the difference in sweeteners.  The Ratio likely tastes much better because it contains a lot more fat.  80cal vs 200cal.  Since I'm doing keto for weight loss, I stick with Two Good to get my yogurt fix.

I've also tried some Kroger Carbmaster yogurt.  Its a lot cheaper and they have a lot more flavor variety.  It seemed quite watery/runny to me and the carb count was on the higher side as well."
keto,"I agree, and the high fat high carb combo is what causes the trifecta of high LDL, low LDL and high Trigs.  There is no data out there to suggest that high LDL with high HDL and low Trigs cause or are indicative of any disease whatsoever.  In fact there is data to suggest the opposite.

keto,Thanks for all of the info I am looking into all of the things you mentioned. Beans are a great idea for that added fiber as well. Thanks so much.
keto,"Greens!  Spinach, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, beet greens, collard greens, spring greens, asparagus, arugula, Swiss chard, sorrel, vine leaves, microgreens, herbs such as coriander, parsley...  2-3 cups of a variety of these will provide both fibre and micronutrients."
keto,"Diet Coke is nice, but my go-to nowadays is sparkling water. It‚Äôs almost half the cost as Pepsi and Coke, and two ingredients (natural flavor and water)."
keto,Yes-I make a chia pudding with almond or coconut or macadamia nut milk plus my chocolate protein powder.  It‚Äôs my go-to when I want something sweet. üòã
keto,Have you tried carnivore (never tried it myself) but its the ultimate elimination diet and many people who do this heal all sorts of things. It is keto by definition as your not eating any carbs at all. r/carnivore

keto,"if eating chicken, make sure to not eat the skin."
keto,"I feel you, I hate to track. I waist so much time on the phone trying to get my macros flawless :O

As for the carb-y food yay! You can try to do some stuff yourself, with moderation, because keto treats lead to plateau. And the rest, focus on keto food you like and enjoy. For example, I love cheese. I fight my desire of tra
Donuts eating cheese XD"
keto,Thank you for the inspiration today! Youre an absolute babe!
keto,"Bad cook, if you do it, do it right, no middle ground, it‚Äôs the frequency that matters. I‚Äôll order one now."
keto,My pleasure! You got this. :)
keto,I got a waffle cone maker. Made thin chaffles that turned out great. I imagine that I can make toasted cheese sandwiches with sharp cheddar or any other cheese in the microwave using the chaffles instead of bread.
keto,Ahhh thank you so much for breaking that down for me! I‚Äôll start doing that today and I‚Äôll keep in mind that it will be a slow process. I hope this helped some others as well!
keto,"I have a drawer full of cute, small underwear I can‚Äôt wait to wear! Congrats to you!!"
keto,"Totally :) But hey, I wouldn't have made it a day on keto without them. For me it's choosing between obesity with a stellar microbiome, or a healthier body weight with a mediocre one!

And also on a diet that's already *highly restrictive*, I'm not about to cut out any more foods than I absolutely have to, especially if it helps (rather than hurts) my progress"
keto,"I usually just lurk but I want you to know how powerful these posts are. I just started keto because I shared your same feelings, I was shopping the other day found some flannels I liked, I bought them in the biggest size I've ever shopped for (4xb) and when they arrived my heart sank when they didn't fit. 

I see this and it helps me keep going. Seriously brotha congratulations and thank you!"
keto,Celery seed extract. Avoid/limit high oxalate foods. Both helped me lower my gout levels dramatically.
keto,"I‚Äôve lost 115, started a year ago too. Still have 50 lbs to GW. Are you finding weight loss is harder as GW closer?  I‚Äôm not losing as fast as initial, somewhat expected, but wanted your feedback."
keto,"Yes, indeed. Glad you took it the right way."
keto,"I love two good! Sometimes I just eat the unsweetened Greek yogurt from sams club. It has 6 carbs in a 3/4 cup but I usually have half a cup. I also like cottage cheese, those are normally like 3g per serving of carbs. 
To answer the sweetener question, I think the best ones to have are stevia and erythritol and monk fruit. The ones like sucralose and maltitol are filled with chemicals and have long term side effects that we don‚Äôt fully know about yet. 
And glycemic index matters because when you keep your insulin low your blood sugar doesn‚Äôt spike as much and you have fewer cravings and your mood is more stable. Hope this helped :)"
keto,"I find it's cheaper, if for no other reason that I'm eating fewer calories by not buying junk food.  Sweets and junk food are kind of cheap, but it's even cheaper if you never buy those things!

To be honest, if you're living on a frugal budget, starchy grains are the cheap option (there's a reason you'll see this question on AskReddit from time to time, and the answers are always things like beans, rice, ramen).  You can keep keto costs manageable by doing your shopping at Aldi and Costco, making your own jerky, buy your meat in bulk, things like that."
keto,"What you are looking for is to train your muscles to burn fat rather than burn glucose (muscles don't need to burn ketones because they can burn fat). 

If you remember back when you started running, remember that it took you quite a while to reach the level of performance you were at pre-keto. On your previous diet, you were training you carb-burning engine to be good and mostly ignoring your fat-burning engine; now you have to go through that same process to build your fat-burning engine, and that takes time. 

I'm a cyclist and a new runner this year. I do pretty much all of my runs fasted in the morning and they tend to be zone 2. A few weeks ago I ran a fasted half and felt decent energy-wise at the end.

My advice:

* Make sure that are really in zone 2 on your runs - you should feel quite comfortable at your pace and be able to talk easily. If you are getting out of breath, your intensity is too high and you will slow down your adaptation.
* I find it really helps to have more variety in exercise duration; my guess is that your runs are in the 30 minute range, and that's really not long enough to get the level of adaptation. Running for an hour at least once a week will help a lot, and if you can add it runs in the 15k range, that will be ideal IMO. 
* For most athletes, keto levels of carbs is too low from a performance perspective. Endurance running is a possible exception; there are ultra runners who are full keto, but we don't really see other athletes who are full keto. I've found that slightly more carbs - in the 50g/day or even 75g/day - helps a lot."
keto,"Counting carbs. I just can't bring myself to do it. 

I'm also struggling with motivation - with staying away from stuff I really like i.e. croissants, bread, pasta, and apples. I cannot not buy these things as I don't live alone. My child loves pasta and bread and apples, and if they are in the kitchen, I will eat them.

I've been trying to eat keto since the beginning of February to lose some weight I gained last year and I'm not very successful so far."
keto,"[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7269727/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7269727/)

&gt;Based on available evidence, a well-formulated ketogenic diet does not *appear* to have major safety concerns for the general public and can be considered a first-line approach for obesity and diabetes. **High-quality clinical trials of ketogenic diets will be needed** to assess important questions about their long-term effects and full potential in clinical medicine.

That's a review from 2020. There's just very early anecdotal evidence of newer ketogenic diet practitioners that show no risks. But all the literature until then, specially regarding Epilepsia patients that have used keto diets for more than 90 years, still points towards increased/dangerous levels of cholesterol and other effects caused by large intakes of animal long chain saturated fats.   
The only thing not well suported by the data (hopefully in the future will be) is the notion that saturated fats are safe as long as you don't combine it with large amounts of sugar/carbs."

keto,Happy first ketoversary! Props to you on powering through for a year and even bigger props for doing so during a pandemic!
keto,"Since you have been doing keto for a year you are likely pretty well adapted from a running perspective. You *might* be able to push that adaptation a bit higher with more zone 1/2 work; take a look at the Maffetone protocol if you want that. 

My higher carbs come with some beans, popcorn now and then, maybe a small amount of potatoes. Oh, and a bigger serving of blueberries before my breakfast."
keto,I suppose motivation is not a one size fits all lol.
keto,That was actually me being encouraging!
keto,Hmmm they‚Äôre not refrigerated in the store but i think that‚Äôs bc they go thru them so fast.  It‚Äôs not like a gallon of milk- more like a short fat tupperware container.  you could always divide them up between smaller containers for your fridge too.
keto,Intermittent fasting? no didnt do any consultation
keto,I know people on here recommend that even if you are working out you set your activity level to 0. My go to if the weight isnt coming off is you‚Äôre calories are too high. You might be eating closer to maintenance.
keto,"Blood numbers are part of CV health; they're not the entire story. If you've never had to see a cardiologist, it's unlikely you have underlying heart disease. Your GP in his office will never be able to successfully diagnose you with such."

keto,"Because it was an italian restaurant that served pasta/pizza? I asked them if they had substitute for pasta but no there wasn't any other choice. Sounds awful but at that time I didn't have any other options. Ofc I could have ordered some good steak but that was off my budget. 

Also I don't live in US, currently I live in rather small, northern town so I don't have as many options that other people may have. We mainly have sushi/asian buffets, basic fastfood restaurants, kebab+pizza places + ofc traditional local food but money is a big factor and unfortinately a lot of cheaper restaurants don't have the healthier choices. Also I was checking the list here and the problem with some of the suggestions is that some of these restaurants here don't have the same menu."

keto,"Are you working with a doctor on this.  Not just treating the gout, but about formulating your diet?  

And I agree that fasting might work better for you if (after consultation with a keto-friendly doctor) keto becomes unsustainable.  You can get many of the same benefits."
keto,"Oh that's so helpful and totally my story too.  Definitely looking these up, thank you so so much.  I hardly use reddit but this post just made it worth my while. :-)"
keto,"I loved the stuff, but could drink it down like water which then made me hungry and snacky so I bid farewell"
keto,I'm literally in the exact same situation I get gout everytime 2 weeks into keto. Just got over a bout of it after I restarted after a year off. I feel so much better mentally on keto and havr lost weight but I know gout is pretty much always around the corner. Speaking to my doctor to see what can be done and I've also been told to start allopurinol which I will soon. Hope someone has experience and an answer
keto,I bet on 30 minutes passing before some version of this comment arrived. But I'm pleasantly surprised by the extra 12 minute reprieve! Lol.
keto,"That‚Äôs fine. 12-14 is good (leaning towards the 14 side if possible). It isn‚Äôt until you get to multiple days of fasting before you expect to see LDL to rise.

I would recommend looking up the Low Carb Down Under YouTube channel, as there is a lot of good information there. Also look up Ivor Cummings, Dr Nadir Ali, Dave Feldman, and some of the others you see in that channel who have given talks on cholesterol."
keto,"I haven‚Äôt. I looked into it, but because they block absorption of dietary cholesterol and mine isn‚Äôt really a diet issue, I decided not to waste the money. Thank you for the suggestion, though. It‚Äôs very kind of you, and I appreciate the thought!"
keto,Withdrawal always sucks :(
keto,"Nice job, man! Congratulations on the start of your amazing (physics) transformation!"
keto,Have you done any fasting?
keto,I just chugged a water bottle and already feel an improvement. I go to orange theory everyday so I have a suspicion I‚Äôm highly dehydrated right now after reading the FAQs. I can‚Äôt believe it was something so simple lol.
keto,Ignore this crap. You‚Äôve got this. Follow the advice the others gave you about electrolytes. You will feel a world of difference. Once you sort that out you‚Äôll be right on track.
keto,"May want to check on r/ketodrunk (even though it‚Äôs nonalcoholic, they may have answers!). üôÇ"
keto,"I'm a sugar addict as well. Make sure you're getting enough electrolytes and if you still have cravings, put 1/4 tsp of salt into a glass of water and drink that. Placebo or not, it helped me a lot. You got this"
keto,"Feeling like crap is optional. The carb withdrawal is real but will get better over time, the fatigue, lack of focus, and sick feelings are easily combated with electrolytes. Aim for the amounts listed in the FAQ!"
keto,The shortages last year almost killed me.

keto,That‚Äôs awesome! I love aldi!
keto,FOMO with carbs? Or what you usually eat? I had to slowly give up a lot of food before keto. Now I‚Äôm working on giving up artificial sweeteners.
keto,"I would suggest seeing a therapist. If you're having obsessive thoughts around food it could be indicitive of a disorder, possibly. When you weren't doing keto, were you an emotional eater?"
keto,Oh... it is raw eggs
keto,"You can google egg skate recipes since I can‚Äôt remember all the measurements. It‚Äôs 2 eggs, heavy cream, ice, cream cheese, a little bit of sweetener, and a splash of vanilla"
keto,"1. Yes that's a good net carb amount, some people can have more and still be in ketosis.
2. People do it both ways, it's personal preference (the goal would be to find what allows your body to be in ketosis).
3. Low calorie generally is not good (hormone and metabolism issues). Use a few calorie counters to get a general idea (height, weight, activity level, current bf% are all considered).
4. Focus on progress, quality food, and learning what works for you (be patient and make this a long term change, not a quick ""look perfect asap"" trick)."

Keep it up!!"
keto,"You actually ""feel"" a whoosh? I just thought it's when you see a fairly noticeable drop in weight after a stall."
keto,"Why? The body can run off of both sources. It‚Äôs when you mix high fat and high carb the body has problems, aka the American diet. I think following keto or a high carb plant based diet probably has benefits. Frankly something similar to Paleo is probably the best since it still keeps blood glucose levels in check without restricting carbs heavily. And then there‚Äôs gut health where a plant based diet is probably better at since high fiber foods/resistant starches contain prebiotics. But again, paleo kind of covers that pretty well too just in the form of fruit. There‚Äôs benefits to lots of diets, but a common theme seems to be plants in some kind of fashion."

There was a lot of weird brainwashing bashing fat in the past. I was watching a show with a lot of outdated health advice that had a good chart claiming that a healthy diet must consist of sugar and carbs. That‚Äôs baffling to me."
keto,"That's normal, and why urine tests ask for the first ""catch"" of the day."

keto,"For the first week, won‚Äôt worry about any macros at all. Just get the rice, grains, sugars, etc. out of your diet. Don‚Äôt worry about fat either. Keep some berries and whip cream around and have a little when a sweet craving hits. You‚Äôll start to feel really good, will likely see some success on the scale, and the motivation will build ."

keto,"If you‚Äôre aiming for ketosis or not, you‚Äôd be healthier without it. It‚Äôs not like going into or out of ketosis changes the underlying nutrition of that part of your diet."

It‚Äôs dark in the morning and lightens up throughout the day."
keto,"I do not see you mention sodium. Get the full amount recommended in the FAQ daily, more if the cotton mouth symptom persists. I suspect it will not. In the meantime, drink some broth with added salt or some pickle juice, you should feel better. Hydration is a balance of salt, to hold water and the other electrolytes, and water."
keto,"So of those numbers, the A1C and triglycerides are the best predictors of a heart attack. Your current measurements are quite good. The next most predictive is your HDL which is still quite good. LDL and total cholesterol are dreadful predictors of heart disease (VLDL is actually somewhat useful but it‚Äôs not broken out on many blood lipid panels. If you can get it that would be another data point). 

A general practitioner was only given a few days of instruction on preventing heart disease and most of what they‚Äôre were taught is wrong. If you asked a researcher who works in the field what they would think of those values I expect they would be pleased. Good Calories, Bad Calories by Taubes has an in depth history of the science and predictive value of each of those values. 

TL;dr your numbers actually look good, LDL and total cholesterol are shit predictors. 

PS the clinical efficacy of statins is not very good."
keto,"What everyone else says about tracking. It sounds like you don‚Äôt need to lose a lot which sadly means it‚Äôs going to be a slog and a hundred to two hundred calories a day can be the difference between losing or maintaining. 

An aside, unless you‚Äôre using it for some other benefits, you might lose the mct oil. For me it was just extra calories."
keto,"The documentary ""Sugar Coated"" made the point that the low-fat recommendations came about because the Sugar Manufacturers Industry Association was worried, in the late 60s, early 70s, about new science data showing that there was a correlation between the rise in heart attacks and the increasing levels of sugar in the American diet.

They ""took a page"" from the tobacco companies, and ran a disinformation campaign on the premise that they didn't have to *disprove* the science that was being reported, just *cast doubt* on it. That campaign ran through the 70s, 80s, and I think on into the 90s as well.

It worked. Now we have an obese population with a myriad of health issues."

Is the goal  to be under 20g or is it to eat high protein, both, neither? Idk. I‚Äôll look up a food option someone says is keto and the carbs will be super high. How do people do this?"

keto,I mean. It supports her statement about being in constant fog lol.
keto,A serving is about the size of a deck of cards for those who don‚Äôt want to weigh
keto,Just the tip?
keto,I love hearing stuff like this. Happy to hear things are going your way. Keep up the good work. Sending good vibes your way üòé
keto,I've been drinking Santa Cruz Organics lime or lemon juice in my water. O cal/carbs/sugar/protein/fat. Is it really legit or is it secretly throwing me off?
keto,Blood test do not show keto flu levels of deficiency
keto,How many carbs are in that sauce?
keto,Rotisserie chicken! You can use it on salads or throw it on anything really. Or even eating it by itself with some sugar free condiments. Also I‚Äôll make a bunch of ground beef sometimes and have it for a few days also thrown on a salad with some quest protein chips to have a taco salad or thrown in a low carb tortilla for tacos.
keto,"I eat Salmon sometimes daily. I eat the whole fing can. Backbone, broth, the whole 9 yards. Love it. Not all brands are equal though, unfortunately."
keto,TwoDerville!
keto,"I also have a neck that is blacker than the rest of my skin and my demartologist said that it is a sign of too much sugar in my body. And that I am also a candidate to become diabetic.

I gained about 20 kg since 2014. And before that my neck had a normal color."
keto,"After lifting I come home and eat a massive salad and a raw salmon steak, weighing anywhere from 7.5-14oz Monday through Friday, I've done this for the last 5 weeks and I have had no ill effects.  I buy the salmon, typical farmed Norwegian salmon steaks, freeze them and defrost one of the steaks before I leave for the gym and it's ready to eat  when I get home 2-3 hours later.  I've always eaten a lot of fish before my salmon phase it was 12oz canned tuna in various ways.  I personally prefer it as my protein of choice and have be we encountered any issues with mercury.  Hope that helps!"
keto,"I was nervous to post this, but you make me grateful I did. Sorry if this is keto 101 issue ha. 
I appreciate your words."
keto,"That‚Äôs awesome.  Started at a similar weight, it gets even better!"
keto,"There‚Äôs your problem. You‚Äôre eating too much, which explains why you‚Äôre not losing weight. 

It takes me five minutes a day MAX to log all of my food. It‚Äôs not as time consuming as you think. Your results are only going to be as good as the amount of effort you put into this."
keto,That's awesome! Good job on keto!
keto,Thanks again!
keto,A food scale costs less than that package of chicken. Maybe buy one.
keto,Stats? Macros? Food scale? Tracking app?
keto,"I don‚Äôt track a thing. I just know I don‚Äôt eat a whole lot. 
I ASSUME I eat no more than 1300 calories a day but now that I really think about it maybe I eat a little more than that. 

I‚Äôm just uninterested in being on my phone all the time logging everything I eat, but I guess I should try."
keto,This is not related to keto.
keto,Also the rest of this post is a fucking mess.
keto,"Did you read the FAQ? https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq

Are you getting 5000mg sodium, 1000-3500mg potassium, and 500mg bioavailable magnesium daily?

If the answer is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how many mg I am getting,‚Äù start tracking it.

Buy salt and salt substitute in the grocery store. You don‚Äôt need any fancy products or pills for sodium and potassium. Magnesium glycinate is very cheap on amazon to boot. 

All keto flu is, is electrolyte deficiency. It is optional. 

It can happen anytime you are deficient not just at the start."
keto,"Def need to lift weights for get any type of tone and everyone has that area that they wish they could change üò© can‚Äôt really spot fix things but can do weight lifting and bump up the protein to build muscle. Keto is amazing for fat loss but if that goal has been reached, may be time to bump up the protein and add heavy weights"
keto,Never heard of anything like this related to keto. Glad you are seeing a doctor.
keto,"No, they just got smaller until most of them were gone."
keto,Did they just fall off?
keto,"Just FYI on keto you will eat far more than 4oz.  Good to track via apps, though!"
keto,"I know the whoosh! It's like a whirring, and then a shot of dopamine or something. Happens about 3 to 4 hours after a meal. Feels really nice."
keto,Okay thank you. I‚Äôm going to start figuring out and tracking this tomorrow.

keto is more muscle sparing than high carb calorie controlled diets."
keto,"Keto eventually becomes a habit.  I am a work from home dad of an 18 month old and my schedule is more flexible than the wife's so I also make the food.  They just eat stuff that I don't, and they can have all of that flavorless cheap plate filler they like if they enjoy it.  Peasant food but I like seeing them happy.

Until you reach this level of lifestyle you have to PLAN.  Failing to plan is planning to fail!  Willpower is bullshit.  You need to have glass you can smash in case of fire.  Keep some cooked meat on hand in case you get hungry unexpectedly.  If everyone is going to have some dessert, maybe prep yourself a keto dessert for the occasion and keep it in the freezer until it's time.  You're an adult and that means seeing problems coming before they arrive, and taking action today to avoid the issues of tomorrow.  DAD POWER"
keto,Yeah maybe since Ive been on keto I‚Äôll see some changes in bp and cholesterol. I‚Äôll know when I get my labs done.

keto,"I picked up a couple 1 gal cold brew pitchers on Amazon and my girlfriend and I rotate them through the fridge. It‚Äôs a hell of a lot cheaper and we get to use higher quality beans. I only put a splash of heavy cream in mine, but if you want something more like sweet cream you may want to check out [Kitu Super Creamer](Https://drinksupercoffee.com/products/creamer/). It‚Äôs pretty good, and you can find it in a lot of stores or order direct."
keto,"&gt;That day would come around and I would ""mess up"" my first meal of the day and just set a new date for next week, then next month..

years ago i figured out a way to deal with this.  i set only one goal... *stay on plan today*.  it's short enough to be an easy accomplishment, and if for whatever reason i don't eat on plan then i have tomorrow to get back on track.

where i (still, 25 years later) struggle is that the ""start over again tomorrow"" part means i can easily fall into procrastination.  i need to remember to let the small victories build up back into real habits.

but like you, i'm not one to announce my goals to anyone.  i don't do the accountabilibuddy thing, because in the end nobody is going to do it for me.  this is my body, my way of eating, my responsibility."
keto,"Wow, we have nearly the same exact stats except I'm shooting for a lower number than I've ever seen in my adult life (130). What's your average monthly loss like right now? I've debated working out more often and intensely (only doing 1.5 hours twice a week right now), but also don't want to slow down the scale even more than it already has."
keto,"I found this worked for me. I started in Jan 2020, and told no one initially, not even my husband that I was going to get healthy. Eventually he noticed that I was skipping certain foods, walking every day and I told him that yes, I was working on changing my lifestyle BUT I didn't want to talk about it. 

I didn't talk about it with friends and co-workers until they started commenting on my huge weight loss - because of lockdown it was more noticeable as they hadn't seen me in a while.

I continue to work hard on my eating habits even after 80lbs down, but I still rarely talk about it unless asked and even then I'm vague about what I do. For the most part I've found people will ask about it and then instantly tell you all about their own battles with food or trying to lose weight etc so it takes the focus off me anyway."
keto,Maybe you have a salt sensitivity.  I have heard that some people do.  I was on HBP meds and cholesterol meds for over 20 years.  6 months keto and off of them both.  I eat 5grams of sea salt a day and no effect on the BP.  Everyones different I guess.
keto,I take donuts. Cake. I'll even pretend I'm eating. People don't notice. I've become a ninja.  I always find a discreet trashcan for that garbage.
keto,"yes I saw that.  I have an obese diabetic friend as well as my brother (both well over 300 pounds) that I suggested it to.  It was not an issue for me personally so I haven't read it but I'm going to just for informations sake.  I know a lot of what he says about fasting and autophagy, body set weight and insulin resistance is still being studied but a lot of what he wrote about seemed to apply to me and I've lost 130+ pounds, 10 sizes and off of 11 of 12 prescriptions so I try to be open minded.  I like to keep up with the latest science if I can."
keto,I don't eat any carbs at all when doing carnivore so no you don't have to worry about carbs being to low.  Carbs are a non essential nutrient so you don't need any at all if that's how you want to do it.  The calories is what drives the weight loss.  Carb denial just causes ketosis once you are down around the 20 gram mark.  It doesn't matter if you only get 5 grams or if you get none.  It's the calories that need lowering if you're stalled.
keto,Yes it is!!!!
keto,Thank you @jellyfishpopstar !!
keto,"I have read that you can tolerate more carbs when working out.  Supplements will not put you into ketosis but that doesn't really sound like what you're trying to do anyway.  I can't see that the extra minerals would do any harm.  You may even get into ketosis but if that's not a concern, why worry about it."
keto,Only if it‚Äôs drastically lower than the calories you should eat but that‚Äôs usually only if you‚Äôre stalling. If it‚Äôs working you‚Äôve got this.
keto,"I mostly lurk this sub and I Google A LOT of medical journals and any clinical trials I can find pertaining to my medical issues. This sub has been the biggest motivator for me as well as r/ketorecipes and r/ketoprogress

I hope it helps!"
keto,Thanks you are right. Don't know why I'd let some internet comment disrupt my regime. If it ain't broke don't fix it.
keto,Anthony‚Äôs Acacia gum powder works for me. Helps with cholesterol too
keto,Why?  because someone else says so.  If you're comfortable I wouldn't worry about it.  People can be so regimented.  It's like you have to drink X number ounces of water.  Do what works for you.  Are you losing weight?  Do you feel good?  I skip an entire day of food once a week and I'm sure there are those that would say that's not healthy but it's called fasting so I just do what I'm comfortable with.  I'm usually about 22:2 everyday.  I struggle to get enough protein some days so I drink a small protein shake that day.  I think you have to be comfortable with what you're doing to make it sustainable for your life.  No one else knows what that is.
keto,"I think scalpers buy them from Costco and resell on Amazon.

I cant for the life of me figure out why they are so pricy"
keto,Any good resources or online communities to follow to find keto motivation ?
keto,I understand what you're saying.  I had to commit to the plan instead of the number on the scale.
keto,"It's all about self care.  I was always making announcements and always going to start next week.  It just made me look foolish and like a failure.  It dawned on me that 'tomorrow never comes'.  So I just started.  and that's how I stay with it.  'The next time you put food in your mouth just leave of the carbs'.  I don't have anything to prove, I don't need anyones approval.  I need to take care of myself.  I stand alone.  I always used to hang on to my fat clothes for when I regained.  I was convinced I couldn't stay slim.  This time I've given everything away and bought a new wardrobe."
keto,"This is very interesting to me. When people know about my diet they then start noticing my weight loss, I instantly start sabotaging myself. Quiet success may be the way to go."
keto,Some would say it looks like fucking shit
keto,"Been combining keto with intermittent fasting. Truth be told, I am actually gonna forego the intermittent fasting portion in the near future. Not because I dont believe it is effective, but because I know that too rapid of weight loss can have rebound effects. I know that to be true for myself at least. 

I think being able to divide my calories into three meals instead of one or two is more doable at this time and I will not be depriving myself of caloric intake TOO much."
keto,Congrats!! Looser clothing is the best feeling in the world!
keto,"I love clothing SVs, belts in particular! Notch up those tighter, k?"
keto,"Yeah one thing to remember is that.. your brain constructs the images you ""see"". People imagine that our eyes and brain are like a window. That light comes in abd we just see it as it is. But that's not the case. Our brain constructs what it sees partially based on expectation, based on what we're focused on.. or experiences and feelings. 

That's part of why when we take photos of a beautiful landscape, they don't ""do it justice"". Because our eyes and a camera work in fundamentally different ways. Photographers are trained to make pictures feel more like what you would experience had you been there yourself. Also why we can sometimes see the progress in photos but not in the mirror."
keto," Hi Everyone!

My first actual post on Reddit.

I need to give you some background so you understand my situation.  
I'd love to start Keto, the effect it's had on some of my closest friends has been amazing and i know once i'm through the 'keto flu', my life will improve. I want to get my energy back and be the Dad i want to be.

I'm a stay at home dad of two young boys, my wife is the full time worker. We had a chat when we had our first child about who would stay at home and her salary was higher than mine so i gave up my career and have loved the last 9 years.  
However it's led to 'comfortable living' and i have really let myself go. I've also suffered pretty badly from the brain weasels as well as being an insomnia sufferer.  
Basically i'm obese, depressed and can't sleep :P

I want to solve this in stages. I'm thinking changing the way I eat is the first major step. However temptation is huge. I can't throw away or hide all of the junk as i'm the only person in the house undertaking this lifestyle change.

Do you have any advice for a beginner on Keto as well as ways of avoiding the temptations laying around quite literally all over the kitchen?

Thank you so much for taking the time to read through this wall of spam."
keto,"Ok, I read that for the first time today. It isn't really necessary to do it that way. I've never even worked up my macros before."
keto,"He also wrote The Diabetes Code a couple years after The Obesity Code, which also has some stellar info."
keto,Awkward. Maybe they want to help/spoil you
keto,"I've always had body dysmorphia. I have to use a scale and tape measure to tell how big I am. 

Seriously. I cannot tell. Depending on how I feel my brain will focus on different parts that are bigger or smaller and base my whole understanding off that. One day I might think I'm an xs and another day I might think I'm a M/L. I frequently buy the wrong size clothing because of it. 

Pictures help. Multiple pictures too.  Like lots of progress pics so I can compare side by side rather than rely on distorted memories. The scale. The tape measure. Sometimes the fit of clothing. It's the only way for me to tell how big I am."
keto,"Yup, carb restriction is what puts you into ketosis. So keeping good track of that is all you really need, and it‚Äôs just a bonus that it is free to do so. 

Unfortunately, keto is in a very fad diet state right now, so everyone out there is trying to make a buck off of it. That means you will see all sorts of things like meters advertised that are completely unnecessary and generally very expensive. When at the end of the day, keto follows the KISS principle, keep it simple Sarah."
keto,"Well done! I‚Äôve kept mine secret from everyone except for my daughter who cheers me on. My three close friends don‚Äôt even know a thing nor my other half! I‚Äôm empowered the more, just reading this! Thank you!"
keto,"Thanks, mate. I‚Äôve always had bowl movement issues that go away when doing keto. I‚Äôve done keto on and off multiple times over the years and always feel better when on keto. IF is something new to me."
keto,"I started December 15th at 260, this morning I weighed in at 242.  GW 175.  Staying the course.  Woooot"
keto,Thanks for all the replies
keto,Yassss!  Way to go!
keto,"Wow 20 lbs in 3 weeks? I‚Äôm super jealous. I lost 7 lbs the first week then this snow shit happened in Texas and my power was out for 3 days and then a pipe burst in our house so we stayed at a hotel for another week, so I gained it all back plus more ):"
keto,"Oh ok, glad I asked here before buying something, I thought this was standard practice in the Keto world. I am tracking my macros with an app so I should be good to go as long as I stay under my daily carbs?"
keto,"June infection and weird symptoms starting in July... It fits.

It's still a new area of research - this disease didn't exist two years ago - and I can say first hand it's frustrating to be asking questions that simply don't have answers yet. But the know more now than they did six months ago, and they'll be running a wider set of tests if they're looking at neuro/possibly Covid vs pure neuro. 

Wishing you guys the best in terms of answers, treatment, and recovery."
keto,Old Major used to be the best place for that! But then covid hit and they closed. The chef that was there opened another restaurant but I‚Äôm not sure what it‚Äôs called.
keto,"I'm in my 40s and have struggled with my weight since my midterms. I've lost and gained a 100+ lbs multiple times.

I was know as the big guy by the people that know me. Losing weight made me lose my identity. The problem was that was my identity because allowed others to dictate that.

I finally went to a mental health professional who helped me sort things out and deal with my issues. Still don't know what my identity is but I know I'm not the big guy and I'm much happier in my day to day life.

If you have the means to see a professional I highly recommend it."
keto,I was the same way. Just restarted Monday and so far so good. You can do it
keto,"People often do IF and keto at the same time because when you mostly eat protein/fat, you don't get hungry constantly because there are no extreme fluctuations in blood sugar and because protein and fat are more ""sustaining"" fuel sources. So, it's a lot easier to fast while on keto than on a SAD.   


IF is an easy way to lower calorie intake while also getting that ""full"" feeling after a meal, so if you are looking to lose weight and you can fast, it's a great combo. Definitely NOT necessary, and I doubt most people do IF because they think it will heal their insulin resistance.  


You can try r/ketoscience if you're looking for studies, but I'm sure you'll find that regardless of where you look, nutrition science is biased. There are no clear answers to the questions you're asking because there is a vested interest on both sides to provide answers that reinforce their own biases. Plus, there isn't much funding for long-term human trials relating to diet.  


For the most part, you'll have to rely on anecdotal evidence of people who have actually done it themselves. In this sub, you'll find plenty of stories of people who have done keto for a long time and have seen great results. You'll find the same (I assume) in communities for other ways of eating."
keto,Atta boy
keto,"Well, eat whatever you like except carbs. But it's also a mindset thing. I love having my diet on autopilot running in the background as much as possible since that allows me to concentrate on filling the foreground of my life with cool new experiences.

I can guarantee you don't remember the 1327th slice of pizza you ever ate. Abd realistically when most people really track their diets they find they follow the typical 80/20 rule anyway, in that they eat the same small group of foods all the time. You just notice it more when you have to pay attention.

But you can sub all kinds of stuff in that meal plan. View it as X ounces of any meat or fish. Y ounces of any low carb veggies. There is a whole universe of spice profiles, cheeses and cuisines to explore.

Most of the time I eat essentially the same thing daily. But now and then I get creative. Hubby needs more variety than I do, so he eats lots of random leftovers from experiments."
keto,"I make green salsa out of fresh serranos and its great.

I blend them with the canned La Costena tomatillos, a spoonful of garlic, and some cilantros. Then I add salt and usually some avocados and blend that too and put it on EVERYTHING. 

Seriously, tacos, hamburgers, whatever. So good."
keto,"I have the newest keto mojo. It motivates me to see the low glucose/high ketone numbers. It helps me make better food choices (I don‚Äôt want bad numbers! It would be like getting a bad grade or something!) And it‚Äôs useful if you want to see how certain foods affect you (especially with blood glucose, ketone levels will take longer to change after meals). It also keeps me from obsessively weighing myself (at least I get some data!). I‚Äôm a data nerd though. The meter is about $60, and the strips are about a dollar a piece. So testing frequently will get pricey."
keto,Exactly. I'll be sticking to the good old whole foods keto
keto,I already take 1g salt tablets and my cholesterol and bp is high from it which now I‚Äôm on a beta blocker. But it‚Äôs either dehydration or high cholesterol lol idk
keto,Ya'll I'm not keto but can one of ya'll with energy who want to argue the finer points come tell [this person](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/lricp4/headaches_and_brain_fog_from_ditching_a_terrible/gomtwnj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) that your body won't start destroying your muscle if you don't eat carbs? I appreciate your assistance in this matter. I did keto for a year a while back and it worked real wonders for a short-term solution to my weight-related pre-hypertension but I'm naturally hypoglycemic and was forced to leave keto behind. It's just weird to be forced to lengthily defend something you're not doing. Thanks for any help you can give.
keto,"I'm not an expert on keto rash, but that doesn't really sound like it to me.

Maybe some kind of food sensitivity? Wheat, perhaps?"
keto,"I think everyone has a different body and different metabolism and different tolerance.

I gained a lot of weight over ten years, but most of that was due to being on bedrest due to health issues that have since resolved.  

Even on bedrest, I only gained about 7 pounds a year eating my typical diet.

For me, Keto is a way to lose weight and get in shape. It isn't eternity for me, but maybe a year or so. 

I need to lose a total of 70 pounds or so and I've lost 45 pounds since October.  

I'm doing Keto because working at home cuts out social events and allows me more control.  Not eating out also ruled out the ease of weight watchers and some other diets.

I make one keto meal and eat it for a few days. Green curry, jicama enchiladas, etc.

I'm also rebuilding muscle in an effort to increase my resting metabolism.

I am not much of a carnivore, though, and I live in the South. I plan a couple of months a year, or every two years, of dieting after this and the rest of the time just exercising and enjoying my potatoes and queso and home made tortillas.

In other words, Keto is what you make of it. As long as your doctor clears you for whatever, you do you."
keto,What are your stats?
keto,"A standard walmart digital scale for people works fine for me. Especially since the food scale is the one that got me to my goal lol.

My food scale is also an inexpensive digital from Walmart, though I have an old balance scale in storage here too. 

BTW a dollar store tailors tape measure is a good tool too. I lose inches still despite maintains my weight well over a year."
keto,"Oh I‚Äôm so happy I‚Äôm in Los Angeles. He said he was going to look him up next time I‚Äôm not concerned with the price point I‚Äôm definitely going to try it out!! thank you so much for your answer, it was his boy, I have Aegis 2400mhz ram but when I tested without it, the question seems as dumb as spamming edragons. If you worry about cooling i recommend cleaning the ps3 and installed hen and multiman on it thanks for your help! it was because my graphic drivers were outta date. I‚Äôd err on the side (obviously taking it seriously and working on it daily) you can at least get auto switching profiles and game control."
keto,Technically heavy whipping cream is .42 carbs per tablespoon. Have you ever tried sugar free dairy whipped topping ?  Wal Mart carries their great value brand. 0 carbs and has a sweet taste if that's what you're looking for.
keto,Ugh that is a long time to have one! I‚Äôd go crazy. Have you had any treatments done to it?
keto,Costco and Whole Foods have been out for at least two weeks. Costco is a better deal and for some odd reason taste better but we can‚Äôt find the sea salt ones anywhere. I refuse to buy them from Amazon as they charge way more and a pretty sketchy looking
keto,Huh!! Who would have thought?? That‚Äôs awesome
keto,"That‚Äôs very interesting, I never knew that!"
keto,"Read and re-read the FAQ. Weight loss is nonlinear. Hit your protein, stay under your carbs and fat and trust the process. 6 days at the same weight isn't a real concern.

&gt; I've done even more keto than the first six. MCT oil avocado oil eggs Mayo protein you name it.

This right here makes it seem like you need to read the FAQ. There is no ""more keto"" if you're eating under 20g of carbs per day and you're alive, you're in ketosis. Your weightloss is controlled by eating at a caloric deficit and time."
keto,"That makes so much sense, about going past my goal to account for water weight. Thanks!"
keto,"If I look at times where I‚Äôve taken leaps of progress in my career, hobbies and general well-being...it‚Äôs always been on keto. There‚Äôs a lot to be said for crossover you get in terms of the discipline needed to stay on track. But it‚Äôs more than that, I‚Äôm physiologically more vibrant and life is so much easy when you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre dragging yourself through it."
keto,"I've been doing keto for a month and a half now and I've plateaued. I lost 4kg real quick then another 4 slowly.

 My weight can fluctuate a bit normally but even considering that I haven't lost any in 2 weeks. Any tips?"
keto,"Also look at Oat Fiber flour. I sneak it into recipes by subbing it for no greater than 1/3 of the almond flour. You may need to add a bit more liquid as well as the fiber soaks it up.

Lastly,  if you have an Aldi's nearby,  try their low carb bread. It is not a tasty bran muffin,  but it is full of fiber and works for me!"
keto,"Amazing progress! Can I ask - how do you know it‚Äôs the keto making you feel better and not the IF? I too plan to drop one or the other once I reach my goal, so I‚Äôm curious why you‚Äôre choosing to keep keto instead of IF."
keto,"I've had a similar experience. Started keto for weight loss and I'm surprised how much sharper my mind feels. I have more energy and I'm finishing my thoughts more quickly. I also feel less lazy. All I used to want to do was relax and I would talk myself out of doing things like going for hikes or even going to the store after work instead of my day off, etc. 

I'm sure it's just more general wellness, going from an awful diet to not eating as much trash probably feels like this to anyone, but keto is what got me there personally so I mark it as a keto win."
keto,"Understood, thanks so much!"
keto,It's tough because it's worth it.  Alcoholics don't move to non alcoholic beer.  They move to coffee.
keto,"I don't eat a ton of meat. You can drink shakes to make sure you are getting the fats and proteins you need.

This week so far I had cheese enchiladas a few times, green curry once, homemade salsa with fajitas and burritos, and then some snacky stuff. 

I am eating more meat than I was off keto, but it is more like half a small burger for a meal or 5 pieces of bacon every couple of days for a snack between meals.

I still eat way less meat than 90 percent of Americans and I've lost close to 50 pounds since October."
keto,Look up keto muffins. Or keto crackers. There are some that use psyllium and/or flax. Chia seed pudding is also a good one. Try on diet doctor dot com.
keto,"I track my intake w/ MFP and also record my macronutrients in excel on a daily basis. Have noticed my calculations (% fat, etc) have not been matching MFP recently."
keto,"For some people, the transition from carbs to fat burning can impact performance in the gym. By all accounts, it lasts for few weeks to a month. But of course some may get lucky, and not have it affect things at all."
keto,"From what I have read, your body will burn glucose preferentially.  So if you are eating carbs, you will be using sugar for fuel.  You will only start burning fat in the form of ketones when glucose is gone and glycogen stores are depleted.  The best case is that you are peeing out those ketones because they are not needed.  I have no idea if it is causing you harm, but from what I've read, I'm pretty confident that they aren't doing you any good."
keto,"Thanks for your reply, yes I definitely feel like I‚Äôm in that now. Will be tough but sounds like the only way to kick the cravings!!"
keto,"It took me over 4 years to lose 70 pounds. And I have maintained that loss for well over a year now. 

And I still don't see it consistently lol. I found what has helped is trying on new clothes once a month or so. When I try on something totally new, especially in a store, I see it right away. Pics can help too, as can video.

But basically, I have stopped worrying about it. I feel great, and that is much more relevant than seeing it. Sooner or later I may start seeing it all the time. If I do, amazing. If not, no biggie."
keto,Maltitol is great in that you learn REAL FUCKING QUICK not to have it lol
keto,Don't eat food that makes you want to eat more food if you are trying to lose weight.  It sounds like you have gotten into the keto junk food trap as most of us have.  You can start counting calories if you like to make allowances for it but if you want the cravings to go away you'll have to ignore them for a while and stop feeding them
keto,"The most lingering effect is appetite.  There's not really any ""long lasting"" effects beyond that especailly if we are talking about only 70g of carbs."
keto,The original atkins plan had you slowly reintroduce carbs to find your tolerance.  Many people do this.  Personally I just make allowances for treats when they are special.
keto,"Over 2 glorious pain free, med free keto years here. No IBS flares, no fibro flares. Happy camper. You could pay me to eat more than 22g net carbs, I know where that goes. 

I just wish I had found this decades ago."
keto,I feel like they should give me a free year for how much I recc their shit! ü§£
keto,"I have the Keto-Mojo meter. I find it very helpful. I check my glucose &amp; ketones on this meter.
It‚Äôs expensive though."
keto,Started Jan 1 at 343.4. This morning I'm 309.9. Down 33.5 lbs. I'm ready to see a 2 at the front of that number but I'm probably still a few weeks away.
keto,Right after you get up and go to the bathroom. Naked. Before you eat or drink anything.
keto,"Thank you for the suggestion! I'll ask my doctor when I go in next.

The last time my CRP numbers were sky high, I ended up having emergency gallbladder removal. That was a while ago though so not sure what they're looking like now."
keto,"Probably a bit of body dysmorphia.  Whether you're losing weight, building muscle, etc, everyone has some idea of how they look / how they want to look, and it's very easy for your visual perception to not match up with your mental.  I burnt a ton of weight using keto, then started building a bit of muscle and immediately the dysmorphia turned on, thinking my arms we're getting too big or weren't proportional, etc.  It's something that happens, but you have to just check yourself and at the very least remind yourself that your perception of yourself can be astronomically different from what someone else notices.  You're just in your head, as are the rest of us."
keto,Good job. I'm getting close to Twomorrowland myself.
keto,"Is it the ketones though? Might just be the electrolytes which most people are deficient in without realizing it (completely aside from keto-related electrolyte issues).  You might just try a simple electrolyte supplement and better hydration without the ketones and see if you get a similar boost.

Ketones don't regulate BP in any direct way.  The health benefits of a low carb diet can help manage high BP but artificial infusion of ketones doesn't reap those same benefits.  In fact, exogenous ketones could worsen BP issues because they are almost always bound to sodium.

Most supplemented ketones - while eating a carb rich diet - are just going to be urinated straight out because your body is already pre-tuned for a glucose based metabolism. You might as well just poor the supplement directly into the toilet and skip the middle man.  They're mostly a placebo."
keto,"If your doctor is willing to order a CRP you can see where your inflammation is at. I was seeing a gastroenterologist for ""IBS"" I was having pain in my left upper quadrant for years. He did a CRP and it was very elevated and he became concerned for cancer. Colonoscopy came back normal. I started keto and the levels went down gradually. My body was under attack from sugar and carbs. I was insulin resistant. If it wasn't for keto I know would have a ton of health problems. The CRP number can be a good number to focus at and makes you feel like you are more in control of your health"
keto,99% sure it's just the electrolytes but consider this: there as no evolutionary situation that the body would be in where it would have simultaneously high glucose and high ketones.  I'm not sure we have good data showing what happens in the long term.  In the short term?  You'll be fine.  People smoke crack daily and survive for decades.
keto,Welcome to 2021! Time to cancel keto for it‚Äôs sexism!
keto,Gary Taubes - Why we get fat: And what to do about it.
keto,"Well, definition is a given on this diet with the weight loss aspect"
keto,"Yeah, I usually limit veggies to dinner (which is were I have my highest carb intake). I also use atkins shakes for 2 meals a day though (makes it easier for work/running around)"
keto,"Nope been doing keto for over a year.. you need potassium magnesium and sodium. The powder I take has a 220mg sodium per serving, but because its a powder, I can add multiple scoops!!!!"

keto,"Thanks for sharing Sophie, I did not know that it's super interesting. :) Seriously 10 km per day is impressive! Congrats!!"
keto,I can‚Äôt find any of the brands I‚Äôm looking for in the app to add my meals. It used to be so simple and quick. Where can I complain? It‚Äôs pretty much useless at this point.
keto,"I didn't know Diets had glass ceilings now, lol. 

We do hate Soy, so..."
keto,That's a load of nonsense.
keto,"Agreed, except for the getting sick of something. I sort of think an analogy is music. That happens with pop music because it's really not that deep. But you can listen to your favorite bands over-and-over again. The same goes for food. We all have a handful of favorite meals that we don't get sick of. For me it's steak/broccoli. Could eat that everyday for the rest of my life. And I think about this kind of long-term... meaning I might eat eggs 10 out of 14 days, then not eat them for 3 weeks. I tend to repeat meals in the short-term for simplicity, and rotate/buy new things every month or two."
keto,"All I can say about Tinnitus is that it just truly sucks!! I am remaining hopeful that once I get my electrolyte situation on a more fixed path, the Tinnitus will at least subside a little bit. It's miserable. And like I mentioned in a prior post, the only thing that alleviates the symptoms is Marijuana. As much as I love Marijuana, I do not want to depend on it every night as a remedy to a ringing in my ears. Just seems to me that ever since I started the keto lifestyle, the Tinnitus has really stepped it up a notch. It's maddening at times. I hope that at some point you are able to find relief from it! My sympathies are with you!"
keto,"This covers the spectrum from a very simple approach to keto to what to do after to keep the health gains and keep the weight off

For me, if I eat non-keto food it is a planned day, and no more than a handful a year, if that, I avoid keto processed foods and sweeteners, some do fine with them but they make me have cravings. I do not eat food that makes me hungery or that makes me feel out of control. So, for example, I rarely keep peanut butter but can have almond butter in the house. I find sticking to protein and veg keeps me full and not craving. 

Also, I keep track of wegiht, wear tight clothes and belts and when/if it goes up a bit, I address right away. I also watched a lot of Dr. Rob Cywes vids after someone here recommended them - re: carb addiction, vulnerability to addictive behaivor, etc and I worked a lot on managing feelings in ways that have nothing to do with food, that helps a lot.

Getting another active dog might be fun and a reason for more walking again."
keto,Of course! Hope you enjoy it!
keto,"I used to track everything but now I really do just wing it and go off my weight. For instance I made a nice Indian lamb dish with tomatoes and made a side of chickpeas/cashews/coconut milk. I weigh myself probably 3-4x per month and keep a spreadsheet with the monthly average. Lately since I spend about 1-2 months at 136 lbs, if I weight in over 140 lbs, I'll just opt for a very low-carb week until that comes back down.

I think resistance training, high-intensity and sprinting is best for burning fat. The last few weeks I've been lazy but I usually try to do a workout everyday, but only 15-30 minutes and rotate muscle groups so I'm not pounding any specific area.

I can tell that I've gained a little weight and felt less energy since I've gotten away from that routine.

Like my weight, I track all workouts, haha. I'm a spreadsheet junky and have a health dashboard with these basic numbers... day of the month I worked out, avg monthly weight, and distance walked tracked with iPhone/watch."
keto,Hang in there you can do this. I got sober five months ago. Now keto you got this!
keto,Glad you liked it. I consider it affordable relative to things like magic spoon. Only thing that takes some getting used to is the odd aftertaste. I'm going to teach myself to make breakfast bars with this brand.
keto,"I usually have scrambled eggs, some type of meat, and either this cereal or birchbenders chocolate chip keto waffles for breakfast. Nets around: 57g protein, 38g fat, ~7g carbs and keeps you filled for 4 - 6hrs. If I'm really hungry or am going on a hike I'll throw in some Sola toast and which makes the total count to 12g carbs for breakfast. Definitely try it, 3g per serving is stupid low.  

If I'm in a rush one serving does a pretty good job to hold it down."
keto,"I got the isopure one as well. I don't have a Costco membership, so I got it from GNC. they price match with Amazon, so it's good"
keto,"Well I've only been at this a little over a year now, and still have a ways to go to get to my ultimate goal (10lbs at at a time and 10% goals to stay motivated), but I can tell you that I did make a lifestyle change and I took my time removing and replacing carby/junk food making these changes new habits vs just quit it cold turkey lose some weight and reverting to old eating habits. I didn't even really set out to do keto or even LCHF. It just sorta happened as I replaced with healthier options. Doing it this way was like a giant elimination diet and i was able to pinpoint problem foods for me. Yes, sugar of course, but also wheat, grains, milk/ice cream and some cheeses flare my eczema and make me bloat. I have sensitivities that I hadn't been able to identify so specifically before and now, I have found the best way for my body to eat and not be sick. I will probably add back beans and maybe occasionally a potato, but I am much healthier than I was a year ago and I know that the foods I was eating then are the reason so I'm here for the health."
keto,Me too!  Good book.  I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôm addicted to carbs.   Best for me to stay away.
keto,"depends on the serving size, but if people are being super strict then they gotta account for the carbs in heavy whipping cream and eggs aswell"
keto,"Well, that‚Äôs a bit sexist!  Lol.  If you like meat, veggies eggs and cheese this is a good ‚Äúdiet‚Äù for you.  And much more then this to eat too.  

It‚Äôs really a low sugar low carb way of eating.  I don‚Äôt mention keto to everyone, they often have wrong preconceived notions"
keto,"This! Packaged food, even so called ""keto"" packaged food is mostly horrid cheap crap with no fat or bad fats like soy and canola oil and lots of soy, wheat, and corn filler."
keto,"Yea I still love being creative and trying new things out. That's basically what I do... when I feel like I'm about to slip or make a bad decision, then I go for making something extravagant with low-ish carbs. I just find the more I do this, the more you become hooked on that kinda food. In general I try to limit myself to 15 grams max of sugar replacement, whether it's erythritol or allulose (which I've just started using). Another sweetener that I recently found out about it inositol, which is actually a form of vitamin B!"
keto,I use isopure and the vanilla tastes fantastic. I don‚Äôt drink it unless it‚Äôs a day where I‚Äôm not hitting my protein goals from meals alone. Next time I‚Äôm getting chocolate. I order it via Amazon and feel like it‚Äôs a bit pricy compared with o brands at Costco. Everything at Costco has so many carbs I can‚Äôt bring myself to change.
keto,I work at a grocery store and if you think men don't love carbs.... Every day you have grown ass men near their death bed that still have to have a box of cookies and milk before bed. And men's carts tend to be 70% sugar
keto,"I kinda agree with you. My dad and brother can do keto very easily, cause they love eating meat and steaks all day everyday to begin with. Meanwhile sure, I enjoy meat, but I also love the side of carbs it comes with and don't really enjoy eating _just_ meat.

Definitely not claiming this applies to ALL woman. It just fits for how me and my mom are compared to how my dad and brother are."
keto,"This is really encouraging!! I live in a third floor walk up and I dread just going to bring the trash down. Not just because I get tired, but because I get tired and want to use the handrail and I do not want to touch it right now!

I have a Ring Fit and have played around with it before, and wanted to try using it a bit more regularly."
keto,"I‚Äôve been sober for 5 years and Keto OMAD for 2.5 years. I can honestly say, I am the absolute best version of myself that I have been.

Something my sponsor told me: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt quit drinking for your loved ones, it has to be for yourself. You have to want it and own it. The good news is they benefit equally even though it‚Äôs for yourself.‚Äù

You‚Äôve got all the right reasons and motivation. You got this!"
keto,"Really great answer  


I have been drinking 64 oz of water per day and still thirsty - been driving me crazy  


I will try this. Many thanks."
keto,"No, my boss has been on it for 10 or more years and still turns heads at 50 (I thought she was way younger when I met her)."
keto,"Anecdotally, many women I know think being a vegetarian or a vegan in itself is healthy, so that's what they aim for. Men seem to have similar misconceptions but don't follow through as much.

Not that you can't do either of those things on keto (r/vegetarianketo and r/veganketo exist)."
keto,"After years of feeling terrible and in a fog, within a few days my body was like, ""Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!"" Really a night and day experience."
keto,"Yes, sometimes."
keto,"Those macros seem high. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9, male and at 199 pounds and macros call for less calories than that."
keto,How do you eat sourdough bread? Plain? Asking for a friend. :)
keto,"My tinnitus started way before Keto.  I didn't have exposure to concerts or machinery, it just was there.  Something I noticed one day and has never left.  I don't know what brought it on, if anything.  My tinnitus sounds like 1000 grasshoppers in the night."
keto,"I don't use words like 'bad', 'cheat' or 'behave'.  It's just food.  It has occupied too much of my brain power for too long.  It's not about some value judgment of my personal character.  It was important to me to relegate food to it's proper place....it is fuel-that's it.  I find alcohol has a much more severe reaction on me after being keto this long.  2 drinks and I'm done.  I don't have any kind of problem with alcohol.  I have a drink or 2 once in a week or 10 days.  it's consumption is counterproductive to weight loss.  Fat burning stops while your liver deals with the alcohol for as long as 24 hours so drinking every day would not be a good practice in my mind."
keto,"I'm trying to guess the origins of this.  Probably Facebook misinformation generated by carb based food sources. 

Keto = Man = Meat ? 

SAD = Woman = Sugar ? 

A bit of a stereotype."
keto,"For me there's no set amount, especially when all labels here show nutritional information per 100g (and I suspect that's the case for you too due to your example). My intended portion size needs to be accounted for as well.

Take something like a hot sauce for instance, where I might only use a few drops on top of a meal. The carb count per 100g might be sky high, but I'm not going to actually use 100 grams, maybe something more like 1 or 2 grams. At that point it might as well be 100 grams carbs and I can still fit it into my macros for the day without a problem. 

Marinated meats can end up on the other end of the spectrum. Some can have something like 4 or 5 g carbs per 100g, which doesn't sound like that much at first glance, but since I tend to eat easily 300g of it we're suddenly talking up to 15g for that alone. That's gonna be a no for me."
keto,"Here is something my friend, who was a Navy SEAL, told me:

‚ÄúMotivation is great, it makes the work easier, but there will come a time when it fails you. Discipline is your friend. It will not fail you. It will get you through the slumps.‚Äù

My takeaway was I used my early motivation to develop discipline then I was set. It‚Äôs a gift to yourself and you‚Äôre worth it.

I‚Äôve been doing Keto OMAD for about 2.5 years and I can honestly say once you get your body in a rhythm, the craving for sweets (sugar) pretty much goes away. And when it does creep up, your mind kicks in and tells you you don‚Äôt want to throwaway all of your hard work.

These are just random thoughts and accounts from my own journey. Hopefully there is at least a little piece in here that is helpful. Good luck, we‚Äôre all rooting for you!"
keto,Dumb as all hell. Never knew diets could be sexest.
keto,We got this!
keto,That‚Äôs a pretty weak assumption to have.
keto,"Yeah intend to go for things that have some more fat.
As for 2 or less. I've found out that even many veggies that are adviced have over that. Like broccoli."
keto,I followed Dr Westmans plan to lose the weight.  I'm now looking at the findings of Dr Jason Fung in the 'Obesity Code' regarding fasting and metabolic disorder.  It's nice to work with experienced people who see it for what it is instead of all the blame the medical community has placed on fat people.  There is still much that is theory and unstudied science but I find being my own science experiment very rewarding.
keto,"I‚Äôve never found a recipe for traditional pizza crust that i felt was low enough carb for me. I could fit them in if I only have one meal per day. I‚Äôve always been an over eater and I don‚Äôt like to let myself get hungry as that tends to bring on cravings for me. 

I love pizza and while some don‚Äôt like it I make a crust out of canned chicken like tuna bound together with an egg and a couple ounces of parmasean cheese. It sounds gross but the way you dry the chicken out it tastes like a crispy thin crust pizza. I prefer turkey pepperoni and always have so woth a full can of chicken for the crust, turkey pepperoni, 1/4 cup of raos pizza sauce and half cup mozzarella there is something like two carbs for the entire 10 inch pizza. I want to say it‚Äôs around 600 cals. Sometimes it f my macros are tight I ditch the sauce. It hits that pizza craving perfectly. 

https://www.ketoconnect.net/no-carb-pizza/"
keto,Awesome! Thanks a bunch. I really appreciate it!
keto,I just saw a recipe for a keto chocolate pudding made of boiled eggs... so why not?
keto,4 usually but like around 2 or less preferably. But check protein and fat is important too. Need to keep a balance between then with a slight edge to fat
keto,"Yep, it really is that simple.

I'd recommend going [here](https://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/) and calculating your macros and then tracking your intake with Cronometer.

When you use the calculator manually override carbs to 20g, choose sedentary activity level, closer to the high end of the protein recommendation, and a 20% deficit. Unless you have had a dexa scan use the suggestion for body fat %... smart scales aren't accurate for that."
keto,"I think that is true. Women tend to like carbs more than meat. 

That isn't to say that women shouldn't do Keto, I just think mean LOVE the food that comes with Keto."
keto,It's just a craving-a passing feeling to ignore.  What is I had a 'craving' (desire) for my sisters husband?  I'm an adult with a choice to make.
keto,Thanks.  I do recalculate every 10.  I will try to let it go :-)
keto,"Nope. I‚Äôm a female 3-year keto veteran and saying this is a ‚Äúman‚Äôs diet‚Äù is the dumbest shit I‚Äôve ever heard. üòÇ

Congrats on your progress though! Feeling great is something we should never take for granted. :)"
keto,I had the same problem with omad. I was ravenous and tended to over eat. I never do omad now I don‚Äôt like how it feels but typically do 16:8 most days not the week due to not being hungry at breakfast time.
keto,How did you break the addiction? Did you simply focus on the diet? ‚ÄúSimply‚Äù being an oxymoron.
keto,"Oh fuck you! Dont ever disrespect pizza crust like that ever again! JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE CANT MAKE GOOD FUCKING DOUGH!

leave that dough covered in yo fridge for a week and youll have great tasting dough, similar to sourdough."

Congratulations!!"

keto,That's a great idea to use them up.  I never thought of that.  I'm thinking it would add a pretty eggy flavour.
keto,I waited to be fat adapted before I did any fasting.  I was OMAD by week 4.  I just waited til I lost my appetite.  If you've been keto 9 months what do you mean by 'kick start'?
keto,"All I can suggest is to recalculate your macros every time you lose 10 pounds.  I didn't weigh in weekly like that because as you have discovered, the inevitable gains are discouraging.  The scale is not a good tool for keto.  I weighed in on day one and then once every 3rd month at my regular appointment.  I didn't even own a a scale.  I know I can go up and down 5 pounds in a day.  It's just fluid retention and not fat."
keto,"You look great my man! Nice work. What exactly do you mean by ""7 months restricted keto and 3 months with carbs""?"
keto,"There is some magic with routine fasting.  Your insulin drops quite a bit, correcting insulin resistance and getting your body to consume body fat for energy, reducing cravings."
keto,"Yup, and it‚Äôs not just the UK. It‚Äôs pretty much everywhere in the world except the US and Canada."
keto,"Thanks!  I've had this before too, a couple of times, but the lowest loss I've had in a week is about 0.8 pounds.  I've had a couple of 3.5-5 pound wooshes.  Fingers crossed another is coming!"
keto,I am definately suggesting that it's dangerous.  It's called alcholic ketoacidosis (AKA).  It usually presents in alcholics who haven't eaten in a few days (they're in ketosis).
keto,"if you're weighing all your food etc, then just keep going at it. you'll probably get the WOOSH effect of when you're stalled but doing everything right. 

I've had it happen, id be stuck then BAM ill lose like 4-5lbs after a stall all of a sudden"
keto,I was so fat my doctor told me to just start walking for exercise.  I did it for a year.  He started me at 5 minutes a day for the first week then 10 minutes and so on until I reached an hour.  He told me it would be hard on my heart to do anything strenuous.  I'm 2 years keto now.  I walk for an hour every other day and do pi-yo and yoga for stretching alternately.  I'm down 130+ pounds but for the first year did nothing but walk.
keto,"Thanks for the explanation. That's what I was thinking in regards to whether the food I'm eating is ""clean"" per se. So basically, if I concentrate on my carb intake (&lt;20g), limit my caloric intake (&lt; resting metabolic rate), and make sure my electrolyte levels remain stable, the rest should come with time? Is that a solid way to look at it from an experienced ketoer (Not sure if that is a word lol) standpoint ?"
keto,"How's your sodium? Are you hitting 5000mg a day?

keto,"I have found very few worth buying. That's why I make most of them. I've always cooked and baked, so it was easy for me to figure out what would work for the tastes to be spot on. Texture is another big thing for me. I did have some trial and error, but now I'm all set."
keto,"I think the lowest I've seen is 4g net and they're expensive too! 

Thanks for the info! I'll have to give it a try!"
keto,You would likely benefit from reading 'The Obesity Code' by Dr Jason Fung.  He explains why we regain.  YOu're right that it has to be a life style change-a permanent one.  We all know what happens when you go back to the dark side of processed food like substance consumption.  I had to deal with the eating disorder first.
keto,"Yes, I do all of this!"
keto,"No problem!

Ketosis is caused simply by carb restriction, causing your body to use fat for energy. You could eat nothing but low carb protein bars, keto friendly ice cream and fast food hamburgers with no buns/ketchup and remain in ketosis as long as you keep your carbs low enough; even if you are at a caloric surplus. Ketosis doesn't care how ""clean' your food choices are, only that you sufficiently restrict carbs.

20 pounds of weight loss in under 2 months is a great start."
keto,I just leave the tortilla out! I might be way off base but most of them that I've seen still have 3+ carbs per tortilla which doesn't fit my macros very well unless I'm doing OMAD that day. But it tastes great without!
keto,"If you do start to exercise, take it slow with some incline walking and light strength training. Make sure to replenish electrolytes and trust your body when it tells you to take a break."
keto,"you weighing your foods? also you should always weigh yourself in the mornings when you wake up and after using the restroom.

Always weigh on the same scale in the same spot and try to weigh yourself during the same part of the day as you did previously. you gotta remember you're human you will retain some water,have food digesting in your tummy still etc."
keto,"Thank you, you're  right at least keto baked goods wouldn't  lead to a binge because  they're  not that good"
keto,First of all congrats on being able to lose that 100lbs..that is a huge accomplishment..so now you have  know you fallen off and recognize its time to continue back on..just remember what it felt to lose those noticeable pounds from before and that happy feeling is where you want to get and tell yourself- 100lbs lose was good but lets focus on good eating and see where it takes me. I know people focus on the weight and lose it there - what you want to focus is good eating and let the weight drop over its time without trying to worry you only dropped a pound here or maybe went up a pound..get the right food and it will come off over tims
keto,"4 weeks into keto and 16/8. I‚Äôve had less than 40 carbs per day for the past 2 weeks and am taking electrolyte capsules to fulfill potassium, calcium, and mineral/vitamin requirements. 

I‚Äôm at a major caloric deficit when I include my calories burned from a 5-6 day exercise routine. 

I assumed I would be in ketosis at this point as this is my 3rd time doing keto IF in two years. 

I feel super weak, hungry, leg cramps and major loss of strength. Maybe I‚Äôm not eating enough?"
keto,"Thank you so much. I want keto to work again, I also have done CICO at the beginning  of my journey and lost 30lbs. That was my huge motivation  and what got me started on the research train of keto. Last time I did keto I truly  enjoyed the positive  feeling  it gave me to eat food I like and still loose weight"
keto,I don‚Äôt have any answers for you but I will say last night my family was eating garlic bread and the smell was so heavenly I had to bury my face in a pillow while I tried to not throw a massive hissy fit.
keto,"Thank you so much for the reply! That makes all the sense in the world. I'm very new to all of this so, it would make sense that I am shooting myself in the foot. I guess I thought that using the MCT oil would help to guarantee that I would stay in a state of ketosis. Correct me if I am wrong here. If I keep my carb intake to 20g per day or below, eat clean whole food (literally zero food out of a box and no sugar) and keep my caloric intake below my resting metabolic rate, my body should stay in a state of ketosis anyway, correct? I have to admit I am becoming a bit frustrated. I eat extremely clean, low carb, low calorie whole food. I restrict my caloric intake, I do a 20- 24 hour fast twice a week and don't seem to be getting the benefits that some other folks seem to achieve. I've lost about 20 pounds and now my ears are ringing like I've been in a war lol. I think I may need to go back to the basics of this diet. I must have missed something fundamental."
keto,"I lost 100 lbs on keto too, i went from 250lbs to 146 and then i went back to eating a more balanced diet due to me not wanting to feel guilty on eating over 20 net cards of veggies tbh.

Now i calorie count and am not scared of carbs from Fruits and Veggies, i sometimes eat bread. I just use the discipline keto gave me

Keto has made me love keto food so like ill make some sick almond flour pancakes and then unlike when i was on keto i can now blend it up with a banana. 

I've maintained my weight i gained like 7lbs back of water weight (which i expected) and now I've lost those same 7 pounds by just eating at a deficit. So if i went back on keto and lost the water weight again id prob lose like 6-7lbs within the week.

I adore keto but i just don't wanna limit my veggies so much, like brussel sprouts even add up a lot of net carbs.

Although im not keto anymore i love this sub because for 9 months it was my life and i just love keto and have helped my friends irl with it. I love going on keto hauls with my friends who are doing keto its really fun"
keto,"Thank you. I would never say I am a food purist! I also have never enjoyed the ""fake"" taste of keto treats"
keto,"I bought 1 of each box, cinnamon/chocolate/peanut butter.  This is the only cereal I've tried so far.  Its great, I'm very satisfied with it.  I measure out the 40g service and add 1 cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk to it.  I will certainly be buying more of this."
keto,That‚Äôs a great idea.   Cauliflower browns so nicely in the oven that I bet this is just killer!
keto,Jalepeno poppers are definitely  a favorite! I have not been blessed with losing the urge for carby junk.
keto,"Hey everyone,

Starting up keto this week and had a general question about the amount of carbs I'm allowed to have.  In the research I've been doing online, I've seen some posts talk about ""net carbs"" while others talk about just regular carbs.  Some articles say it's okay to have up to 50 grams of carbs as long as the net carbs are around 25 grams while other articles say I should try to stay around 25 grams of regular carbs and make no mention to net carbs. Just looking for some quick clarification, thanks!"
keto,It's only 3g net carbs.  Keto-ers that weight and track everything are who eats just 1 cup.
keto,Steak day üòâ
keto,"I found that when I started keto, trying all the fun recipes and experimenting is what motivated me to stick to it in the beginning. As I figured out a rhythm, I found that keeping things simple and meal prepping for the week is what I needed and I could make keto desserts and snacks when I really felt like I needed them. 

I watched my friends recently share a cheesecake and it made me sad, so I bought stuff to make a lemon cheesecake mousse, but it's been over a month since I last made a keto dessert for myself."
keto,The pandemic did a number on me. Went from 233-135 and maintained for two years. I spent some of the pandemic binge eating back on sugar and crawled up to 178. Currently sitting at 170. I feel great because I‚Äôm back in keto but I‚Äôm finding it harder to cut calories this time around for weight loss. Any tips from your recent drop?
keto,"If you‚Äôre on a keto diet, macadamia milk has more fat than almond milk.  It tastes better and has a better texture than almond milk, too.  Nice and creamy."
keto,But they do the Macarena all day.
keto,"A few recipes I use with protein powder:

* [Protein Powder mini-cakes](https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplentyketo/comments/74k187/low_carb_microwaved_minicakes/)
* [Protein Powder ""Mug"" Bread](https://imgur.com/a/Zy7vz)

The first two are based on the Keto Connect ""nutritious mug cake"" recipe here:

[Egg loaf](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/90r29m/egg_loaf_troubleshooting/e2stnyh/) (tastes like French toast), [microwaved omelets](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/6p4i28/jimmy_dean_simple_scrambles/dko9pfh/), and [microwaved cream cheese pancakes (""custard in a bowl"")](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/6tps7g/request_favorite_keto_desserts/dlmm38m).

If you grind up the meat finely enough, you could do chicken salad, ham/SPAM salad, or tuna salad, or even [a bowl of chili](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7dq1y3/ketoground_beef_chicken_dinner_ideas/dq0mg71). I just use my Magic Bullet.

If you want something sweet, [Quickie no-bake ""cheesecake""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/6tps7g/request_favorite_keto_desserts/dlmllk3), or there's always Halo Top, Enlightened, or Breyer's Carb Smart ice creams.

These [Light and Fluffy Pancakes](https://imgur.com/a/qvQo0FL) might work, but you may want to ""mash"" them up with the syrup.

Lemon curd is easy to make in the microwave -- 3 eggs + 1 cup lemon juice + 1 cup (powdered) erythritol + 1/2 cup butter, whisking every 30 to 60 seconds until it thickens. I've tried it without the butter, to get rid of most of the calories, and that tasted great too."
keto,"You don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true but I‚Äôm letting you know that it‚Äôs true. Ma√≠z (corn) was domesticated 6-10,000 years ago in Mexico. They didn‚Äôt live until 90 because of diseases, violence and no antibiotics or other medicinal science just like in the rest of the ancient world, not because of obesity, heart disease and diabetes. 

Even in modern times, before American products were widely available in Mexico, there were very few obese people. My dad grew up eating corn tortillas and beans every meal, every day and meat only once in a blue moon. He was skinny and so were all of his siblings, relatives and the entire village where he grew up. 

So tell me again how bad carbs are. 

I know perfectly well you can‚Äôt compare eating corn tortillas and beans with stuffing your face with wonderbread and French fries every day. Not all carbs are created equal. But you literally said all carbs are bad and they‚Äôre not."
keto,"https://practicaldiabetic.com/2019/07/13/what-is-ketosis-and-diabetic-ketoacidosis

The ""tl;dr"" from the article:

&gt; Ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) are not the same thing. While ketosis is triggered through an extended lack of dietary carbohydrate, **DKA is triggered by the exhaustion of insulin in the blood**; the consequence of which is the liver over-producing fuel for the body, including ketones which, when they accumulate, can turn the blood acidic and lead to death."
keto,"Hi, would like to ask for alternative(s) to avocado, thanks."
keto,"Sounds like a sodium/potassium issue IME. 

Check the faq for amounts"
keto,You look great...but do you miss your chubby cheeks :)
keto,"Medically, obese is not a personal opinion. Super impressive progress, OP!"
keto,How would you compare them to a tortilla? I don't know what to expect going into this lol
keto,"Do it again!

Gained the weight back that you worked hard to lose and feel sorry for yourself?

Who cares!

Do it again!

Constantly thinking about where you would be if you hadn‚Äôt fallen off the wagon?

Who cares!

Do it again!!

Forgive your past self. Forward momentum. What choices can you make now to help future you!?

Forgive yourself, let go of it, and think and move forward.

Do it again!"
keto,"Almond, vanilla flavored, is pretty good."
keto,Daaaaaaaamn!  Nice work!
keto,Was too big too but made a lot of adjustments and really changed my life I can help you if you want to loss fat fast have mastered the technique
keto,"Thank you ... a message much appreciated I am on that edge snd hoping tomorrow is a promise kept
As I lost now 10 lbs away from 100 lbs lost with another 75lbs to messing around with my carbs high calories high and feeling like I am Out of Control."
keto,"I get the BodPod done every 60 days and I have one of those scales but it's very high end. After 6 months doing the BodPod, I no longer use the scale for anything but body weight. It's literally like looking at a magic 8 ball otherwise."
keto,"I'm not scrolling through the comments because I know what's already in there based on this sub, but try eating nothing but actual meat, dark green veggies, eggs, water, plain tea/coffee, very low carb nuts and olive oil for a couple of weeks and let nature do it's thing."
keto,That sounds like it could be dehydration or too low blood sugar.  You may not be eating enough for working out.
keto,"I eat no more than 20 grams of net carbs a day.  For me, those net carbs can come from pretty much anything."
keto,Thank you. I just see a lot of ‚Äúnet carbs‚Äù on products trying to convince me that they are keto
keto,WOW great! I'm so happy for you. That all sounds amazing. Reading posts like yours pushes me to keep going. You're right. I'll just let the evidence speak for itself.
keto,"Ah, nice. A simple, succinct phrase. Gotta remember that one."
keto,"Very well said. Thanks for the comment. Yeah, it's frustrating being human - being simultaneously aware of how fucking dumb and impulsive we are, and yet totally at the mercy of such impulses."
keto,"&gt; it was like pulling teeth to stay on my diet

That's where I was. Spent a few months on maintenance before just letting go of keto. I then undid 6 months of progress in a span of 4-6 weeks."
keto,Wow!!! Congratulations. I'm so proud of all your success
keto,"Hmmm I don't know, we eat multiple times a day (unless you're doing IF), every day, every year of our lives. Add all that up, and that's a pretty significant chunk of your life. If eating isn't a part of who you are, I genuinely cannot fathom what is. Eating is cultural. It's spiritual. It's fun and social. It's sustenance. It's everything. I don't blame the people who evangelize their diets - eating takes up a very significant amount of our time as biological organisms. Society forms traditions around food. We've developed culinary arts. It's a celebrated concept. In some ways, yeah, I can see it being really insulting if someone walked up to me and insulting my eating habits."
keto,"""They can eat my entire ass"" is the single greatest thing I've ever heard and I'm fucking using that all the time from now on. I'll pay you royalties. Thanks for the advice haha."
keto,Amazing. Sexy. Gorgeous!
keto,"I started keto to lose a small amount of weight, since I do better with how much I eat if I am following a diet with strict rules (It was the same when I spent a year on the vegan diet), but I also decided to try this one after looking into the various other health effects. I'm staying on it not to maintain my weight, but because of the positive changes I've noticed to the symptoms of my mental illnesses."
keto,"Well said, haha. I'll do so!"
keto,"Yeah the political side of all of this is the most mind-blowing to me. I once read a quote, idk by who, it was something like ""I don't do politics is bullshit. Everything is political. Everything. Whether your boss decides to give you a raise or fire you, is political."" etc. it went something like that. I just didn't realize everything meant... food.. too... Damn."
keto,Good point! Conclusion: don't listen to unsolicited advice.
keto,"No.  
1 gram of fiber is +1 carb.   
Then, you can subtract it -1 carb. 
         
+1 and -1 equals zero. 
           
Frankly, if we could do what you suggested, we would be making pizza with flax seed crusts and staying in ketosis."
keto,"Yeah, as far as I can tell from my research so far, this concept is still new enough - we're the new frontier. We sound and look crazy. Some day it'll be common sense."
keto,"I really, really want to be like that some day. I want to be able to just off-hand spit out some knowledge about studies and research done on this topic, results, etc. That's so powerful. Right now I've had a lot of exposure to that stuff - none of it committed to memory yet. I just understand the general gist of how the body works, how carb affects it, how hormones respond to each-other, how insulin is the culprit behind all of this, etc. Cool - good for you!"
keto,"Wow! As long as your happy, man. You're doing what you can to be healthy, so at least that's something. In a way we're all friends here."
keto,"Yeah it's just so obvious to me at this point. All I need to remember and think about is how our current civilization is just a tiny, tiny sliver of the history of modern humans, and how for a majority of our human existence we simple didn't have agriculture, carbs, processed sugars ,etc. And we did \*just fine\*. The human race would be extinct if carbs were as necessary as naysayers claimed."
keto,"LOL I love the hyperbole route. I love calling sugar poison, because it just hits so hard. \*\*I don't normally do this though, this isn't what causes the hostile responses I get\*\*. But using hyperbole like that sort of triggers the same mind-blowing response I had when I first dove into this and got exposed to ideas like ""carbs are harmful"", ""this is how insulin works"", ""this is why insulin sensitivity happens"". Mind blown."
keto,"Yeah every now and then it pops up. Especially since I'm still new to this, doing a ton of research every day - every now and then I just run into such hostile content. What's interesting is that the people / sources who respond to keto with the most hostility also tend to have the least evidence to back up their negative claims. ;)"
keto,"Power to you! Even though I'm young, aware of how the internet works, and jaded af, I still sometimes succumb to random, stupid people on the internet who trigger the crap out of me. The human brain is so... frustrating."
keto,"That's awesome! Yeah I think the empiricism (doing blood work, measuring, self-monitoring, etc.) is sort of what separates a ""fad"" from a legitimate life-style/practice. I don't consider things that are backed by hard evidence and science as ""fads"". It's just such a delegitimizing word...   


But yeah I like your take on the idea that diets/fasts/etc. are not for everyone."
keto,"Sustainable is the key. I love this lifestyle, and it doesn‚Äôt feel like a ‚Äúdiet‚Äù."
keto,"I personally have not tried it with casein but I heard it turns out well with it. For the butter pecan I would not add the cocoa powder, just use the protein powder with baking powder and almond milk.  for the icing you can mix half a scoop of the same protein powder with the yogurt to give it the same flavor as your cake and add a bit of almond milk to thin it out ."
keto,How many calories are you averaging a day? IF? Working out?
keto,"Completely. I need to put together a whole meal plan. I don‚Äôt feel too interested in food right now and this has caused me to be lazy in my diet. I‚Äôm eating what‚Äôs there and what‚Äôs easy, and I need to make better choices"
keto,"I‚Äôm crazy freezing after a workout, but am otherwise ok. A little cold all the time of late, but that just might be a drafty house and not a side effect."
keto,"Well done!
Congratulations!"
keto,What an amazing transformation. Great work!  Keep pushing forward and congratulations!
keto,I had mine redirected to a local homeless shelter. Don't want samoas in the house. I don't trust myself that much.
keto,"1. Get your body to switch to motabolizing fat. 
2. Listen to your body on when and how much to eat, you'll soon find out on how much satisfies you and how long you can fast. 
3.  Eat whole foods and always cook the food yourself, when it comes to flavorings, stick to salt and pepper only. 
Doing all of the above, you don't need to count carbs or calories. 
Trust you body and stay AS LOW CARB AS POSSIBLE. 
I've lost 25kg following this protocol, I believe you can do the same."
keto,"I'm going into it this time with that mindset. This isn't a diet. This is how I want to be able to eat for the rest of my life, just with maintenance calories later on. 

From my heaviest weight, I lost over 42% of my body weight. In just those 6 months, it was 36% lost. So I do worry that I might have altered my metabolism in a bad way. I used everything, from low carb, to intermittent fasting, to just plain 6 small meals a day and 700 calories a day as long as there was enough proteins and fats. I'd switch up whenever I felt uncomfortable, but from the minute I started drinking sugar sodas again and doing fast food, it crumbled.

I guess I'll see here soon if I've hurt my metabolism. I'm trying to figure out which kind of diet to start on or if I should just go with what I did before but set a more realistic goal weight."

keto,TYSM!
keto,"Cheers! Usually I have a snack around 12 and then dinner around 6.  


Initially I signed up to a gym for a year about 4 months ago and did some personal training sessions with a guy. Unfortunately he was very condescending and used, in my opinion, sales tactics and emotional manipulation. I constantly felt like I had to prove myself to him, which was a really toxic environment for me.

&amp;#x200B;

After showing the owner the texts, he said ""He's kind of old school, tough love is sort of his style"". That didn't really bode well for me, I felt like I was going to be his next trophy piece. So I told the PT guy exactly what was up, and didn't go back to the gym. Now I just periodically go in to weigh myself in with a yearly membership ticking in the background.

&amp;#x200B;

When I feel up to it, i'll go back, but I still don't, I don't want to ruin the good things I have going on at the moment."
keto,Thanks man!
keto,I‚Äôm in constant back pain. And my posture is getting bad. I‚Äôm too young to feel like. 35M. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 200. Goal is 150.
keto,My rules. Only allow one cheat day every 2 months. Weigh in at least every 2 days so you get the reality check of the scale. Don‚Äôt go more than 3 days without exercise.
keto,I started the same time around you and I am around the same height. I was 275 now I'm 215 in 6 months. Keto and intermittent fasting go hand in hand together. Keep up the good work!
keto,There‚Äôs a lot of evidence that losing weight as fast as you can on keto really sets yourself up to undo a lot of the progress if you switch to a less extreme diet after you hit your goal. Slow and steady wins the race.
keto,"This comment really struck a nerve with me, thank you.  Makes me look at the body I'm wanting to change with more love and appreciation, and less loathing and disgust."
keto,"Hi bro,

Cheer up, it‚Äôs cny, don‚Äôt be hard on yourself. Have you considered getting a microwave? I‚Äôm not sure if u have enough space for that (depending on your room config and roommate) so if it‚Äôs too difficult, easiest way u could do is by dirty keto, just minus off the rice during ordering mixed rice or so and pick your veggies and meats. If weight is priority, you could try adapting to omad or mixing in prolong fasting to maximize the effects. It‚Äôs really difficult to adapt, I too struggle long period over college and university due to lack of kitchens and hardware. My solution? Upon graduation get your own place or rent one with a kitchen where u can cook.

Hope that helps, 0.02
Each of us have the battles to make, just be strategic about it man.

Cheers"

keto,Congrats on the hard work! Keep going and know you're not alone! We`re all routing for you and everyone else who has made the keto lifestyle change! Congrats again!
keto,"I'm operating on a 35% deficit instead of the normal 20%. I lost 22lbs the first month and I'm at about 11 more pounds the second month (so far). I recalculated my macros after the 1st 20 lbs. I track every calorie and gram.

It's far easier for a 350lb person to lose 20lbs quickly than a 150lb person. I used to sometimes eat 4000+ calories in a single meal. Now I eat less than 1600 calories per day. When I get to my target weight, I'll adjust up to about 1800 per day for maintenance."
keto,"Right! We might be trying to get down thinner than we should be. I was looking at my progress pics the other day and my arm. My God my arm. I looked anorexic. So maybe a healthier goal weight might be better this time. I know some of it depends on frame size. So the BMI might say XXX is healthy weight when in reality, if you go back and look at progress pics you can see some famishness in there lol In my generation, very small was attractive, but I guess things have changed over time and it's okay to be actual normal weight and not the thinnest you can be without dying. And you're on the taller side, and that really does help. I bet you probably would be too thin at 135. So you're really close to a goal already, just keep at it or start back when you're ready."
keto,You still need to count them or weigh them. Every little bit counts.
keto,Yea your basically right! You get to a point pretty quickly where food just isn‚Äôt that important anymore and you have to remind yourself to eat lol well that was my experience at least.
keto,"Fair warning, it  becomes harder as you get leaner. You will need to exercise more if you don't already."
keto,Thank you! I‚Äôve been working out a lot and I know I‚Äôve put on muscle. I got way too skinny to be honest. I look healthy around 145.
keto,"Well done dude! What‚Äôs your schedule, eating pattern like? And any exorcise incorporated?"
keto,"She already did. 49 F, 5‚Äô6, and she's currently 195 lbs. With that said, she needs to recalibrate her macros since she started at 205 lbs 6 weeks ago.

In either case, 1.7 lbs of weight loss on average per week is really not bad."
keto,"You're already at a great starting point and could be normal weight in no time flat. I know it's discouraging to gain back like that, but you're a lot taller and have room to spare here. You're in a good position whenever you're ready to start back."
keto,What do you take?
keto,"Konsyl my friend.... konsyl
Safe, natural and tsp daily.
Unflavored konsyl.... you will NOT be sorry

keto,"I was 135. I am 165 now. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7, female."
keto,"I try to be encouraged by it. I mean what I took off in 6 months, it took me 12 months to gain back. But the trick this time will be how in the heck do I get to that point next time - that point where you feel like you're owed a year's worth of food in two months - and not snap. 

Could you tell if there was a certain weight where you started struggling? For me it was 120. I could kind of tell that's where my body would have been comfortable. And I was trying to take it 20 pounds past that. So it could just be an issue of having to accept 120 or where I'm at now. And at almost 160, 120 sounds fantastic."
keto,You‚Äôre right. I got down to my goal weight and then slipped and gained 30 pounds over 12 months. I weigh more than when I started keto in 2017.
keto,"Count your calories. And macros. (Fats proteins carbs)
Try IF
And by the way I have been on the diet for a total of 7 weeks , my entire life 

And just got the courage to complete a 3 day fast

It was amazing to see what my body was capable of. Spent 95% of that time not hungry, took in water, electrolytes and salt. 

Just a confirmation that it really all works 


Good luck!"
keto,"I was even happy with Crepini‚Äôs egg wrap. I just tried them and for all you Florida people, they are BOGO at Publix this week until Wednesday I believe.

keto,Same. Wah!
keto,Start counting your calorie intake if you want results. Trust me it works!
keto,"Yo, Same! Everything except the China bit. How do we break through and get back to the routine backed by will power? I used to be so consistent but now I can‚Äôt pass up a snack at a gas station when I have to stop for gas. I was never like this in my life!"
keto,Just tell the haters to eff off.  If they think keto is bad for you then they haven‚Äôt done any actual research.  You don‚Äôt need carbs.  Your body has 2 processes that will provide glucose without you having to consume carbs.  Gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.
keto,I agree!  Where do we track our weight and measurements on the new version?  I cant find it

keto,"I think they're addicted to carbs, and addicts do weird stuff ü§∑

weird stuff like acting overreactive and argumentative when their brain's subconscious strategy for justifying the addiction is up for scrutiny.

keto,I don‚Äôt know if it would help but recently I took two days off from keto and went right back to my routine after and the weight has been melting off like when I first started. Sometimes taking a break helps because your body becomes accustom to the diet. When I was doing CICO strictly I‚Äôd eat at maintenance when I hit a plateau for a few days same basic principle with taking a break from keto.

keto,I want to try those too.
keto,Glad to hear you got it sorted! KCKO!
keto,"So question.... I am new to keto but not new to the ‚Äúdiet‚Äù world. I have found s this to be the easiest (so far) to adapt to. I know there are some challenges, as most of us have been taught that ‚Äúfat is bad‚Äù. But I think the bigger picture is that we need to sit and think about WHY we are all doing this diet.. ie.. to lose weight, gain health benefits or both. So with that being said, why do some want or ‚Äúneed‚Äù to find replacements foe all the bad food that made us unhealthy and overweight? Doesn‚Äôt it seem ironic that we try to find subs for cake, chips, cookies, pancakes.. etc..? If we are wanting to be healthy, changing our mindset is just as important. I‚Äôm not saying this is an easy task to do, as some of us have been eating ‚Äújunk food‚Äù for many years, myself included. But I feel that if I truly want to be healthy and at my goal weight and keep it there, we shouldn‚Äôt be thinking junk food substitutes. Any thoughts from you all. Please don‚Äôt take this as a criticism or that I feel l have it figured out, because I certainly don‚Äôt. I am just curious how you all feel about this mindset. Thank you!"

keto,"Yeah, Bang has 0 carbs, I've checked the label on it. I've since transitioned to 20:4 IF and having the drinks at start of feeding window seemed to do the trick."
keto,"Energy drinks are no joke, I remember years ago drinking 2 of those Monster No Sugar (or maybe it was Low Carb?) drinks every day.  GI issues, and then heart palpitations.  

**Be careful.**  Also check the labels, I just checked the website, looks like they range from 3-9 net carbs per can for the theoretical ""keto friendly"" versions."
keto,"Okay so my lab is in a consortium with some of the top cardiac metabolism research labs in the world at UPenn. The PIs within this group still do not fully understand the roles of ketones in the failing heart, more specifically they don't know if ketones are there to help the heart function better in response to the pathology or if the increased ketones is a maladaptive phenotype. To me, it makes more sense that the ketones are there to support energy production. We know that ketone transport into tissues is essentially unregulated, so the higher circulating concentrations are, the more the tissues take them up. The heart's favorite energy substrate is free fatty acids, and ketones are closely related in that both result in the production of acetyl-coa to enter the TCA cycle, but the ketone breakdown pathway is less entailed and more economical than that of fatty acid beta oxidation (Beta oxidation: 4 enzymatic steps to yield 1 acetyl-coa; ketolysis: 3 enzymatic steps to generate 3 acetyl-coa). 

I think, in general, fasting is great for overall metabolic health and is therefore great for the heart. The problem is that fasting is a vague term. There's intermittent fasting (which I generally recommend to people looking to improve their metabolic health), water fasting, dry fasting, and then these forms of fasting can all occurs for various amounts of time. I think at the very minimum, virtually no one should be eating for more than 12hrs per day. The research shows that metabolic health greatly improves if feeding is restricted to a 12hr window, and incrementally improves as you decrease that window. I personally do either 16:8 or 18:6 (fasting:feeding) basically every day.

Regarding kidney stones and keto, the cause of the stones isn't the diet itself. It's the shift in electrolyte balance that occurs in response to the diet. The way to mitigate this is to make sure both salt (not table salt...like Celtic sea salt or some other salt high in trace minerals) and water consumption is sufficiently high. Also, making sure magnesium status is maintained. Most Americans are deficient, which is frightening because the cells of your body can literally not make ATP (energy) without magnesium.

Sorry for the long winded answer. The heart-ketones discussion is still a very hot topic so I didn't want to rush through it too much."
keto,Bagels
keto,You still need to restrict calories on Keto.
keto,"Thanks for sharing, great work and keep it up!"
keto,I crave the diet soda everyday tho.
keto,No. Your studies are flawed and heap together unhealthy food with healthy food. Fiber is useless unless you are consuming plant matter that needs to  ferment in your gut.Whole food animal based diets work for everyone that I know on them long time.
keto,"Agreed, and the restriction depends on your goals. Lots of folks can stay in ketosis on 50g carbs, but at that point, their might not be calorie restrictions if you're functioning within low carb macros. 

If someone's trying to lose weight, there is restricting anyhow. Personally, I'd rather give up the carbs I can't process well anyways.

I've also found some good keto substitutes for bready things and eat foods like konjac noodles if I'm wanting some food volume to satisfy a binge craving while not actually cheating. 

I'd restrict in other ways on any other type of CICO, why not get in my bacon and cheeses while doing it? Lol, no regrets."
keto,No That's what I'm using. Hmmm. My jar said 3?
keto,I‚Äôm experimenting with CoolAid packets since you add your own sweetener.
keto,source?
keto,"I really agree with you. Keto is restrictive and is damn hard sometimes. But it works for me and I feel great on it. I just think people are doing others a disservice when they say how easy it is, especially when the shine hasn‚Äôt worn off yet. Then when those people find it not easy they wonder what‚Äôs wrong. It‚Äôs ok for things to be hard. Keto has many enjoyable aspects as well. Both things can be true."
keto,"Sometimes. Generally with fatty meats I sweat more for some reason, I just get warmer in general. Funnily enough, during spring and summer I actively dislike eating beef, and always have. I am all about chicken and fish. Fall and winter I seldom eat chicken, I am all about beef, game meat and fish. So I keep that in mind when canning meat. We can most of our own meat and veggies, I like to know what is in my food and it cuts costs to keep a long term pantry. 

A friend gave us a pile of home made venison Jerky today and I am a happy camper lol.

Low carb yum is really good, never had a recipe from there fail on me. Good stuff. The pizza crust I use is the one with the almond flour and parmesan cheese. I double it to get a big pizza."
keto,"Never trust a fart on keto.

Can we make that the second tagline after KCKO?"
keto,"Oh, I don't eat miracle whip, it tastes terrible even before I switched to keto."
keto,Two years on keto!  I indulge on bacon and butter but I have a large salad everyday. It works great if you‚Äôre willing to put some thought into it
keto,"Just make sure you're making them with real mayo.  I suggest making your own may. if you haven't done so before, it's super easy in a blender and you will thank yourself later. Homemade is a game changer compared to store bought.

Just don't use Miracle Whip or similar. Added sugar in that stuff."
keto,sorry about your mom :( sounds like you had good motivation to pay attention to health.
keto,Thank youuu!
keto,YES! I made a roast chicken last night and absolutely LOVED the dark meat and the skin! Both parts I wasn't really into before keto.
keto,"We are a big lab--lots of post-docs! Yep indeed, Josh is super quantitatively-minded, it's such an awesome perspective to have in our field. Really allows him to ask questions that no one else is asking and to make some major contributions. 

We are really the only lab that uses isotope tracing almost exclusively (it's super expensive lol). But we do have plenty of collaborators working on related topics! Are you interested in basic research around diet and metabolism or a more translational approach (perhaps working in the context of some disease models)?"
keto,"I checked out your lab, pretty impressive. Your PI started in biophysics and math? That's wild...

It's a big lab, and I think Princeton might be a bit out of my league. Do you know of more labs in your field, maybe through collaborations or networking at conferences? I don't really know any of the big names in that field...

And congrats on the fellowship! Harvard... You must be an animal haha that's incredible!"
keto,If you are overdoing it on keto sweetners it will happen. If you are drinking lots of diet soda it will happen too. Buy some charcoal underwear or cut back :)
keto,Oh for sure.
keto,Do you brew your own teas or are they prepackaged?
keto,"Yeah. The Kirkland natural PB is decent in carbs but it still adds up.  I also use the PBFit powder in things to scratch the itch.

But still for me to get the quantities I want, I usually have to adjust for a carb-light remainder of the day to be safe.  It's one of those things I can either have none, or more than 2 tbsp."
keto,"Yellow bell peppers.     
Stuffed with a meat and cheese and then grilled."
keto,Per teaspoon of bullion powder or paste? Seems unnecessary but not really a big issue since that's concentrate.  Now if it were 3g per tsp of completed broth.. that's a problem.
keto,"I just don't think 900 calories for my whole day is enough or healthy. Oh yes, deviled eggs, I love those thank you!"
keto,I think they‚Äôre like 3 net carbs for 7 ounces with enough fat to keep you satiated.
keto,Good point! I keep reading and all the apps seem to think that 2lbs a week is the maximum 'healthy' weight loss for the average person.
keto,"Unless you're hungry or short of your protein goal, just don't?

Otherwise, boiled eggs (or make them into devilled eggs) is a good option and most people usually have eggs on hand."
keto,"We have an organic peanut butter, Santa Cruz that i think we got at Costco, that is 2g for 2 tbsp. I have it for breakfast sometimes, just off the spoon."
keto,"2 days is not even enough for most people‚Äôs bodies to enter ketosis, so u got a point there"
keto,"What are the things you truly want? Can you not find a keto-friendly alternative?

I'm a big fan of potato chips, but now I'll grab some biltong, jerky or pork crackling instead.

There are plenty of sweet options for desserts, too.

Soft drinks can be zero-sugar - though there's some issues around aspartame, it's still better to stick to the diet than go ham on a regular bottle of Coke.

I honestly think it's about a change in perspective and eating smarter."
keto,"&gt; The high-fat keto diet is a known cause of acute pancreatitis because it causes an increase in circulating fats  

Yet most people on keto (even low carb) report very low number of serum triglycerides, usually in the range of 50-100 mg/dl."
keto,"Yes, definitely and fresh garlic. If we couldn't have tomatoes, my husband wouldn't last very long."
keto,"I don't have any currently, unfortunately but I will get some as soon as I can!"
keto,"This might be a weird question, but do you get meat sweats on keto?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't eat a ton of meet as it goes, but eating more of it makes me sweaty anyways lol

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Also, checked out Low Carb Yum. This is a goldmine!"
keto,"Is there a sort of ""snack"" o what to eat between meals?.. Ive been skipping breakfast for over a year (I wasn¬¥t aware of the intermittent fasting regime. I just did it out of convenience, no breakfast and whatever came to me during day and night)   Now I have started the keto diet , and I find it hard to comeup with meals with enough calories.  eating close to 900 cal every meal on keto it¬¥s somewhat hard.  I am VERY Ovweweight o the deficit calorie is also one of my goals, but I believe should keep my calories around 1800-2000    273 lbs, 5¬¥10 43yo    I was of course eating and drinking over 3000 calories a day, mostly in beer form...  well today will be my last beer for a long time"
keto,1 teaspoon is enough to make 2-3 cups of broth depending on how salty you like it. I like to mix a little with my homemade bone broth gel and add a bunch of water.
keto,Avacado.
keto,"I don't see value in cheat days so that's a non issue for me.

But I get your point. With most other diets, if you make a mistake or lose control you basically just lose that day's worth of progress. With keto, it's often 2 days to a week you lose and for some it can bring back cravings you thought you had kicked to the curb.   So in that sense, it's definitely less forgiving."
keto,Aren't peanuts considered a legume?
keto,"you can all go ahead and read my accidental separate post above. Look, im not saying keto is bad or doesn‚Äôt work. im saying ‚Äúits not healthy long term‚Äù. there are plenty of potential risks with high fat diets"
keto,"Cheese, fatty meats, nuts, peanut butter"
keto,"For me it's because I know, at least where I live it's hard to tell which restaurants aren't cooking their meats in carbs and sugars, which many do"
keto,"I watched a keto YouTube video where the guy recommended shell on pistachio nuts for this reason, seems solid."
keto,"Are you talking about the product Better Than Bouillon? The roasted chicken version has 1 gram of carbs per teaspoon. Same with the beef, I think. Both products list various sugars in the ingredients. But perhaps you're talking about a different product."
keto,"It's closer to fajita plus cheese.  Except it's grilled on skewers, not on a skillet."
keto,Cheese!
keto,"I cant do bread at all anymore, I'll be bloated and uncomfortable for a week. It's crazy, I was such a bread fiend and now I'm wondering if I have gluten sensitivity. I cant handle it at all"
keto,I read this post last week and had to try it.  Finally had some today.  Legit amazing OMAD find.  Minus the rice and beans of course!
keto,"I'm dreading this later in the year but for now, it's a non-issue.  I started at the right time to sidestep that issue via pandemic shutdowns."
keto,My guess would be from added starch and sugar. Just count the carbs if you wanna use it
keto,Sounds like eating contrast is coming up üòÄüòÄ
keto,When people post here asking for snack options my answer usually includes Rotisserie chicken üòÇ. Glad to hear it's clicking for you.
keto,Keto is muscle sparing so...
keto,"Differs from person to person for sure.  I thought I'd hate giving up carbs because boy I loved me some Cheez-its but now when my spouse is setting beside me eating them, I don't even feel tempted.

The smell of fresh bread, on the other hand...  I do miss fresh baked bread and there's no keto alternative that really satisfies that.

I think though that my biggest struggle with keto is restricting fresh fruit. I still  have some but I want more.

So yes, it restricts some things but it's not like people make it out to be where there are only 4 things you can eat in some combination."
keto,What are the ingredients? That will tell you what the carbs are
keto,Is Keto a safe diet for people over 60 who are otherwise healthy?
keto,"It's a restrictive diet. There's no need to beat around the bush about it. Not everyone is going to be content with horking down a whole fucking chicken and some avocado and string cheese, and that's fine."
keto,"No offense but the first part of this post comes off super preachy and out of touch tbh. This diet literally cuts out an entire macro and if you eat too much of that one macro it immediately throws you out of ketosis and you have to start the entering process all over again and deal with the cravings that happens along with that. Plenty of people have no problem eating rice, pasta, etc. and maintaining a healthy weight and life style. I‚Äôve done long term keto so i‚Äôm not knocking it since it helps you lose weight (although i‚Äôve had the exact same results calorie counting on a normal diet minus the few extra pounds of water weight you shed) but any diet that doesn‚Äôt make room for your favorite treats in moderation, the fact to eat most ‚Äúnormal ‚Äú foods you have to make an imitation with almond flour, powdered sugar alcohols, and other speciality ingredients, that restricts your ability t participate in group meals, etc is inherently restrictive. Some people don‚Äôt feel that way and that is awesome for them but it is not ‚Äúinsane‚Äù for people to think it‚Äôs restrictive. Pushing that narrative is just discouraging to people who are having a hard time adjusting or even just staying on keto."
keto,"My lover reported to me today that I smell like ""venison"". Upon further questioning they said it smells like raw meat during slaughter/processing. That the smell is emenating from my body in general, my skin. I have been on the keto diet for about 4 months with great results. This is the first time they have noticed any change in body odor. I can't smell it.
I had just taken a shower.
 I believe I may have dipped out of ketosis about 3 days ago by eating a homemade sugar cookie for Valentine's day. No notable differences except that it was extremely euphoric! 

Has anyone had experiences with smelling like raw meat during ketosis? 
I know this probably sounds like a weird question but it's legit."
keto,"people always make this claim without backing it up... they're usually just repeating what they heard from someone else who was repeating what they heard, etc etc."
keto,Seriously wtf?  I guess this is what Darwin was talking about.
keto,"I hear you.  When my grandpa died (my grandparents basically raised me) I went back to eating my emotions as we both enjoyed food, period. Congrats to both you and your partner! Lifestyle changes are easier and more fun together.  Proud of you!"
keto,I always buy two chickens for dinner so that my wife and I don't fight over one. Keeps my macros and marriage in check.
keto,Have you tried lettuce noodles?
keto,I just had eggplant parmigiana for lunch. I was so happy. I can only make it once it is so rich and filling.
keto,"Bro, I pig out on Bubba burgers everyday and lose weight.  The amount of awesome shit out there with no carbs is a lot more than I would‚Äôve imagined."
keto,"It's only restrictive until you reach the point of changing ""I can't have that"" for ""I don't want that""."
keto,"It's called ""ketoade"" and variations of it have powered about a kajillion keto'ers."
keto,"Yes! I LOVE dark meat. Even before keto, I was always quite happy when, at family gatherings, all the other diners would take the white first. My stepfather and I knew what was up, though."
keto,Crispy skin is the best.....
keto,I've tried a couple different cocktails with stevia and they were... Bad. Let me know how you like the allulose simple üëç
keto,"I have a quick question, does bad cholesterol increase with keto?"
keto,"Chicken thighs are the best, I never really appreciated them before keto but now I love them."
keto,"Are you taking any electrolyte / vitamin powder? I had the keto flu very badly in the first week (actually vomiting and exhausted). So I started researching and everything I read said keto dieters should be taking an electrolyte supplement. 

When I did low carb in the past I constantly felt low on energy but I wasn't taking any sort of supplement. Now that I have one every day I don't feel tired or nauseous at all. Also have you looked up keto bakeries or recipes? There's some really good stuff out there! I allow myself a couple of keto treats a week and it's really helped me feel less restricted."
keto,"This is a mindset issue that only you can choose to solve.  

There is no magic bullet to starting or restarting or continuing. Nobody can give you motivation. 
 
Ultimately you build discipline and commit, or you don't. Control and motivation are not about willpower really, they are about discipline, creating a new normal, and also goals. The scale itself is often not enough motivation, and motivation can only get you so far versus discipline. 

As you have noticed, motivation is fleeting and can be affected by external factors. But discipline and building something into your daily habit can help ensure success even when you don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúmotivated‚Äù in a given moment to continue as you‚Äôve been going.

Discipline is basically building good habits and sticking to them. You have to ask yourself what is more important to you: being less fat in a month or having a candy bar now? What is going to provide more long term satisfaction?

Frankly there is always an excuse to cheat. There is always an upcoming holiday or birthday or graduation or quincenara or bar mitzvah or other celebration or someone decided to just bring cookies to work or you go out to dinner and order a sandwich instead of something else. There is always an excuse, if you want it bad enough you will just not make excuses.

Which is not to say it isn't difficult, it IS to say that committing is what is necessary especially when you are in an environment where others eat other things.

Stress happens, keto or no. I‚Äôm a busy person, I manage to plan, meal prep, and keep keto. I go out with friends when stressed and keep keto. Don‚Äôt let stress or being busy be your excuse. 

With regard to emotional eating, if you‚Äôre doing that, develop other/better coping strategies that actually address the underlying feelings. ""Eating your feelings"" is just a bandaid and does not actually get to the deeper issue. 

A lot of people also say that thinking, ""I no longer eat that"" is a more helpful mindset versus ""I can't have that.""

If you cheat and fail, reflect critically on why it happened, don't go into a shame spiral - make a plan for the next time the situation comes up, because it will, and think about a better way to handle it.

Committing to changes that improve your health can be hard. Being fat is also hard. Choose your hard and stop making excuses. You have to want it, nobody can want it for you. Commit or don‚Äôt - it‚Äôs your body and only you have to live in it."

keto,"Stats? Macros? Food scale? Tracking app?

Testing ketones is pointless."
keto,"https://calculo.io/keto-calculator ‚Üê this one.

Please set your activity level to sedentary as the calculator wildly overestimates calories burned from exercise"
keto,"Ketosis means low or no insulin.

Insulin reduces metabolic rate.

It is a fact that type one diabetics (can't produce insulin) have a higher metabolic rate that normal counter parts.

One of the first symptoms of type one diabetes is unintended weight loss.

By entering and saying in ketosis your metabolic rate increases."
keto,"How have you determined that you are losing muscle?  You need to visit a doctor and have your lean body mass measured on a very special scale or through scanning.

keto,"I love this. I think I‚Äôll borrow your idea, thank you üíó"
keto,Ketosis != fat loss. Your ketone levels are irrelevant to this issue. What is your calorie intake? Stalled since late 2019 means you're eating at maintenance. You need to eat less. Common problem with a very simple solution.
keto,"It's so good you're in treatment, I hope something will alleviate the depression for you soon. Hugs"
keto,"Congrats on figuring this stuff out. It is really hard to fight the stuff that goes on in our heads.

For me, it's been a little different. I'm down around 100 lbs in 11 months, with a few months of ""regular"" eating (some of it quite bad) included in that time.  I broke my leg and kind of lost a lot of hope. It wasn't ideal, but it also helped me to figure something out about this ""for the rest of my life"" thinking, which I'm prone to as well. It doesn't have to be for the rest of your life, exactly. Maybe you will always need to limit carbs to keep the weight off, but it doesn't have to be every single day for all of eternity. Most, maybe. But there is room, even in weight loss mode, to take the day and eat carbs on Thanksgiving, or cake on someone's birthday, or your favorite food for whatever reason. That just cannot be every day. It cannot be most days. And it's really best to plan it in advance rather than giving in to emotional eating in the moment. 

 I do understand that many people have a hard time coming back to keto after a cheat day, but for me, it gets easier the more times I do it. Sort of an inevitable thing - the sun will set, I will sleep, tomorrow will be a new day, and I will eat keto again. There's not necessarily one perfect way to do it, especially long-term, and I appreciate that not everyone can bounce back. That's just what's going on with me, and it has alleviated the ""for the rest of my life"" stuff."
keto,"And many people are put off by keto when they get into it and find that they aren't feeling better, aren't getting the hormonal improvements they should be, because they are still eating crap.

keto,"I absolutely hated keto cereal, It had a weird hard texture and tasted bad. Some things just can‚Äôt be replaced I think"
keto,"Yes it definitely helped with confidence levels at first and an overall feeling of well being. With treatment with two different medications I was feeling really good. But I let the negativity take over again and when you let that happen, it doesn‚Äôt matter."
keto,"This is r/keto not r/cleaneating. I answer in that context. And in the context of keto, eat what fits your macros to stay in ketosis is 100% valid. It may not be the 100% perfect diet but it's way better than them continuing to eat SAD. It certainly is not ""dangerous"". Let them take baby steps and once they are keto for a few months they will likely gravitate towards cleaner eating on their own as long as they are not scared off keto entirely by feeling like it's all or nothing. 

If you don't like that, that's your right and I don't call you out when you give your advice. I only ask the same in return."
keto,"Well let's see, you will lose about 8 lb of water weight initially, so we need to lose 17 pounds of fat in 8 weeks.  that's a little over 2lb of fat a week, or around a 1000 calorie deficit a day.  For someone your size that's like a 50% deficit.  Is it possilble? Sure.  But you'll feel pretty awful doing it. Why 25lb and why 2 weeks?  Where did these numbers come from?

Intermittent fasting tends to just happen on keto because your hunger is low.

You are imposing a 2 month finish line on what should be a lifelong pursuit of health.  I am not sure this is a healthy way to go about this."
keto,"That makes sense. I‚Äôm about a week from being a month in, and I‚Äôm in ketosis. I‚Äôm think I‚Äôm not consuming enough fat to satiate me, and I‚Äôm eating too much."
keto,"My perspective after 2 years on a ketogenic diet is that my mood is definitely more even keeled. I don‚Äôt have the huge ups and downs that I did before keto. It took me a while to find the right way and time to eat along with the right supplements but once I did it has been great. 

For those struggling with the fogginess early on, I recommend supplementing with electrolytes. I found that switching to light salt (one with both potassium and sodium) combined with a good magnesium supplement helped tremendously."
keto,"Loved reading this! Congrats to you!! I‚Äôve been combining IF with Keto this time round after previously just doing Keto. It‚Äôs pretty good! 
I am being spurred on by my clothing fitting better, it‚Äôs only been 2.5 weeks! 
How did you manage the binge eating? That was and is my biggest problem along with rewarding any feelings with food (happy, sad, lonely etc) 
I am doing well with it all atm but the thoughts are creeping in to ‚Äújust have one binge‚Äù 
I‚Äôve probably been on a diet since I was like 12. I‚Äôm now a bit older than you at 34, turning 35 this year and I‚Äôm so sick of not living my life or missing out on things so for some reason this time feels more serious and determined.

You probably aren't losing muscle."
keto,"I get that but there's a line between ""eat what you want if it fits your macros""/""don't be bullied into eating whole foods"" and ""gtfo if you don't eat perfectly clean"".

I can care less what you eat, it's your decision and I won't try to compel you try eat any given way. That being said I think it's good, on a sub related to getting healthy, to have the information that certain foods are better than others, and I think it's dangerous disinformation when people push ideas like ""no such thing as clean and dirty keto"" and ""if it fits your macros it's good to go""."

keto,oh no :( how long have you been on the diet?
keto,"I did that while I was in my first month of research.  I used up some of the carby stuff I had but the night before I went strict keto and did my shop I still gave away 5 bags of groceries.  I didn't want to throw stuff out so as I used up the vegetable oil and mayo and replaced with healthier choices.  It took about a month to get used to doing with less carbs and when I went clean keto and dropped the carbs I stuck with meat, cheese, eggs and fat for a few weeks until I was fat adapted.  I had cravings during that time as I went through carb withdrawel."
keto,"No. It's not. But I see people get very judgemental on here if people still want to include some processed foods. I'd rather see people eating keto with a little bit of ""junk"" mixed in than have them give up on keto because they think they have to give up everything."
keto,"Thank you so much :) You got it right, I am a bit of miser that way, and still wear my EU size 54 winter jacket, when I am now 46 :P I am reluctant to buy clothes mainly because I know that these will last only for another two months at best and don't want to burn cash unnecessarily."

keto,Just keto and the resulting weight loss.
keto,[This youtube channel has been my go to as of late.](https://www.youtube.com/c/ketoserts/videos)  I like that the person making the videos doesn't talk and fill the videos with any fluff.
keto,My plan includes 1/4 cup of berries a day.  I make raspberry keto jam for toast as well but I also eat the fresh ones or blueberries with whipped cream.  I'm low carb during the summer so enjoy a peach when they are in season.  I do clean keto OMAD the rest of the time.  You don't have to do without everything.  Just count the carbs.  Your body reacts differently to carbs from fruit or veggies than it does to keto fake and bake.
keto,"I couldn't agree more. May I ask, for how long have you been doing it and what changes have you noticed with respect to PCOS?"
keto,"They put me on keto and IF partly to see if it would help with my chronic fatigue, but the comment about calories was in general, not about me. Hydration and electrolytes weren‚Äôt an issue for me. This was the most research-based, on-the-ball GP I‚Äôve had."
keto,Thank you ‚úå‚ù§
keto,That's why I only count total carbs and don't fool around trying to figure out net.  Too much confusing math and labelling.
keto,Thank you.
keto,Thank you :) I'm sure you didn't have to lose as much as I did.
keto,You will need to calculate your lean mass first and then set your protein intake at 1 gram per pound of this lean mass. Make sure you get this amount or more every day. Also a little big of strength training will help to maintain the muscle you have while you are in a deficit to lose body fat.
keto,"Congratulations on shedding so much weight! I was able to lose the amount I did, as I was morbidly obese. As you only have about 25 kg to lose, your path is relatively tougher than mine and soon I will be at the place where you started. So, we just need to keep striving :) Plus, losing weight slowly is better for our skin. So yeah, be proud of yourself!"
keto,"That's what the fat is for, to keep you feeling full until you are fat adapted."
keto,Congratulations.  My doctor is suspect of my glucose level.  I know I'm prediabetic because of the weight but look forward to keto straightening that mess out.
keto,"What tends to happen to me is that I start craving carbs again, and then I lose my focus on eating healthy in general. Some people can eat that many carbs and still be in minor ketosis."
keto,I was the same for the first month.  Didn't know what I was doing really but knew I had to get my carbs under 20.  I just concentrated on getting the carb demon under control.  I was in ketosis on day 3 and fat adapted around week 4.  I was worried about fat consumption too but realized that the ketogenic protocol is different than any 'diet' I had tried before.  I just trusted the process and the science behind it.
keto,I'm sure if you're consistent it'll be fine! I have hashimoto's too. My symptoms are flaring up today which makes me want to cheat!
keto,"Thank you very much. Keto has also taught me an important life skill and that is patience. When I started this journey in Aug, I set goals for myself, such as by end of Month A, I want to lose X kg. When it didn't happen, I was not disappointed as I am honestly invested in the journey itself more than the goal per se."
keto,"It's an interesting question, because as noted keto is diuretic by nature. Adding low sodium to keto leads to an unhealthy low sodium situation - headache, fatigue, muscle cramps, etc. Adding sodium to keto does not create water retention, it just maintains healthy sodium levels.

So obv, you're in a situation re keto where medical advice is much needed!"
keto,"Almond meal and almond flour will give you very different textures.  So that right there is a big difference. Also, unless you took into account the difference of sweetness levels between stevia and other sweeteners, I wouldn't use Stevia in a recipe at the same amounts because it's much sweeter.  Try to stick to the sweetener that a recipe calls for unless you have done the math on how to convert for recipes."
keto,"This sounds very strange to me. Were you losing muscle or feeling fatigued all the time? There is no floor on eating calories daily, that's why Intermittent fasting has been so popular in the last several years. Overweight and obese people have plenty of energy stored on their bodies: hydration is the main trouble on keto, not getting enough calories."
keto,"If you're on mobile look for ""About"" at the top of the page."
keto,"Thank you. Yes, its more of a mental game than anything else. But as the benefits easily outweigh the cravings, it motivated me to stay on track. I wish you good luck too, if you're someone looking to lose weight as well :)"
keto,"You don't. Some people feel more comfortable tracking everything, others like myself just track ""net carbs"" (total carbs - fiber - (some) sugar alcohols). Do what feels comfortable to you: if you see results and you feel better after a few weeks, stick to it. Good luck!"
keto,I gave myself permission to eat as many hard boiled eggs as I wanted.  I still keep them in the fridge at all times.  I've been keto 2 years.
keto,Artificial sweeteners are appetite disruptors and that is the main danger.  There are actually many studies that when people are just eating to full they will eat more when they drink a sweetened beverage with it even if that beverage is artificially sweetened and has no calories.
keto,"""detox"" lol"
keto,If you're still in the first month you're likely still in transition.  Fat consumption is not a goal.  Are you in ketosis?
keto,"Myprotein whey isolate is cheap, lab-tested, tasty, and 1g carb for 25g of protein.  Plus you can get it unflavored which I like"
keto,"My god, that is an incredible journey! I've lost weight on keto being largely sedentary. It's the only diet I know of where it's possible to do this without feeling starved all the time. You've proved it in spades, remarkable!!"
keto,I've been keto 2years and start the day by filling up my water glass with cold water and 1/4 teaspoon 'salt free' potassium.  I also take about 1/4 teaspoon of PHS 3-4 times daily and just wash it down with water to supplement minerals.  I notice a lag if I forget.
keto,"No, it's not a dumb post!!!   I am in the same position.  I'm addicted to sweets.  I'm just beginning this journey.  It is good to know there is someone out there like me that made it through the holiday.  My family and my fianc√©'s clients always send candy and baked goods for holidays  It just feel impossible to get out from under all of the sugar.  But I'm ready to try.  Thank you for your story!  Glad that you made it!"
keto,I think there was some effect.  I have stopped taking 11 of 12 prescriptions and 4 of them were for mental health issues.  2 years keto
keto,Thank you very much.. I am very new to reddit so im off to find this side bar u speak of üòÅ‚úå‚ù§
keto,"&gt;Eating is good and what kind of healthy eating won't let you have a pear?!?

And yet, what percentage of sugar did you consume that came from fresh fruit? üòã Its the slippery slope of glucose index for sure. One minute, it's that little heart donut I had for Valentine's yesterday (it's a holiday...right??), pretty soon, it's a few cookies, maybe a small helping of pasta, then you figure you can (yet again) just control portion sizes of all that high carb, sugary crap our society calls ""food"" and get away with it. I've been off the wagon too, and it can be fun for awhile, until the weight creeps back up and those nice clothes don't fit comfortably. You got this, OP, healthy eating is for life!"
keto,"The problem my friends was never food. We who are here, have some psychological issues to deal with.

 So, Can we do it on our own? Sometimes works, but that is mostly how we got here. With a friend? Maybe. With a professional? Maybe. 

I have found a few things that work for me somewhat. I do hope that we each do find a method that works for us. But I am risking a pummeling by pointing to the elephant in the room. (Pun a coincidence) -because the real root of our problem psychological.

OP I salute you for taking another run at it and not giving up! You are inspiring! And I hope you find and address the issues that make you want to eat. For me, I think I've needed much more love in my life and have been trying to eat my way there."
keto,"Use the  calculator in the sidebar to set macros, re-calculate every 10 lbs. Eat protein first, it is a goal to meet or exceed. Carbs are a limit, Fat is for satiety only, it is fine to be under that macro and let stored fat sub in. If you do not excercize, adding in bodyweight calesthenics can be easy and convenient, lots of vids and programs on YT. Congrats on the loss to date, keep going!"
keto,"But be sure to record everything you eat to be sure.  Hidden carbs everywhere.  I record before I eat it now. 
Good luck!"
keto,Any update on this?
keto,Wow!  Nice job!  Bet that feels just great!  Keep it up.  I‚Äôm looking to join you in losing more too!
keto,Yep. Always aiming at 20 :)
keto,"As I read it The high carb numbers like 50 are for top athletes and those that are fat adapted long term keto people.   Go with your own body macros, using 20ish and lower I bet."
keto,I have a small spot I am thinking is the same. :/ my cholesterol tested fine but I will see a dermatologist soon.
keto,Wow!  Great job!  Keep it up!  Bet you have to spend a lot on new smaller clothes lol!   I‚Äôm working to get there.
keto,"Yup, finding this out myself after 5 months. Just not hungry, minimal cravings....sometimes have to work to eat enough.  I‚Äôm liking how I feel on keto."
keto,"It‚Äôs very complicated but kinda easy to....
For me, type two diabetic, I use ketoses to keep the insulin produced in the body lower and steady.  In ketoses and when you are fat adapted you are effectively burning fats and proteins and as needed the fat from your body.   Fewer and lower sugar spikes need lower insulin and your body opens the fat cells to feed you as needed. 

When you are out of ketoses the body wants carbs, which spike your insulin and cause your fat cells to be tougher to let fat out. Also causes cravings for more.  It wants to store that extra unused carbs as fat right away, to use for the zombie apocalypse!

Think of a bonfire...carbs/sugars are kindling burning fast and smoky and then gone.  Fats and proteins a large log burning slow and steady and clean. ( which keeps you fuller longer). 

The more I read the more I fear carbs and sugar..does many nasty things to your body."
keto,"How do you know you are losing muscle mass?

How many grams of protein per pound of lean body mass are you currently eating?

What does your current exercise regimen look like?"
keto,I personally will ration my carb count in the summer for a real whole peach and still stay in ketosis. Best. Treat. EVERR.
keto,I agree with everything you‚Äôve written!
keto,This was based upon an average of my daily caloric intake back last year.
keto,"I paid for premium. It wasn‚Äôt cheap. I hate the update. I don‚Äôt find it user friendly, quite the opposite. They have totally changed the app without warning. It‚Äôs ridiculous! Not everyone is IT savy."
keto,Great advice. Thanks for sharing your journey! Forever is a long time!
keto,"You should set a reasonable caloric deficit of 20%, and then when you calculate your macros that will determine how much fat would be part of that."
keto,"Interesting thought, will buy almond flour for the next cake ocasion."
keto,???
keto,"You may have better luck with the monkfruit sweeteners, they‚Äôre great for baking."
keto,Good luck!
keto,Although you‚Äôre about 6‚Äù taller! I wonder how much height has to do with weight loss. If we‚Äôre the same weight but significantly different in height do our bodies burn calories at a different rate?
keto,"Correct. I started my Keto journey on the 6.2.21. 

Also today is my birthday so wanted to make sure, that I have a keto substitute for cake/desserts as I don't want to make a cheat day.

But it more and more looks like I wont have any - keto or not - sweets.

&amp;#x200B;

Hmm, imo stevia tastes not gross just slightly wierd. I came accross the ""recipe"" to make your own sweeter as a mix of stevia and erithrol. It tastes allright"
keto,There‚Äôs always another one out there üòÇ
keto,"Eggs have a pretty high satiety factor. I typically eat at least 3 per day. 

I found that eating 2 solid meals with the fat that comes from the eggs or salmon, for example, I felt more full than by kind of grazing, if that makes sense? Not sure what your eating pattern looks like."
keto,You can learn more about the biochemistry over at Virta Health's blog.
keto,Thanks! I love kefir. I was vegan before starting keto so had forgotten all about it and had no idea it had so much protein. Looking forward to reincorporating it!
keto,I have hashimotos. I lost 11 lbs since Jan 14 but then I had a piece of cake with my GF yesterday for valentines but now I‚Äôm back to it. Hopefully this doesn‚Äôt mess stuff up too much for me.
keto,"I see you like dumplings me too ;) yum cha is our favourite family Saturday morning treat we have every month or so. But now I eat the naked plates of roast pork, roast duck, and stem broccoli (ask them to cook fresh with oyster sauce on the side, so you can dip the tiniest bit on for flavour). Drink up that green tea too. Make a judgement call on the skin, some places put a sweet lacquer on, some don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm missing out at all and I‚Äôm giving a good shot at eating within my macros."
keto,"I‚Äôm in ketosis rn. I started 2 weeks ago on feb 1st. I just literally do not like dairy products and I hate cheese. I usually eat a lot of fats and protein like steak, sausages, chicken, salmon, shrimp, avocado, eggs and coconut oils. Veges are broccolinnie, eggplant, green beans, and greens like bok choy/yu choy. I drink water and 1 cup of plain black coffee everyday consistently. I do not touch any dairy or cheese and I‚Äôm positive I‚Äôm in ketosis. My breath smells so bad and so does urine. It‚Äôs horrible. My sweat also smells pretty bad but it seems like it‚Äôs easily masked with bathing and deodorant. My clothes fit better, I stopped snoring, and I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm much less drowsy tired than before. So I say, yea you can do it without cheese. I think you gotta eat more fatty foods tho."
keto,"Follow your macros and count calories but for real like measure and weigh things to be sure, don‚Äôt just count on your eyes. Metabolically, it‚Äôs not possible to be your current weight if you‚Äôve been eating less than 1000 calories a day because according to most calorie calculators like this one, you would need 2000 calories just to stay at your current weight. So once you start counting and stop guessing, you‚Äôre going to see great results!! 

https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html"
keto,Maybe like a year but I was blessed with minimal stretch marks which I think would have made it harder .
keto,"I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre female since 1200 is the minimum for women.

At your height and weight, you really should be aiming around 1600‚Äì1800 for a calorie deficit (assuming TDEE is around 2,000 calories).

1200 is too low and can actually slow your metabolism/mess with your hormones. Are you eating lunch? How are your stress levels? I know when I get stressed I don‚Äôt eat and don‚Äôt feel hungry.

I am 5‚Äô0 and I eat around 1250-1300 calories a day. I‚Äôve had no issues losing about 15lb the last few months. My TDEE is only around 1500. At 5‚Äô7, I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea to aim for eating as much as someone 5‚Äô0.

I really don‚Äôt mean to offend. Your calorie goals do concern me and I totally support intuitive eating to an extent.

You can beef up your calorie intake by adding more fat. Add some heavy cream to your protein shakes. When making lunch/dinner, add an extra tablespoon of olive oil/butter. For dessert, strawberries with some whipped cream. If you‚Äôre worried about the protein, add peanut butter. Eat babybel cheese as a snack while making dinner.

You need the calories, especially if you are exercising while also on keto. Remember, keto is moderate protein, high fat.

If you insist on eating around 1200, here‚Äôs what I do to make sure I never go under.

Coffee: 50-60 calories (cold brew + 1 tbsp heavy cream + splash of almond milk)
Meals: 450 calories (2 meals)
Snacks: 300 calories (however I choose to split it up

Total: 1200-1260"
keto,"cycling = continued cravings for a carb addict.  This may also be very bad for your liver switching in and out of ketosis weekly (studies are inconclusive at this point)

keto = fat adaption and a disappearance of the carb cravings.

Give keto 2 months (may happen sooner, but 2 months is a safe plan) to get fully fat adapted and your addiction should be in check.  While doing that, eat whole foods, not processed junk like Atkins bars and don't treat yourself to low calorie sweetener versions of sweet treats because the addiction is as much mental as physical so just having the sweet of artificial sweetener hit your tongue triggers a craving for more sweets. You can add these back in moderation once you're fat adapted and can control the cravings.

If you have chocolates on Sunday, just forget any progress you've made toward getting past the flu. Keto is not a diet you can cheat on like that.  You can go over calories and just lose that day's progress but if you go over carbs and go out of ketosis, it's more like a 3-5 day loss plus whatever days it takes to make up for the weight you gain from the chocolates.   And there's risk of dealing with the flu again.

If you really want to do this, you need to re-evaluate your relationship with food. Why is having chocolates so important just because there's a few words on a calendar saying it's some special day?

It's pretty rare that anyone gets a serious keto flu if they are, in fact, hydrating enough and getting enough electrolytes.   Sports drink electrolytes are a complete lie. They only give you enough to replace maybe 1/10th of what you sweat out when you're working out.  You need exponentially more.  The exact values are in the FAQ here which I suspect you haven't read based on your questions.

Who made your meal plan?  Are you positive of the values (most of them on the internet are inaccurate) and did you weigh every ingredient on a food scale?  Not doing so means you have no idea what macros you're getting because 1 tablespoon of sauce vs 3 can be very significant, for example.

Starting keto without weighing and tracking everything that enters your mouth is a recipe for failure.  But if you follow the basic rules, it's actually quite easy to stick to and see real progress."
keto,How long did it take to tighten up?
keto,Read the faq. Twice
keto,"Except you're supposed to eat MORE salt on keto than when you're not. Stop talking nonsense, 20 pounds is not water weight. She's done really well for herself"
keto,It‚Äôs ok to have some dim sum for Chinese New Year.  Just get back to keto and you‚Äôll be fine.
keto,"I‚Äôm restarting after Valentine‚Äôs Day after being super strict September-Thanksgiving and off and on up until now.

I have the same stats as you! Kind of. 5‚Äô started at 130ish. My last weigh in was last week at 116. I‚Äôve been verrry lenient the last 2 weeks so I‚Äôve decided not to weight myself for a bit until I get back into my groove.

Honestly, the first 10lb came off SO easily since it‚Äôs mostly water. I think you‚Äôll hit your goal sooner than you think.

I‚Äôm hoping to get down to 110 by June. I think it‚Äôs doable but I need to be a lot stricter than I have been. Carbs hold onto water in the body so the more I divy from my macros, the more water my body will hold.

It‚Äôs definitely tricky for us petite ladies! Doing keto has been a great COVID project because so few distractions. No office treats, happy hours, etc (at least where I‚Äôm at).

Good luck! You got this. Lite salt is available at most grocery stores and is a great way of getting some extra electrolytes."
keto,I think using the term 'common sense' is asking for a down vote.
keto,It's mostly avoidable though.  Pour that electrolyte enriched water down your through like you're in the Sahara!
keto,"I'd probably suggest Swerve with liquid stevia.  That Stevia will really amp up the sweet and you shouldn't need a lot to top off the swerve so that reduces the aftertaste that I and others dislike with Stevia (some people don't taste the after taste, apparently)"
keto,"You said you ate it because you ""dont want to waste food"". You need to retrain your brain to recognize that carbs are not actually food anymore. So don't feel bad wasting carbs by just throwing them out."
keto,What are the symptoms? Do you get them from other dairy ordering as well?
keto,"Ive been doing fasting on and off for a few years but added in keto around a month ago. Don't know how much I've lost because I don't weigh myself. I lift a lot of weights and have put on muscle so I don't like to use weight as a gauge. I've slimmed down for sure and definately put on muscle. I'm down a belt notch. 

Did this combination for a few months last year and lost around 15kg."
keto,"Yup,  lost weight with Keri and exercise and apnea went away."
keto,"Hey it happens some times. Key is to just remember it's just the food from day prior and it goes away sharpish. Drink lots of water, sometimes I even fast till dinner time and I feel great again the next day!"
keto,The keto train has many people who hop on any train really. So the gain after is because healthy habits weren't really obtained long-term.
keto,the keto flu is no joke i had it a couple years back when i hopped back on keto and i felt absolutely awful
keto,"A larger deficit principally is a wider scope for hitting a psychological calorie rebound (in my opinion). The smaller the deficit, the greater the chance you have of succeeding long term. 

That, along with the likely severe performance impact (even the basics like walking around the house) you would probably feel like shit and begin to catabolise muscle in lieu of glycogen and fats.
 
I review my loss curve and when it begins to level out, i re-adjust my calories and macros and it has worked very well for me."
keto,I loooove almond unsweetened vanilla milk in my iced coffee. But I've also tried Keto Creamers in my hot coffee. Idk what I prefer. Depends on the day. Depends in what you like and whats going to be satisfactory and sustainable.
keto,I think they meant losing that much weight so quickly isn't sustainable. Not the lifestyle part.
keto,"See, my question with these is if the ‚Äútapioca fiber‚Äù is actual tapioca fiber or is this like the Costco Protein Bar situation where they‚Äôre actually much higher carb than advertised due to them using a loophole in what‚Äôs considered ‚Äútapioca‚Äù. I considered buying these and didn‚Äôt due to that first ingredient."
keto,"It is perfectly reasonable to get your macros and micros in with 12-1400 calories. Don't be an idiot. How much micro do you think you lose by cutting out piles of butter? 

It's easy peasy to hit macro goals and get micro without a problem. Why? Eat leafy greens, leaner proteins.Take a multivitamin. Don't eat bacon. Like wtf, it's common sense to realize that if you eat clean good food you don't need a bunch of food. 

Yeah, each meal isn't going to be some fat kid bacon party, but broccoli and chicken thighs are pretty fuckin bomb stir fried together with some spices, which gives low net carbs and high protein goodness and a fair amount of fat."
keto,"My doctor recently started me on a keto diet for health reasons and it‚Äôs been helping with my condition but I have been a bit concerned. I only started keto a few weeks ago but I‚Äôve already dropped 20 lbs, is that normal? I told my doctor but he didn‚Äôt seem too concerned."
keto,"Gluconeogenesis is not a bad thing. You literally need your body to do this or you would die. Not every cell in your body can run solely on ketones for energy. Some require glycolysis. That includes your brain. 

Ever wonder why people on keto don't go into hypoglycemic events? (Change in mental status, coma, seizures) Our blood sugar isn't 0 even though we're not eating significant carbs, and thankfully that's because of gluconeogenesis."
keto,"Buy frozen beef marrow bones and add to your diet. Simply soak overnight in salted water, then roast until hot thru. 3 oz spread on your vital gluten bread is another 600 calories, and it comes packed with collagen. I remove the raw marrow from the bones and slip it into soups and sauces. Delicious and inexpensive! 3 oz of marrow will cost between 3 to 5 bucks. I always feel incredibly good after a marrow meal!"
keto,"The water weight conversation online has slowly shifted from ‚Äúthe first 5lbs-10lbs is bloat‚Äù to ‚Äúanything you lose in your first month is water weight‚Äù which absolutely is not true. Weight loss noticeably slows after 10lbs. Not to mention that heavier people lose weight faster, and it‚Äôs such an inaccurate blanket statement."
keto,"That works as long as it works.

I find it easy to gain weight even if I'm in ketosis at 20 net carbs.

Ketosis is driven by how many carbs one eats. Weight is primarily driven by how much one eats."
keto,"I keep hoping. I've lost a lot. It's better, but not gone. I still sleep with my cpap."
keto,"I‚Äôve had a hard time during the holidays, after my last and latest cheat meal 3 weeks ago. I felt like it wasnt worth the great taste for those 10 minutes and its gonna take me 3 days to get back in ketosis. Get to your goal by all means, but don‚Äôt feel too guilty if you slip up. You have all the time in the world to get back on track and honestly, this diet gets you to your goal quick. Stick to it if you can, you‚Äôll thank yourself later when you start seeing visual results."
keto,"It depends on the size. The calculators tell me that the TDEE at my starting weight was 4925, but 2025 if/when I drop 450 pounds.

If we're talking long term, why wouldn't I just use the lower TDEE instead of a small deficit on my starting weight? That **is** the long term goal."
keto,Exactly. Rib eye instead of sirloin. Thighs instead of breast.
keto,"Different formula. Look at the ingredient list.  The UPC is the same so they've changed the formula and you have a different version than what's on the website.  

Looks like yours is lower total carbs so maybe it's newer and they changed it to lower carbs.  Or alternately yours is an old version and they added some carb heavy ingredients to improve taste. 

Just use the numbers on the one you have."
keto,I've lost the same amount as OP in the same timeframe and it's definitely not water weight. Maybe the first few pounds but beyond that..
keto,How long have you been doing Keto and IF and how much weight have you lost if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? Thank you! I‚Äôm going to try my best not to give in to junk food
keto,"Do not beat yourself up for this.  
Just continue keto and try not to have cheat meals again.   
It will get easier. Set a goal, like ""1 week without any cheat meals"". One week will pass and the cravings will be less, I promise.  


Keto on!"
keto,"Girrrrrl, I say this with love, it's just one meal from one day. It fucking happens! You're only human and you're barely starting. Give yourself a break and just start back up. One time...I had a couple bites of my son's left over pizza. Best bite of my life followed by beating myself up for eating carbs. The point is to be healthy.  Which means to have a healthy outlook on your food, your body, and yourself. You got this. Pick yourself up and keep going."
keto,"you will be fine. if you feel good, dont worry."
keto,"By not eating carbs to begin with, honestly.  When you drop out of ketosis from bingeing on carbs, you are going to feel like complete crap.  Not really any way around that. You can minimize it some but drinking 4x the water you normally would because part of what you're feeling is dehydration because the glucose has no spare water to transport it so it had to draw from tissue.

Keto is not a diet you can really get away with cheating on.  You can go over calories and just not progress for 48 hours, but if you drop out of ketosis, it's unforgiving and often another 2-4 days wasted getting back into it and another potential bout of keto flu."
keto,"You should look up Cristy Nickel and her Code Red program. She talks a lot about stalled weight loss and the foods that can cause this, including cheese and other keto friendly foods. To get some of the information you have to sign up and pay for the program, but I know she has a YouTube channel, and there‚Äôs probably other free resources online."
keto,Thank you!! One oh the apps gave me something similar to these macros. The one thing I found myself going over was the protein (65g) and just didn‚Äôt feel like that was right.
keto,"I've found Carb Manager's calculator to not be that accurate.  I suggest using the one on this sub.  CM's seems to be stuck on therapeutic keto mostly.

At 1200 though you should be fine.. but best to just put in the values as Custom in your Carb Manager and not trust it to set them for you.

Also keep in mind that females loss slower than males and tend to take a bit longer to get momentum as well.  But, at the very least, you should have lost 5-8 lbs of water weight the 48 hours after entering ketosis so something seems amiss."
keto,Wonderworks keto cereal and unsweetened almond milk.
keto,I keep sardines and pork rinds in my desk in case I forget my lunch.  Great combo.
keto,"OMG that sounds delicious! Totally agree with all of your other tips too. I've saved this meal idea, thank you! Yummmmmmm"
keto,"You make a point. I mean, if she only knew you could BYON (bring your own noodles) or she could grab some shiritakis from WF for $3 she probably wouldn‚Äôt have said it."
keto,I like carb manager they just updated it!
keto,I wish I knew about that before yesterday. KETO FLU SUCKS.
keto,"If you are still losing weight, go for it, but I would be curious if you would continue to lose weight if your metabolism slowed down from no"
keto,I use keto milk (1/3 HWC and 2/3 water) it's saved me I can't tolerate the flavor of most of the other options.
keto,"The problem with eating at too high a deficit is that your body doesn't want to burn off extra fat.  It stores calories as fat for a reason, so that we have calories available to us when food isn't.  Without food many people would die within weeks, even though food scarcity isn't something most of us will ever face, it's always possible and our bodies are very reluctant to give up that safety net.

So when your body senses a reduction in calories, it adjusts by burning fewer calories, it may also burn some from fat stores, but only what it really has to.  What you really have to ask yourself, is what is your body NOT doing, where was it spending those extra calories that now it isn't?  And how much damage is that going to do your health long term, even if you don't notice it right now?"
keto,I've been doing the same thing. Keto and IF are a perfect match because they both suppress hunger. Good luck with your goals.
keto,LOLOLLOLOLOLL JEWJEJWJEWJEJWEJW JEW JEW JEW
keto,"Everyone always talks about calories in and calories out. I eat anything and as much as I want that keeps me under 20 total carbs a day. Yet, I still lose weight."
keto,Try Miralax. It helps pull water into your stool.
keto,"I‚Äôm not an expert but I assume this is the case. As for calories on the nutrition facts label all of my products (So Nourished) are 0. I actually use these in my bulletproof coffee because 0 net carbs and 0 calories, although I do add plenty of fats so I have sufficient caloric intake for my mornings."
keto,I can definitely trying fasting for 18:6 on my days but off as it would be easier then 16-17 hr fast on work days :) wish I started my keto diet sooner!
keto,"Thank you for your encouragement &lt;3 I‚Äôm actually so surprised that I haven‚Äôt craved for any desserts or even a bag of chips.. which I always look for when I get off work.

keto,"https://cholesterolcode.com/ Dave's got you covered

generally i'd say, if you don't eat junk, such as sugar, plant oils and see positive results and feel good, i wouldn't even care about cholesterol levels, at all.

What is the main problem is, heart disease risk is commonly measured based on cholesterol levels.(because it doesnt require fancy equipment) 

Cholesterol levels can be higher in people, with arterial plaque.

arterial plaque is caused by... inflammation. 

what causes inflammation?

carbs and plant oil (and smoking etc)

If you're worried about your heart disease risk, you need to get a ""coronary calcium scan"" or a CCS(sometimes called CAS)

This is an X-ray test, which can check the levels of plaque in your arteries.

This is the best, most exact way of measuring your ACTUAL risk of heart disease.

Here's Shawn Baker's CCS, after a couple of years of eating a carnivore diet:

keto,"&gt;but any data out there that suggest WHY a larger deficit will cause a problem with proper nutrients? Why am I not hungry if my body needs more calories? 

I'm sure there's data and it's all out there on the internet somewhere. It's not physically possible if eating at a 45% deficit under one's total daily energy expenditure to get all of the macro and micronutrients a body needs. I don't understand how that's not immediately obvious. You're eating 45% *less* fuel than your body needs to do everything it does all day, and that's not to mention all the tiny little micronutrients that go out the window when the macros are that low. Yknow, like vitamins, essential fatty acids, that kinda shit that keeps us alive? And to boot, you're exercising on top of that. Why? What's your goal with the exercise, just to burn calories? Physical fitness? Building muscle? 

Do you perpetually drive your car around on a quarter tank of gas and let it run on the sediment that accumulates at the bottom of the tank? The absence of stomach cues doesn't mean that fuel is not still required to run bodily processes. Keto is very well known for its hunger suppressing attributes, but not feeling hungry doesn't mean that there aren't still 40 billion tiny little processes going on every second inside our bodies that need raw materials to do their jobs properly. Do you just wait till your car stops on the side of the road to fill the tank? Do you floor it on an eighth of a tank and expect to get from Georgia to California? 

&gt;In what way is this ‚Äúsabotage?‚Äù

Maybe it isn't for you. Maybe your sole focus is immediate, rapid weight loss and you haven't given any thought to the rest. What will you do if the weight loss stops at your current level? Go even lower? How will you maintain the weight loss after it all comes off? Is this a sustainable plan? Have you *looked* out on the internet for these studies you're asking other people to provide on the diet *you're* consuming?

I get that being fat totally sucks. I understand the desire to want it gone as soon as humanly possible. What I really don't get is doing it in such a way that it's not best supporting and *fueling* your health, vitality and building the strongest, healthiest, leanest version of you that will last you a long, long time, maybe even the rest of your life. I realize people are in a huge hurry and want everything NOW, that was the same mindset that got me fat as a fucking house and it had to go. So do whatever you want, and enjoy yourself."
keto,"Here is an isocaloric study performed over six months in China.  Males were assigned 2100 calories and females 1700 calories of either a low fat, high carb diet, or a low carb, high fat diet.  In this case, the fat used was soybean oil, which is high in mono and polyunsaturated fats.  At the end of the study, there was greater weight gain in the high MUFA (mono-unsaturated fatty acid) and PUFA (polyunsaturated acid) group.  Something is going on here beyond 'X' calories in correlating with 'X' weight gain/loss.

keto,Steak!
keto,Ingredient macros vary by brand greatly and even the exact same product can change every 3 months or so. So always weigh your ingredients on a kitchen scale and enter them into your app as a recipe and let it do the math because that's what you are actually putting on your plate. I never trust macros on recipes I didn't develop personally.

keto,"""horror stories recently about people stopping keto, and gaining more weight than what they started with.""

True of every ""diet"" out there that people use as a short term bandaid for a larger problem: poor, unmanaged eating habits.

What most people miss is your Goal Weight is not a one-and-done thing where you get to the finish line and pat yourself on the back for a job well done. You re-earn your goal weight every day for the rest of your life by continuing to eat smart, knowing (tracking) what you are consuming and/or your weight, and maintaining the habits and discipline that were missing in your previous WOE, just now at a Maintenance calorie level.

Many people say ""I want/need to lose xyz pounds"" and go on a ""diet"" as a short term fix. The right mindset is ""A healthy weight for me is abc"", and follow a way of eating long term that keeps them at that healthy weight."

Also slathering in coconut oil and cocoa butter didn't hurt ;)"
keto,"YMMV, but in my case I was diagnosed with sleep apnea (did sleep study through Kaiser) before Keto. Lost roughly 70 lbs very rapidly, and got to a point where I no longer need CPAP. I had a brief cold/flu (got the COVID test to be sure - came back negative), and began to snore during that time due to congestion. I broke out the old CPAP (felt super depressed doing hooking it up again), but as soon as my cold/flu/congestion went away, CPAP was put away and I haven't snored yet.

Good luck!!"

keto,"So, my daughter is lactose intolerant and we started keto. I just want to mention that the gut bacteria health is extremely important in losing weight and actually important for your entire body. My theory is that it has been incredibly difficult for her to be at a healthy weight in the past due to her being intolerant but continuing to consume dairy because of the inflammation it caused, and because it put her gut bacteria out of wack. There is extensive research on the effects of having a messed up bacteria load in your stomach. 

We are doing keto and cut out all dairy. I am also working on healing her gut by obviously removing the dairy, and having her consume prebiotic and probiotic foods and supplements. I also added a collagen powder to her diet that contains helpful digestive enzymes."

keto,"If its just the the taste.... fruit infused water?   I usually do cucumber and ginger, but I know there are all kinds of recipes for fruit combinations.

Nobody has ever come back with, ‚Äúyou know, you really should eat more sugar‚Äù. I find that ‚Äúcutting out sugar‚Äù elicits admiration from people because it‚Äôs widely regarded as difficult to quit sugar, but everyone knows they should eat less sugar. 

So stop saying ‚Äúketo‚Äù and start saying you heroically cut out sugar!"

keto,"&gt;I‚Äôm confused on what I should change to continue losing weight

Get a food scale. You're eating more calories than you think. Weigh and track before you eat. Plug these grams into your food tracker, feel free to exceed the protein but don't exceed the fat or carbs. Practice patience.

Are you counting your alcohol calories towards your total 1200? Keto is not magic, a caloric deficit is how you will see the scale move.

keto,"That makes a lot of sense. I remember reading somewhere our bodies are built to store excess fat like that because of our hunter gather society thousands of years before to keep our bodies safe in case they don‚Äôt find food? I‚Äôm going to check that book out ASAP, I‚Äôve been really into nutritional science lately. Thank you for the book rec!"

keto,What fasting app do you use?
keto,"If you are truly eating this exact amount every day, using a food scale to weigh your portions, and tracking it all to ensure you‚Äôre on point, then you just need to adjust your expectations and be patient. You are a smaller female with not much to lose, so it is naturally going to come off more slowly. Hell, it took me 5-6 months to lose my last 20lbs and that was with sticking to my macros perfectly, weighing and tracking every morsel I consumed, cutting all alcohol, and never going over my calories every single day. 

If you want to give up, that‚Äôs on you. But really you just need to stick with it and realize that you did not gain it in a few months and you won‚Äôt lose it that quickly either."

And unlike most other allergies, it's not to protein, but to a sugar/carbohydrate (shortened to alpha gal) which ALL mammals have  in their bloodstream, except Old World Monkeys and Humans.  So now that it's in bloodstream you get sick when you ""add to it"", since it's not supposed to be in our blood.    Its also a delayed allergy.  That is what took researchers so long to fiture it out, because people were showing up in ER at 1am in the morning.....6 hours after they had steak for dinner.

keto,"IMO, the calories are a complete ruse. There are mechanisms in the body which control how your body prioritizes fat storage. Insulin's job is to just that. The higher you keep your insulin on a consistent basis (by eating sugar, and eating often), the more your body prioritizes fat storage over other energy-needy things like metabolic functions, muscle repair, etc. 

For a while scientists were debating whether obesity caused the high levels of resting insulin observed in patients, or if having chronically high levels of insulin caused obesity. I'm convinced in the latter. It's elegant. It explains everything. Calories are a distraction. 

Intermittent fasting to increase the body's insulin sensitivity; and keto to eat healthy foods that don't cause as large of a spike in insulin. Those two are golden."
keto,Oh my keto. marry me
keto,Hit or exceed the protein and watch your fat macro magically fill most of the way up all by itself. It's so simple it's almost *too* simple.
keto,"Also, cutting calories is the weight loss.  Cutting carbs to get into ketoses tells your body to burn fat.  And eating protein, fat and low carb helps you feel fuller longer."

keto,How do you do your tuna casserole omg?!
keto,"Hi u/StableAbel,

I strongly recommend the book ""The Obesity Code"" by Dr. Jason Fung. It's really insightful. I think it explains why Keto works better than anything else I've ever read.

Dr. Fung treats his patients using the Hormonal Theory of Obesity. Essentially, his argument is that weight gain isn't as simple as calories-in vs. calories-out. For most people, our ""body set weight"" is too high (think of this like a thermostat for your body weight).

The body set weight is influenced by interactions between different hormones (leptin, which controls your feeling of satiety, hormone-sensitive lipase, which promotes fat burn, insulin, which promotes fat storage by inhibiting the prior two, and so much more).

The book explains how these different hormones regulate how our body works, and why simple calorie restriction is always, always doomed to fail. As long as your body's resting insulin levels are high, and its insulin resistance is high, your body will always gain the weight back. It's literally programmed to. It's not a matter of will power or personal character.

I won't spoil the conclusions and recommendations at the end of the book. But it was a wild ride. I loved the parts where the book explained the historical and political context surrounding why the government keeps pushing carbs as a healthy thing, why the food pyramid was always absurdly wrong, etc."
keto,"Why do you think you have to eat a lot of calorie dense foods on keto?  If you like eating a lot of volume, eat low carb vegetables with your meals.  You don't eat sticks of butter or something on this diet"
keto,Have you adjusted your calorie intake since your weight loss?
keto,"Yes, I'm a bigger guy - around 200 lbs so I think my carb limit would be around 40 with my level of activity but I try to do zero every day - not counting above ground veggies -of which I eat a ton - the weird gut flora phenomena I've noticed comes from wheat and cane sugar... Probably like how yeast likes white sugar to grow - which I'm sure is candida over growth but it just makes me crave more cookies and ice cream lol"
keto,You might be surprised by how much you can eat when you're not taking in globs of fat. Your meals can basically be meat/eggs/fish + low carb veg + fat to your inclination/taste. But not necessarily low fat.

I have not, however, reintroduced : chips, chocolate, soft drinks, juices and candy.

I dont exercice now (and didnt before or during the diet) and I have not regained a single pound in 2 months!

Let's hope it stays that way..."
keto,Common misconception is that you have to be high on fat. Keto is more about restricting carbs than about fat. Fat just helps with satiety along with protein.
keto,You are clearly a loving and strong person!
keto,Returning to a shitty diet makes you fat again.  Who knew?  Mind blown.

keto,"Yeap, and these people also only did ""keto"" (and usually badly) for a few weeks, stop because they ""aren't losing 10-20lbs a month"" (usually they also have only 10-20lbs to lose) and claim the ""diet"" doesn't work.

Fat adaptation alone takes weeks, and the closer one is to their healthy weight, the longer and harder is going to be to lose that fat weight, so it's really irritating to have people shit on keto when they didn't even bother doing the research."
keto,What a great attitude!  Welcome and if you ever need help just ask!
keto,"I had very similar gains on keto. For the first 7 months I didn't count a single calorie, I just ate until I was full (I got fuller faster over time) and I lost 100lbs. I did have to start doing CICO after a figured out my plateau was actually me in maintenance mode, but I laughed almost every day as the weight fell off. 

This isn't the case for everybody! My fiance and I did keto for about 2 months at the end of last year. I lost 14lbs and she didn't lose a single ounce."
keto,"I‚Äôll let some long term keto users pipe in since they are much more experienced.  
I looked up your macros and you look like all good there. 
I suggest just go like you are, weigh only weekly for a while.  Adjust if you need after a couple weeks.  Redo your macros after 20 ish pounds lost, and again and again as you lose. 
You Will lose weight every week.  But don‚Äôt worry about daily, that‚Äôll drive you crazy.  Look out a couple months, notice how your clothes get looser and looser. 
Think about buying new clothes at Christmas!
But get close to your protein!  Want to lose fat, not muscles. 
Good luck buddy!"

It's also possible that increased muscle mass from all the cycling has prevented a bigger loss on the scales.  This is a lifestyle change and takes time.  It's only been three months it seems like the results are pretty decent.
keto,That would be good because I get that same nasty aftertaste.  It would be nice to be able to tolerate stevia.  Enjoy your taste change.
keto,"Per bread-sized square, they crisp up nicely in the microwave in about 20 to 30 seconds...

I do that to make the nachos. And to crisp up my crust for pizza or cheese bread."
keto,"Give it a month. Ideally, most people lose a bunch of water weight in the first part of ketosis as they shed the carbs and the water that typically holds onto, but it takes a bit for your body to start the fat reduction that comes form your processing fats into energy in ketosis. 

HIIT also builds muscle so you may not see a reduction in weight but have to take into consideration that you‚Äôre building muscle while losing fat and water weight."
keto,"It's not just the water weight.  Glycogen stores in your muscles build back up and store, and thus you have to empty those as well."
keto,Thank you‚ù§
keto,Not one but TWO places right by me have it.  I was baffled
keto,I'm just afraid of falling of the wagon which is why I'm thinking of taking it gradually so that I don't revert back to carbs
keto,"I feel so so tired when I eat carbs. And depressed. And it quickly spirals into an addiction. When I was eating more carbs, I would need a nap every single day. I would be searching on door dash at 10p to see if I could have dessert delivered and if I couldn't, I would go out in search of it. It felt like food controlled my life. I know different things work for different people (ie: my sister is vegan and high carb), but for me, keto was a game changer for me in terms of energy and my relationship with food."
keto,I'm a hyuge fan of Myprotein brand.
keto,"Californian here, too. Never saw this before. Just looked it up, there is a restaurant downtown that serves  it, guess I am not cooking tonight. Thank you!!"
keto,Thank you for your advice‚ù§ I'll consider this
keto,Sounds like a good way to go about it. Did you measure out your carbs to ensure that you were on 100g?
keto,"You really can't get keto hoisin exactly the same but i did this a while ago and it was delicious

 [https://www.myketokitchen.com/keto-recipes/low-carb-hoisin-sauce/](https://www.myketokitchen.com/keto-recipes/low-carb-hoisin-sauce/)"
keto,"I couldn't live without my Keto Pint Sea Salt and Carmel ice cream bar and the end of the day. Aside from that, I find the Keto branded processed stuff too gimmicky. 

Also, I drink a lot of diet soda and had no problem dropping nearly 40 lbs my first go around and I'm dropping weight like crazy currently. It's probably best to ditch diet sodas as well, but it's all about the diet you can stick to and I won't be able to stick to that one."
keto,"So my advice would be it has to be a lifestyle change i don't use the phrase im on a diet,  I lost 40 pounds on keto and I just continued to do the same things after to keep the weight off  make healthier food choices and yes you can have treats but just don't go crazy with it make it fun a healthy life is a wealthy life take care of your wealth you only get one life strong mind and determination always wins"
keto,"I get my protein from steak, chicken, and pork generally. I don't use powders and potions."
keto,"Keto needs to be a LIFESTYLE, not a temporary diet plan, IMHO. And yes, it's very maintainable if you're vigilant. I know there's an inner fat guy in me just waiting to break out if I let him. I don't do cheats and I don't buy trigger foods like nuts, even if they're keto friendly. I simply can't control myself around them. YMMV."
keto,"Yep and that really annoys me.  Plain pasta, white bread, white rice, boiled potatoes, all by themselves are fucking terrible and everyone needs to just admit that.  Wanting a plate full of cheap filler is just caving to habit and addiction."
keto,So how did you deal with the cravings whenever you had them?
keto,If you restrict your carbs for 24-48 hours you are in ketosis.
keto,"I will definitely consider buying a scale, thanks! Not too sure about calorie counting. I will be sure to read up on it though‚ù§"
keto,"YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE WORKING OUT!

Just understand that what happens on the scale might not reflect what is actually happening in your body immediately"
keto,I am in the same situation. I am struggling to get back to my pre Christmas eating life.  Sugar is my addiction.  I am only up 10 lbs but feel miserable. I started keto spring of 2019 and this is the first deviation
keto,"I just wanted to commiserate with you over the chips. Why do they have to be so damn delicious? üòÜ They are my greatest weakness as well.  For me, the chip cravings are really salt and electrolyte cravings, which makes them monster sized during Keto. Ive found a trick-- First I drink some electrolytes. Then I get a spoon of something really salty like  ""Better than Boullion"" or Vegemite.  When the salt has sufficiently puckered my mouth, I find I no longer crave chips. Best of luck Salt Sister!"
keto,I forget the statistics but most people who lose weight that are actually overweight end up gaining it back again. It‚Äôs like &gt;90%. I‚Äôm going on 3 years now and if my old foods didn‚Äôt cause me large amounts Of pain and discomfort due to a food intolerance I discovered I‚Äôd just been living through until keto I likely would have gained it all back again myself.
keto,"I'm using Carb Manager, which just got a really nice functionality and UI update, and its much better than MyFitnessPal, which I'd used on and off for years. It's gear towards keto, instead of the generality of MFP."
keto,"My perception of this experience (that I've lived) is that our fat cells are like water balloons.  When we lose weight, the cells shrink but they are still there and still big like a deflated balloon.  Any time we revert to old ways, our fat cells are all too happy to start inflating again whereas people who have never been fat can cope much better.  


Apparently, and I'm not an expert, it takes years for the actual fat cells to go away.  I've been told intermittent fasting where you go into autophagy will help eliminate fat cells but I don't know how you'd measure that without a whole lab.  


Bottom line, yes, Keto is a lifestyle not a diet.  Especially if you're overweight when you start."
keto,"Great tip!

I was one of those fast food junkies and the kitchen was extremely intimidating to me. I started very, very simple just cooking a meat and a vegetable. I listened to you guys and went and bought like 20 different spices and a bunch of condiments and it really does make all the difference in the world.

I still keep it that simple 99% of the time and I love it! I've found so many great combos that I love that I will literally never run out of keto meal options no matter how long I live!

Do you know any good hoisin sauce recipes?"
keto,"Yes. There are so many good sauces and seasonings out there that you need never lack ""variety"" in your flavors.

Of course, sometimes when people say they want ""variety"" they mean ""starch."""
keto,"No such thing as being kicked out of ketosis while fasting. Fasting, by definition, would mean you consume 0 calories. Without calories, there is nothing to provide enough glucose to stop ketosis (assuming you were in it already).

Chasing ketones though is a distraction that probably isn't worth it.  Prepare to be brutally slammed on that subject in this sub because people here aren't tolerant at all of the concept.  But ultimately, if you have enough anxiety over your ketone levels that it sabotages you efforts, do what you need to do.

Your body should be telling you when you drop out of ketosis though.  Listen to it.

If you really feel you must, a blood sugar meter that also can check for ketones is the closest to useful with breath based device like ketoscan being second yet pretty darned useless and lastly you have pee strips which are beyond useless for anything other than type 1 diabetic monitoring for ketoacidosis risk."
keto,"First of all, be gentle on yourself! You're doing great so far! 8 lbs is a great start! Hormones are a definitely factor so just keep that in mind as your body has changed since baby and nursing. I think you might be eating too often. It's important to try and keep your insulin levels low for longer periods of time. I would stick to just 3 meals to start. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If you're feeling less hungry, go for just two meals - either breakfast and lunch or lunch and dinner. Try to keep about 4-6 hours gap between each meal. Fill your meals with non-starchy veggies (both cooked and raw). As a female, our bodies are more sensitive to fasting. If you're hungry, like truly hungry (not emotional hungry), then you definitely need to eat otherwise it could affect your milk supply."
keto,Sounds exactly like what happened to me in 2019. Started around the end of July at 245 and got all the way down to 207 around Christmas. Decided that Christamas was special enough to cheat and never really regained. Started back the day after Christmas 2020 and it's going really well so far. I learned a lot from the first go and it makes the second go around much easier.
keto,"You need to be careful with all protein powders because they'll be usually cut with a cheap carb to increase volume.  If you're looking for whey stay away from Gainer formulas, Gold Standard is pretty good for since it has only 1g of sugar. I've personally been using grain free Pea Protein powder as I can't consume too much whey at a time."
keto,Should I not be working out first few weeks?
keto,Thanks man. You're amazing!
keto,I've been meaning to try Aldi's ice-cream--I love their snickerdoodle keto cookies.
keto,"Currently two months into my second go and it's been much easier. I remember the first time getting frustrated at stalls, now I just roll on and keep going. I won't make the same mistake I did at the end of the first time and think I can moderate myself."
keto,"Great feedback, thanks! I actually suspected yeast as the cause for a dry spot in my face before, so this seems like a possibility! I‚Äôll look into it."
keto,"I am the same--I try to steer clear of overly processed items. My Kroger finally started carrying Ratio products and I have fell in love with their vanilla, black cherry yogurts. Especially the vanilla it almost tastes like I am eating straight up vanilla icing. hmmm I wonder how well they freeze---I have molds at home gonna give it a whirl sometime.

I tried Mike's hard strawberry lemonade seltzer over the weekend and it was pretty good! I am thinking about making a frozen drink with that maybe add a few strawberries in it.

The grocery stores around me also started carrying Rebel ice-cream which I am glad everyone has had positive things to say about it--I'll buy some after I run out of my Lilly's chocolate peanut butter cups."
keto,I wish I had known that in the first place. I tried so many times and failed because I just felt terrible. I always thought it was electrolytes because that's what everybody says. I'm glad I finally figured it out! üòÅü•≥ü•≥
keto,"I know you included meats but I just want to remind that you shouldn't necessarily be picking lean meats like turkey.  Get beef summer sausage, salami, etc that has significant natural fats in it.  That will help a lot to make the ""snack"" tray feel more filling."
keto,"Breakfast: at the beginning of each week, my husband and I saut√© 2 bell peppers, about half a small onion, and some chopped ham or bacon together and then save it in a container. Then every morning we make scrambled cheesy eggs and throw in a couple spoonfuls of it to provide more flavor. Cheap and delicious (and having the pepper/onion cooked ahead saves time). I also like doing this with mushrooms.

Lunch: every week I buy a rotisserie chicken and take off all the meat to save in the fridge. Then for lunch, I make a quick arugula salad with simple vinaigrette (olive oil, dijon mustard, and champagne vinegar) and throw in some of the chicken, about half an avocado, and a couple other toppings if I have them on hand: cheese, chopped nuts, bell pepper, sometimes a hard-boiled egg. I also love to sprinkle on Trader Joe's Everything Bagel seasoning (which is just sea salt and spices). It's healthy, colorful, and cheap!"
keto,"[https://www.premierprotein.com/products/protein-shakes](https://www.premierprotein.com/products/protein-shakes)

160 calories in an 11 oz shake and they taste good. $30 for an 18 pack at Costco.  I believe Sam's Club sells them as well?

160 may not seem like a lot but 11oz is pretty small so having a couple per day would be feasible.

I'm also a big fan of Keto Chow.  Has a lot of what you need and might otherwise be lacking in a very tasty shake.  It's a little pricey though if you're on a tight budget."
keto,Atta bubs! I‚Äôll follow you along this‚Äô
keto,"Oh I eat ranch and blue cheese with a lot of my meat/veggies. I just try to be mindful of following the portion size. Same with nuts, I‚Äôll have a serving size a day at the most. Still way better to me than grabbing a bag of chips! 

I looooove deviled eggs, too so I‚Äôll whip some up!"
keto,"KETO is not successful as a short term fad diet, same as every other diet you try that works until you go back to your normal eating habits.  No diet will work if you do that.  KETO for me and many others is a life long change in eating and has been the only thing that has ever worked for me long term.  Once again not for everyone."
keto,Keto Pint is the brand on the ice cream bars.  They're great.  Gave one to a non-keto friend and he didn't know they were keto or sugar free until he was finished with it and I told him.
keto,This sounds amazing!
keto,"Yes.  A nutritionist told me that in the world of weight loss, calories in accounts for 80% and exercise counts for 20%.  For people like us, we just always have to watch and that is the way our bodies are."
keto,"&gt; I want to see what actually kicks me out of keto when I am fasting

Fast and don't consume food which is what the word means and nothing is kicking you out of ketosis. Basic misunderstanding of this simple concept means you should not test anything since you don't even understand what you want to test."
keto,"Check out Flock (fried chicken skins) and Good Fish (fried salmon skins), they‚Äôve really helped me with that crunchy craving. Whisps are more of a cracker but also help."
keto,"Yes!  I lost 60 lbs after a whole year of WW.  I was constantly hungry--I mean watching the clock to get to my next snack or meal and the craving for carbs never left me.  Compared to that Keto is almost a breeze, very little hunger and very few cravings.  I made it through the holidays fine.  Although I have been on Keto a short time, 2 1/2 months I can see that it will always be beneficial to me.  And, for the most part, I do not have to weigh or measure.  I am down 20 lb and plan to go down another 30 (or more).  I find looking for copycat Keto recipes helps."
keto,"Shop sales, buy in bulk, and just make what you like.  Pork, dark meat chicken, eggs, all very cheap."
keto,"If you care about ketones get a ketone monitor.  But ask yourself: Why do you care what your ketone level is?  If you eat something and it causes you to gain weight or not feel good, who cares what your ketones are doing?  Stop eating it.

And 99% of the time the stuff you think might throw you out of ketosis SURPRISE does throw you out of ketosis."
keto,Just be careful  with the nuts. A lot of them are pretty calorie dense. You might also add boiled eggs if that's something you don't mind eating. Good protien source. Deviled eggs are fine too if made with mayo and not sugar packed miracle whip. Most tzatziki and ranch are also OK in moderation (just check labels for added sugar) which can make the veggies less boring.
keto,Thanks for being one of the few helpful people who commented on this thread :)
keto,"This is why the scale isn't moving.  You are inflaming your muscles by using them.  This isn't a bad thing, they just hold onto more water.  You're good to go!"
keto,And a happy cake day! üéÇ
keto,"Increase the protein and reduce the fat is always an idea when plateauing, but you‚Äôre just starting I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on. Maybe just stay patient and give it another week or two?  Good luck"
keto,"It is not easy! It takes a lot of planning, but it‚Äôs definitely worth it! The health benefits brought me to veganism, but the ethics/ sustainability definitely keeps me there :)"
keto,I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a difference between eating some carby potatoes vs a box of Oreos too
keto,"Yes, but taking people's advice when related to recipes and what they do, is generally more helpful, imo."
keto,Ah. Semi-lowcarb and veganism sounds like a quite difficult choice but I'm glad it's working out for you so well. I love low carb/keto but I'm conscious of the ethical aspects and am always interested in how people transition to vegetarianism/veganism.
keto,I started the same day as you with a similar routine and same weight goal (hoping to be around 210 when all is said and done). Started at 247 and as of today I‚Äôm 229. I still hate the cravings and I‚Äôm working to find new recipes and foods to eat since I get so sick of eating the same thing all the time. Keep at it! Glad to see we‚Äôre both getting such good results so quickly!
keto,I can‚Äôt comment on which is better but there are several that do both. Freestyle is one I use for blood glucose but it also measure ketones with different strips.
keto,Started with keto! Also doing some weighted glute exercises on days I don‚Äôt do hiit.
keto,Leaning into high fat foods always helps me get over the hump of first week keto. Scaling it back and focusing on more protein after that is a great plan.
keto,"That's fine, to each their own. But no diet will ever be successful if you are so quick to give up. Best of luck."
keto,1900 is an appropriate amount for a breastfeeding women. You have to take that into account
keto,"Ahhhh I see! I‚Äôll have to look into the fat bombs and get creative. I have a bento box so I think I‚Äôm going to start making small ‚Äúcharcuterie‚Äù type meals for lunch with meats, cheeses, nuts, and veggies and cut back on the quest/Atkins bars"

keto,Neither.
keto,"I had a really bad reaction to hormonal birth control in 2019, so I pursued the route to limit my exposure to excess hormones. I do try to limit my net carbs to under 50, as well, but overall a vegan diet has helped my anxiety, helped me build muscle, increase my endurance etc. I did have some skin reactions incorporating carbs back into my diet, almost like a very mild allergic reaction. That didn‚Äôt last a long time though, but still happens somewhat if I overdo it with sugar."
keto,The study says what it says.  You can draw your own conclusions. I just want people to be informed.
keto,"I actually get this in the same spot when I switch to keto as the sugar/yeast in my system puts out a last call to ""arms"" and gives me yeast rashes. Last time it happened, I had it my doc send it to the lab to see if it was bacterial or what, and was surprised it is yeast. As you continue to cut sugar, it should go away, or you can try an anti fungal cream to see if it responds."
keto,I see you've got your answers so I'm just gonna pop in to mention... add some parmesan to your pork rinds if you want a different flavor. Works well on chicken and pork especially!
keto,"It seems like cheese, cream cheese, or just straight cream is in just about every keto recipe I find. I have probably eaten more cheese in the past year than I have in the 10 that came before it. So uh, does anyone have any experience with keto-related-constipation? And if so any recommended cures?"
keto,‚ÄúThe damage seen was transient‚Äù says the study of 9 healthy men.
keto,"12 kg = 27 lbs lost. Amazing job, keep it up.


If you are staying strict at average 1800 calories a day, you will lose weight. It's a mathematical certainty.


I'm not worried about your macros at all. I would like to dispel the misnomer that not eating enough stops weight loss. All eating more will do is decrease your calorie deficit. Your body will burn the body fat it needs to function. 


With that said, at similar weight I did keto at 1650 calories/day. There's no harm in lowering them a little to spurn weight loss.


Also keep in mind, the human body is a bank account, but it likes to hold debt. That means it's normal to have a deficit for a couple weeks without weight loss, then it magically wooshes away.


Generally drinking more water is helpful. Id suggest trying to get around 150 Oz of water today (coffee or other drinks don't count towards this total). This can help.


Also, if you want to try to force a woosh, doing a 24 hour water fast (no food, only drink water) wont hurt you and could work. There are people who do alternative day fasting as a lifestyle, so rest assured its not unsafe to do once.


Finally, maybe try a HIIT workout routine for a couple weeks (Google) to spice up your workouts.


Best of luck. Would love to see an update in 40 days with what you did, how it worked, and lessons learned!"

keto,"Never had an issue even when ultra low carb for an extended period (less than 10g a day for 2 months). 

I do know from experience when my wife was very ill and not eating well a few years ago that hair loss can be stopped or reversed by taking a mix of collagen, vitamin D3, biotin and vitamin C. The vitamin C helps improve the absorption and effectiveness of the collagen."

keto,"Track (calorie counting + scale).


Also an idea that worked for me is to make a bet with a close friend or extended family member. If you don't lose x weight by y date, you need to give them as a gift x amount of money. The amount should be a dollar amount that doesn't make you homeless, but puts meaningful financial stress on your life. If possible have them hold it in escrow.  


If you accomplish your goal the reward is you get to keep your money. Enjoy! They need to 100% be on board with tough love and hold you to it though.


For reference I lost 50 lbs in 20 weeks with the ""bet"" method. I ended up doing keto for the first half, but then couldn't work out due to injury and fell behind my pace (23 lbs in 12 weeks of keto) so I had to psmf for the last 63 days to hit my goal.  If planning to do keto, maybe 1.5-2 lbs/week is a realistic max pace."

keto,"So, I started keto in December 2019. At first, I was pretty hardcore about it and started to see results immediately, as almost everyone that's done it can attest. Pretty quickly, though, I realized that if I treated as a ""diet"" that I was going to win a few battles but overall lose the war. The reframing that happened for me was this: *I'm not on a diet. I've changed the way I eat.*

I'm still only down about 20 lbs total, and I have a long-term goal of another 20, but I don't stress about my carb count on a meal by meal basis. I've just made an adjustment in my diet AND in my shopping, which for me is key. If it's not in the house, I can't go grab the quick carb food. Keto purists would say I'm not doing it right. All I know is that I'm down 20 lbs, eating the best foods in my life, and getting healthier with each pound I drop. I'm calling that a win."

keto,"Nice problem to have! I suggest: 

- avocados
- fatty meats like ribeye, or king salmon
- chicharr√≥n (I eat it with lime juice, salt and cholula sauce, but could go well with mayonnaise for even more calories)
- macadamia nuts
- certain salad dressings (ranch with zero carb for example)
- peanut butter
- cook stuff with extra butter, even your vegetables (sauteed spinach with salt and minced shallots is delicious), for more calories in your portions. 

Good luck!"

It's the price of food and the effort of having to cook it while a full time student and full time employee.

keto,You‚Äôre gaining weight because you‚Äôre gaining water (bloating).  Water is very heavy and the scale can‚Äôt tell the difference between water and fat.  I can gain 4-5 pounds overnight when I get my period just from water retention.  Even though I know I didn‚Äôt gain fat it still drives me crazy so I don‚Äôt weigh myself until it‚Äôs over.
keto,Waiting until after super bowl. Last time I was down to 280 in like 4-5 months on lazy keto. Thanksgiving and Christmas made it hard to get back on track.
keto,Mine was at Walmart. I think it was $6.98.
keto,Where did you pick yours up? Someone else suggested that brand and it seems it is available in some grocery stores which is a big plus on my book!
keto,I do not. Pink salt has all those minerals in them. I put 1/2 tsp in hot water and add that  to 1500ml or 32ounces of ice water with a lemon slice.
keto,Thats very good to know thank you. I seldom drink but seeing as the lockdown has lessened felt like grabbing a bottle of whiskey and having a double(or few) over the weekend :)
keto,I didn‚Äôt know mio could be used. Stur water enhancers? I‚Äôll try that. Thanks. I really wanna start. I‚Äôm also trying to find other breakfast stuff to use bc ive been having a meat aversion lately. Thx so much
keto,"That's good news, thank you!"
keto,"I have been training gymnastics strength training for about 5 years but smoked weed for over 10 and with my experience I have to say that I have to eat alot more to maintain myself. As far as strength, weight ect.  Almost if you couldn't shift into your last 2 gears.  Higher rpms more fuel.  It feels as if I burn fat twice as fast.  If I smoke too much I go underweight and develope anxiety.  So in my opinion I would believe that statement that it can help you loose weight."
keto,I picked up those mio and stur water enhancers from the grocery stores. Then I add about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp salt to my flavored water and its been working great! There's a lot of options. And you can go pick up half salts which have potassium and sodium chloride. Lately I've just been using my pink himalayan salt on hand. Drink these all the time and I find it helps a lot

Thanks mate! I tried the Keto pizza at Blaze and it was ok. I mean, I ate it like there was no tomorrow, but it wasn't anywhere close to the real thing. I like this Ketoconnect website. Thanks for sharing!"

keto,Doea pink himalayan has enough pitassium perhaps??
keto,Balanced diet? So I'm guessing this doctor would be against a plant based diet too?
keto,I personally make the chicken crust pizza from ketoconnect.net all the time and it's incredible! You can also find a lot of fathead pizza dough recipes online or Cauliflower crust options to make too. Wishing you the best for continued successes!
keto,Exactly. Just gotta keep it simple sometimes.
keto,Heavy cream is about 0.4g net carb per serving. Listing 1g per serving is more down to labeling regulations than actual carb content.
keto,"Just yesterday my doctor told me Keto isn't healthy long term 6 months to a year max. 

I asked why, she said you need a balanced diet and it's not sustainable.

Soooo, I guess we need potatoes, bread and rice to exist on this earth...lmao

I think I need a new doctor since I love my meat, cheese, nuts and veggies."
keto,My wife became a lot softer! The same
keto,Amazing weight loss! Incredible dedication.
keto,Have you given up yet?
keto,"I understand where you're coming from but since I posted this, people have helped me realize that as long as you don't exceed your carb limit, you're still on keto"
keto,Ohhhhhh lets hope that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on! I‚Äôve heard of the flush effect but never heard about the fat being softer. Fingers crossed
keto,I read here about the flush effect? The fat gets less hard more puffy and only then moves to be burnt? Not sure though but i m in the same boat.
keto,"Yes, but anyone who works out frequently has more than everyone else, so they burn more calories while doing nothing. I suppose the calculators take that into account. Working out is not even necessary, actually. Bicycling, walking, running."
keto,"More electrolytes and a keto ade may not be enough.  I did like a half teaspoon of salt and 16oz of water a half hour before a fasted workout and that always did the trick.  Also you're still new to keto, it takes a bit.  ease into the exercise"
keto,"What is your height, weight, age, and sex?"
keto,"Is love to eat some, but, how is that different than adding fiber to ice cream and calling it good? I mean, they're adding fiber to white flour and telling us all is well. Loving carbs is what got us here in the first place, right?"
keto,So does that fit your carb limit?
keto,Thank you! I did this and still couldn't drink water until I had the salt in my mouth! That's crazy how well this worked! You're amazing üëè

keto,That's fair! Ill look into that too
keto,"Thank you so much for your comment! It makes me feel better.üòä It's nice to be reminded this is all for the sake of getting better, not just losing weight. I don't have peppermint,  but sage tea helped. I'll have to go shopping."
keto,"You don't have to give up your chicken breast, they're my favorite as well. Just be sure when you cook them, to finish them off with some fats after cooking. It will make up for the meat itself being lean."
keto,"The testing strips are not helpful. If you're limiting carbs to fewer than 20 g net then you are in ketosis. But that being said, ketosis does not mean weight loss. To help you we need to know your stats and calorie intake."
keto,Follow the electrolyte guidelines. You need more sodium for exercise.
keto,"I'm STARVING all the time, which I wasn't ever hungry on keto, even after fasting for 48 hours. But I'm running like 10 miles/week and lifting weights 4 hours a week. I did super well on my chicken breasts and veggies diet for a long time but I think it is time for me to graduate to eating more fat haha. 

Good call on the spinach, I definitely do sometimes, Palak paneer is like my favourite food on the planet, but maybe I can take out some of my regular meal veggies and replace them with spinach in my smoothie!"
keto,"&gt; 177 to 173 

&gt; 1900 calories

&gt; not the greatest at tracking though

Your initial results are great but these things might need to be addressed namely that that may be slightly too many calories and you likely to be better at tracking."
keto,If you're eating in a deficit then you're likely to go less often and few of the foods you mention need to be excreted (read: they are entirely digested in the small intestine).
keto,"It works but it doesn‚Äôt really taste the same, Johannisbrotkernmehl is pretty neutral and quite refined, it‚Äôs a hard find tho and a bit expensive, but you don‚Äôt really need more than one teaspoon for an entire pot"
keto,"A lot of people don‚Äôt end up going back because of the mood benefits alone. We start out trying to lose weight, but stay because life is just that much easier when you have virtually endless source of energy."
keto,"Ha. Before keto was even a thing (I‚Äôm 41 now), 15 years ago I lost a lot of weight and added muscle just doing a chicken breast and broccoli diet (plus protein shakes) for two months. So, I think you‚Äôre on the perfect track, as is. But, if you absolutely need calories, then it seems like those are some good options to go to.... and I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd have to give up the chicken and veggies. You could also try swapping some different veggies. Spinach, for example, has much fewer net carbs than even broccoli or cauliflower. Maybe switch in some broccoli rabe, which has fewer too, from what I recall. Either way, good luck!"
keto,"They measure excess ketones which can circulate for some time even when not in ketosis. So when you first start, a positive is usually a true positive. But, when people attempt to eat foods then test the urine they cannot be used to monitor nutritional ketosis because if you are out of ketosis then you will excrete ketones produced earlier that still need to excreted. And, with time, most people stop producing excess ketones so the tests will become negative even when in ketosis. 

They are intended to be sensitive to detect ketoacidosis which involves a significant increase in serum ketones far beyond physiological levels with consistent spillage in the urine."
keto,"I impulse bought one called Wonderworks Keto Friendly Cereal in the peanut butter flavor and loved it!  14g carb, 3g fiber and 4g sugar alcohol. 7g net for one cup."
keto,man that stuff sounds good and I didn't even understand half of it.
keto,"Wow, that just sounds bad, good luck to you too! 

I always wanted to do the fasting part, but I always wanted to ask, do you still drink water? 
When I fast in Ramadan, it's no food or drink, so idk. It's easy but it's only for about 15 hours, nowhere NEAR 72!"
keto,It's 4 gram net carbs.
keto,"They aren‚Äôt just adding fiber in to lower the net carbs, as that isn‚Äôt how net carbs work. 

Yea, there is wheat flour in them, but the amount needed is reduced because some of the fiber in it is serving that role.

Edit:  I would recommend reading this post I made a while back, as it explains what net carbs actually means. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/ba5j9k/can_you_explain_the_carbs_in_this/ek9gefl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3"
keto,"No, it's not the same. What are the net carbs? Count them in your macros."
keto,I try to go weekdays instead of weekends and can usually find it. I buy four loaves at a time and freeze so it‚Äôs always on hand.
keto,"They are frequency questionnaires where they ask what you ate for breakfast last month, and are pretty far from real science.  There have been repeated trials where they add fruit and vegetables to poor peoples' diets and nothing improves.  Vegetables are nice if you like them but they don't prevent cancer.  That's pretty silly on its face.  If anything they just displace foods that do cause cancer like highly processed nonsense, seed oils, etc."
keto,Everyone has muscle mass.
keto,"That sounds almost like my success back in 2018.. I started July 1 at 350, and tracked it until July of 2019 and I had lost 110 pounds also. I lost half of it in the first 100 days, then the other have over the remainder of the year.   
I didn't think to take before/after pics because I am not really a ""selfie"" type person."
keto,"You already did start. Right now. 

Have fun, and take pics along the way! You can do it!"
keto,It‚Äôs a great feeling when random people notice. I have been buying my jeans from the same local shop for 5+ years. Now mind you I only go in two or three times a year but always have a nice conversation with the sales clerk who seems to remember me. It had been 3 months since my last visit and I‚Äôm probably 40 pounds down from that time. When I walked in this weekend her reaction was ‚ÄúOMG look how skinny you‚Äôve got!‚Äù  I don‚Äôt like the attention but it did feel good!

keto,"People that eat a lot of fruits and vegetables are otherwise healthy people.  This is called a healthy user bias.  They also smoke less, drink less alcohol, and tend to exercise more and get more time outside.  These are associations. They are absolutely not causative in any way whatsoever."
keto,"Because when you no longer have the body fat on you to fuel yourself then you must eat adequate fat or you won't have anything in or on your body to fuel yourself.
Whilst trying to loose weight large amounts of fat is counter productive because you want to be using your stored body fat as fuel."
keto,It comes from ketogenic diets used to control seiuzres.
keto,"Avocados are a great idea too! I'm pretty set on the 5 servings of veggies after seeing how much better I feel and after seeing a study on the effects of vegetable consumption on cancer risk that I linked in another comment. I'm going to definitely start adding more avocado and maybe more macadamia nuts and such as well. I'm generally well over my protein goal, just need to add more fat. 

And I suppose everyone is right that I'll have to switch out my chicken breast for meat with fat in it :( I just love chicken breast so much haha"
keto,"No. Meet or exceed protein goal, keep carbs under 20 and fat is for satiety only, fine to have body weight sub in. Also fine to eat the fat that comes with fatty meat, eggs, fish, avocado, olives, etc. No need for drinking oil in coffee, etc, esp if trying to lose weight. Ketogenic diets extremely high in added fat are to control seizures, not to lose weight. 

And OMAD is not required to be successful with keto. Some find it stalls them or they cannot eat sufficient protein, etc. Some feel it mimic a binge cycle and is triggering. Everyione is different.

[https://thefastingmethod.com/omad-should-you-eat-one-meal-a-day/](https://thefastingmethod.com/omad-should-you-eat-one-meal-a-day/)

OMAD works for some and is great for maintenence. I personally found I lost best with two meals a day (TMAD) and some IF. So mix it up and if you do not see the results you want, try something else."

I learned the sodium last night after vomiting from what I assume was keto flu low sodium levels for the first time since I started! It sucked for sure and I am now back to being responsible after not having been for a long time."
keto,We disagree about that. Here is a study that proves that those that eat 5 servings of vegetables a day have a significantly reduced cancer risk. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468967/ it's non-negotiable for me.
keto,Awesome job! You got this!
keto,"Maybe try switching out one or two of those veggie servings with mixed nuts. Theyre a really high calorie option for the amount of carbs they have. Just half a cup of mixed nuts will give you almost 400 calories by itself. Same goes for avocado, if you‚Äôre not already eating some. Try half an avocado with lite Italian dressing.. it‚Äôs great and very few net carbs. You could also just add a few more slices of cheese to what you‚Äôre already eating. No carb protein shakes are also 100 calories per scoop (and two scoops in a single 8-12 oz serving is easy)."
keto,"First I would try to figure out what your deficet is, that way you have an idea of how much more cals you need. Then I would definitely start eating fattier cuts of meat, try adding some good oils to your food after they're cooked, butter and heavy cream to your coffee...etc Also, since you're training pretty heavy, I'd make sure to increase my sodium as well. Hope you get it figured out, and see the success you want!"

keto,"I am studying the matter of carbohydrates, Insulin, obesity, diabetes, etc for a project and for what I know right now carbohydrates play a huge role in all of this, for example here there is two insulin vicious cycle :

When the glucose levels in the blood are below a certain point hunger comes, then the people eats and if he eats carbohydrates there is a peak of glucose levels and consequently a peak of insulin levels, this means two things, first the rampage of insulin blocks most of the leptin going to the brain to cause satiaton so you eat MORE, second if the people has some degree of insulin-resistance (which is not rare) more insulin than needed will be released making glucose in the blood falling to much to early so you eat MORE FREQUENTLY. 

When the insulin levels are low the adipose tissue release free fatty acids (FFAs) into the blood to help the body in situations of starving, but if the adipose tissue has some degree of insulin-resistance it will release FFAs even when insulin levels are normal, in response the pancreas secrete more insulin to store the fat somewhere what only makes the adipose tissue more resistant to insulin what makes the adipose tissue release even more FFAs and so on. All of this while the liver is full of fat of sugar due to a sedentary lifestyle, hight carbohydrate ingestion, etc and taking a lot of the fat that the adipose tissue released earlier, this often creates NAFLD that with time develops into NASH ( fibrosis, inflammation, cellular damage, etc) and when the damage is irreparable it becomes Cirrhocis. 

And this is facts, this is not something that said 1 study but lots, so I don't know ho healthy it may be in the long-term but as a break to the body to heal, remove excessive fat, stabilize glucose levels and reset insulin-resistance it is the best."
keto,Spoon or sliced Daikon radish.
keto,"This will be my last response as I can't waste any more time on your wrongness...

What do you think would happen if your son injected enough insulin to lower his blood sugar sufficiently that his liver had to start releasing its glycogen stores, which when depleted ultimately cause ketosis?

keto,Day 5 is still early for some people.  It really depends on how much glycogen you have stored to burn off.
keto,"You need to find out how many calories to consume daily. This will depend on some factors such as your present weight and gender. 1600 is about the minimum. From there, determine your macros, carbs, protein, and fat. Google ketogenic diet to give you the percentages for each. Let's say hypothetically you are going to eat 10% carb, 25% protein, and 65% fat. That means to stay in your macros, you can eat about 40 grams of carbs, 100 grams of protein, and 140 grams of fat. You can use an app to calculate the nutritional content of your food. Pay pal is a good one. You imput the weight and what food it is and the app will do all the calculations for you. You can also buy scales that you input a code and it will tell you how many of each macro the food contains."

keto,You might be right. But my small portion of octopus last night had 10g carbs. So it can be hard for someone staying under 20g a day to incorporate some of these shellfish. But just wanted to give other shellfish lovers a heads up :)
keto,If it fits your macros
keto,"It is not necessary, but can definitely help you get into ketosis."
keto,What did I do wrong posting a question about shakes? I guess shakes are not part of keto? Could you have told me that instead of remove my like first or second post on here?
keto,"You are throwing a fit because you didnt like their post. Anything beyond simply scrolling past and going on about your day, is overreacting."

keto,How am I overreacting?
keto,"How was I overreacting? Brought up some logout points about low effort postings. I care because I've been reading and posting on this subreddit for years and as of late lots of there omg I went over .0006 grams of carbs am I gonna die posts seem to be happening.

And low and behold did you know sea food contains carbs, well duh, so does veggies. Just making an observation"
keto,Wasn't a fan of quest although I will give them another try. Blaze while pricey is a great option. Lou malantih's sausage crust is way better though and just as pricey.
keto,Appreciate the advice. You're right. Being so close to the goal is making me have some serious tunnel vision.
keto,"Make sure you read the FAQ, it has all kinds of good answers in there: [https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq)

Net carbs generally = total carbs - fiber."
keto,"Well, that‚Äôs the great thing about it. They don‚Äôt have to exist in your world. There are lots of places that are that way for me. They‚Äôre just not even on my radar. Applebee‚Äôs barely is, but if I‚Äôve been driving for several hours and want to sit down and eat a meal to take a break before getting back on the road, I‚Äôll hit Applebee‚Äôs or Ruby Tuesday because the atmosphere will be decent, and the food will be predictable. I can be in and out of one of those in the same amount of time as a typical Interstate exit fast food joint, and I don‚Äôt have to spend most of it standing in line, stepping aside to wait, go over to the fountain to get my own sticky lid out of the dispenser, and watching my fries slowly wilt on the counter while they remake my burger without onions. It‚Äôs only going to cost a little more, and it‚Äôs going to be a lot better."
keto,I like how you are telling people not to overreact while overreacting yourself.
keto,"yep. I am getting back into keto now, and last time I had a carb heavy meal I practically fell alseep in my chair, and the next day I was dragging so much ass.   
On keto, I had so much energy, I could feel well rested with like 5 hours of sleep, and I would just spontaneously wake up before my alarm and be ready to hit the bricks."
keto,Rubs and spices of all kinds have carbs. Garlic and onion powder being main offenders for me and my lifestyle anyway
keto,"You will find many discussions of this if you use the search bar. Some are fine with them, some who test find that they are an issue for their body. If you are in the latter camp, avoid. I am and I do. Eating ""lc"" tortillas kicked me out of ketosis and I had a flare of a condition, HS, that keto otherwise controls. So I do lettuce wraps or make flax or coconut wraps occasionally at home. Whatever I wanted to eat is always good in a bowl. 

Common foods associated with stalls are keto processed foods (you are not alone), nuts and cheese. If you are not happy with your progress, sticking to unprocessed one ingredient whole foods may help.l"
keto,This happened to me too! About as many months in as her too. Is she drinking significantly less alcohol?

keto,"I got that craving on Keto - I started having a pot of sugar free jelly after dinner which really curbed those cravings. 

I‚Äôm UK based and the Hartley‚Äôs jelly‚Äôs are the best ones. About 1.5G carbs and about 5 KCAL per pot."
keto,"Is she getting a minimum of 5000mg sodium, 1000-3000mg potassium and 400mg magnesium per day and accounting for extra water consumed or otherwise sweating those electrolytes out?

keto,My go to is an iced blonde americano with cream. You could add your own stevia/monkfruit/choice of sweetener or a shot or two of their sf syrups but I just love the flavor of the blonde on its own.

keto,"i'm the only one doing keto in my house too. I got a lot of pressure about it for a long time. it's not a perfect analogy but i wonder if folks who say ""one [cookie} won't hurt"" would say ""one cigarette won't hurt"" to an ex-smoker? 

As far as staying strong, i've found it helpful to have my favorite keto snacks stashed away when i'm tempted by carby stuff. For me that's things like hardboiled egg yolks and kale chips."

Keto granola and yoghurt 
Tuna and cucumber with a bit of Mayo
Steak and two eggs for dinner 

I‚Äôm not that active, so that‚Äôs enough for me usually. But it really depends on your weight, height, activity level etc. You‚Äôll probably need to track your macros for a while until you‚Äôre in a safe and healthy routine. But hope those examples help :)"
keto,"Incredible!! Keep up the good work.

That‚Äôs how I felt. I loved crap food and overeating. Keto was just the best form of control for me. Glad to hear you‚Äôre doing so well :)"
keto,"That‚Äôs incredible, amazing job. 

I was just obese, and the moment I went keto, everyone started lecturing me saying it was healthy. Despite loosing 45 lbs. But no one blinked an eye when I was eating an entire bag of Doritos and cookies for breakfast. 

Keep up the amazing work. Glad to hear it‚Äôs had such a positive impact on your lifestyle."

keto,"How did you first discover keto?

By happy accident, I began practicing the keto lifestyle back in 2014 ‚Äì even before the word ‚Äúketo‚Äù was the buzzword it is today. I was at the time, 75+ lbs overweight, and feeling very unwell.

My chest felt tight all the time and I couldn‚Äôt breathe properly. Fearing a heart attack, I went for a complete health screening. The good news was that I did not have heart disease. The bad news was that I had Diabetes Type 2.

The doctor immediately put me on¬†Janumet¬†and told me that if I didn‚Äôt find a way to lose the extra weight, I would very likely end up with a host of other serious health issues as a result of diabetes. Ultimately, this would be the catalyst to how I discovered the Keto Path.If you or you are looking to achieve success like many of your predecessors, then it's simple and easy to visit our website

keto,"I‚Äôm about 2 weeks into keto, 8lbs down. Feeling irritated that I drank a Red Bull without even thinking about it! Usually the energy drinks I drink (rarely) have been sugar free. I realized it about 3 hours later. Hopefully I don‚Äôt gain back half of what was lost. Anyone else had a total brain fart like this?! How bad were the consequences for you?"
keto,"This is all *keto* things related only. Please do not try to sell other 'tonics' on here. Besides, it's clearly unlikely that it works."

keto,Well done!!! We got this üòÖ PS Totti is one of my favourite players ever
keto,"I've been doing keto for 5 years off and on and I'm guessing you're just close to the ""difficult pounds"". I call them that, they are the ones near your most likely lowest practical weight. I haven't any evidence of this theory, but I know that when I get near 185 it's hard as hell to get to 180. I'm a 6' male in his 50s. I've plateaued for months at that 185 number. Don't be discouraged, keto is good for your general health, so you're doing the right thing and eventually you will hit your goal! Have you tried intermittent fasting? Many have said it gets them past their plateaus. 

Good luck and hang in there!"
keto,"This is so true. Even if they aren‚Äôt jealous they are just confronted by the change. My dad once said to me that if I lost any more weight I‚Äôd fade away and be unhealthy! And I reminded him that my healthy older sister was 5cm taller than me and weighed at least 5kg‚Äôs less than I did, so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd be perfectly fine. He was actually shocked to hear that information. He had a picture of us both in his head, and because I‚Äôd deviated some far from mine he noticed the difference when what he was trying to warn me against already existed in my sister and everything was fine."
keto,"Hey, are you me? These are, and I'm not kidding, my exact numbers for that exact period of time. I'm 6' and 54yo.  

Good for us! I'm shooting for 180, but it's very difficult to maintain. I'm hoping to get there and move to a more or less low carb diet ala South Beach. I feel that's more sustainable than keto. Although I've kept keto for 2 years straight back in 2016/17.  We'll see. Good luck frendo!"
keto,"Anecdotally, yes this is true. Strength goes down initially. And then returns and endurance will increase."
keto,"Everyone else has made some good points, but I‚Äôll still add mine! My partner is generally pretty happy to do low carb with me, but not always. Like we don‚Äôt keep bread in the house and we‚Äôll always pick zucchini noodles over pasta. But tonight we were feeling lazy so we just got some bread rolls, salad, and a roast chicken. I had the salad and roast chicken in a bowl while he made his sandwich. I did feel slightly jealous, but what I did, and I suggest you do, is focus on making your meal a little bit * extra *. Maybe is a little salt of seasoning? Perhaps it‚Äôs some tasty melted butter or mayo? Maybe it‚Äôs an addition of cheese? There are heaps of small ways to up your meal with tiny additions. So when you‚Äôll feeling left out, try to make it extra! 

Also if your fam loves baking, perhaps this is the perfect time to investigate some keto baking recipes? You can investigate the recipes together, go shopping for the alternative ingredients, and make it together. Share something of yourself with them. I don‚Äôt mean every day as you still need to be careful with keto treats. But every now and then it might be nice!"
keto,"Thanks person! I've done this before, but it was a bit easier due to pandemic lockdowns. I quit drinking also, at least for January, but we'll see... I'm not a hard core drinker, but I'm finding joy in life without the booze, so that's nice."
keto,"I eat lots of fermented veg, my girlfriend is polish and we go to the polish shops in my town and I buy my fermented veg from there very cheap and it's delicious."
keto,Protein shake could work too if you come to a point when you need a break from eggs. Make it with water or almond milk and you can also add it to your coffee.
keto,Maybe you should also ask your question in r/ketoscience
keto,"If you‚Äôve just started this week, first thing you need to do is read the FAQ in the about section of this sub it will answer most if not all of your questions. It is LONG but has heaps of essential information. 

One of the first things it will ask you to do if calculate your macros at this site: https://calculo.io/keto-calculator.

You‚Äôve asked how many carbs do you need to be strict keto. The quick answer is 20g net (carbs - dietary fiber. Keep in mind if you‚Äôre in places like Australia packet food will already have net carbs, places like the US don‚Äôt). The longer answer is that everyone is different but that 20g will work for pretty much everyone. Some people can still maintain keto at 50g and others will drop out at 21g. 

The 7lbs you‚Äôve lost this week is mostly water weight. It is entirely normal and expected to loose big the first weight because of this, however don‚Äôt expect to loose this every week and get discouraged if you don‚Äôt. Weight loss isn‚Äôt linear, some weeks you‚Äôll loose 5lbs and others you might not loose any. On average it‚Äôs recommended to see a ~2lbs weight loss per week - 10 days."
keto,"I'm busy and I meal prep since day 1! Gather some ideas what you want to eat for the next week and cook on the weekend. I plan Monday - Friday, cook on Sunday and go grocery shopping on Saturday. Works for me. ;)

My meals are usually meat with veggies (mostly roasted, but sometimes a salad). I try to prepare more than 1 veggie side, as to not get bored. Or one big pot meals, like cabbage with minced meat. 

Food on the weekends is bacon and eggs and whatever else I'm cooking. 

You don't really need a meal plan IMHO. Just calculate your macros and pay attention to what you need to eat to achieve these macros (and how much). Don't beat yourself up if it doesn't work perfectly in the beginning - it's a learning process."
keto,Awww so awesome! You look great :)
keto,"Damn, son!"
keto,Excellent progress.  Goal weight by summer if your body keeps cooperating!
keto,"That's really funny you say ""60 lbs""...because that is roughly what I've lost between September when I started, and now (304 to 248). I will say though that my eating habits have become a bit more nuanced after my first big drop- I started deep diving into keto baking, and Costco alternatives to things I miss (tortillas, ice cream bars, pasta) have become a godsend."

keto,Hahaha yes. I guess that‚Äôs one way to do it. I think I will do that for now. Did it work for you? I‚Äôm looking to lose about 60lbs.

keto,"So, the guy who recommended strain to me said no CBD.  Apparently it can have a similar effect as caffeine.  It's good for muscle relax he said, but it will light up your brain more often than not.

It was  indica, but he also mentioned two terpenes it was high in.  I forget which, but you could prob research.  Maybe even if not indica a low cbd high in those terpines could help in small enough dose.

Smaller dose was important, large dose just sent me spinning.

Sorry I can't be more helpful, it was all that worked for me though and I had it rough for awhile."
keto,"What kind of dose do you take? Also for the dose, if it's net elemental magnesium amount or the whole powder"
keto,"Am taking CBD, it is very mild though. Normal one gives me brain zaps and lazyness during the day. Also it's almost impossible to get far indica where I'm at, all other types make me anxious and awake"
keto,"And I keep keto healthy snacks around for during work like cheese sticks, nuts, etc"
keto,"Not as physically demanding but I work in medical imaging in a hospital emergency room, by myself overnight with one other person to help moving semi- or un- conscious 200, 300, 400 lb patients on and off of my table and pushing beds and stretchers, getting like 14k steps per shift. I worried about the lack of carbs and energy at first but I've done fine, I actually feel like I have more consistent energy and if I start to feel a little wonky I just eat a salt packet üòÜ"
keto,Weed.
keto,I completely understand this feeling and I am so happy for you!!
keto,"Okay, that wasn't detailed.  Seems opposite of some accounts I've read here with regards to keto and sleep, i.e. people need less sleep and wake up earlier and feel rested and have energy for the day.

Maye some magnesium would help?"
keto,"Thank you.

I am actually on keto for 2 years now, but I know it's far from perfect, for one - lately I do cheat every weekend, and sometimes even twice a week. Also, after testing more with glucose blood meter I found that some things I eat actually raise glucose by 10-20 points, which is not ideal I imagine, compared to other foods that move it 5 or less on average.

Also, I see 500 mg of magnesium referred in FAQ. I wonder if it's the raw material of 500, or the elemental magnesium (which is usually around 15%)"
keto,"Thank you. And yes I know what ur talking about.
I was always super skinny growing up....well until my 20' and early 30's. Lol

I think it's just different for everyone. Genetics has a huge factor. 
Personally after losing this amount of weight yes I do have that issue. What i'm focusing on now is weight training. Heavy lifting. Trying to fill that now empty space with muscle. Lol
I am by no means any sort of expert. I'm just a guy who has been reading as much as possible and thru trial and error figured out what works.
I think it's just a feeling, you'll know it."
keto,"Because it's not restful actually. After some time (regardless if I'm in bed or not) I start to feel cortisol kick in, which makes me feel like hangovered, and then as the day goes I feel worse and worse.

Also my exercise performance drops by 30-40%  


I do need 7.5 hours to feel normal, anything less is like I a hangover"
keto,"Yes! This isn't talked about enough. It might be something referred to as ""tired but wired,"" especially if you're just getting fat adapted. I'd make sure to get your magnesium as it's important and also helps with sleep.

But really, you just have to wait it out. It doesn't last too long. Your body is just learning how to utilize a new fuel source and it LOVES it. It's awful üòÇ"
keto,"Way to go!  I grew up in Texas but live in Oregon and there is no good Tex-Mex up here!  I‚Äôve often thought that I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt live in Texas because it would be way too tempting to pass on the Margaritas, fresh tortillas  and Chips and Queso. I‚Äôm proud of you!"

keto,üôèüèΩüòä
keto,"I don‚Äôt have an answer to your plateau question but came here to say that I did the same thing for two months when i first started and it was the absolute best decision. I focused on the process and not the results which in turn caused me to create some really great habits. 

It was a lovely surprise to step on the scale after 2 months and see i was down over 20 lbs. Who knows? Maybe i had been at that number for a couple of weeks? Didn‚Äôt matter because that progress was still great and I‚Äôve continued to lose since. 

I weigh myself more frequently now because I have a specific number in mind that I‚Äôd like to hit before my wedding next week but after that, I‚Äôm going back to not weighing myself for a while."
keto,I would also recommend following the advice of your dr. But also do your own research. I just seen my dr today and we were talking about the benefits of a ketogenic diet for people of all ages. I am very thankful that my medical team are all huge supporters of the keto lifestyle. There is a book called Keto. It‚Äôs the best I‚Äôve read so far. Check it out üòä
keto,"Nice work. You are about 25 days behind me. M35, 5‚Äô10‚Äù, Sw 230. GW 185. Last Sunday I was at 214.5. Only weighing myself weekly (tomorrow) so we will see where I‚Äôm at.

Most importantly is the no booze. Hitting 30‚Äôdays (like right this moment). I‚Äôm feeling great as I was hitting the sauce really hard for about 3 months. Also a KC native and huge Chiefs fan... so I‚Äôve had to combat multiple play off parties and lots of booze around. But Trust me, it is worth it!  Actually thinking about pushing all the way to end of February just because it‚Äôs been so beneficial. We shall see!

You got this."

keto,Nope. Just making an opposite point that it‚Äôs not always a great idea to over consume carbs every few weeks. Can‚Äôt people have two different opinions? All righty then.
keto,"Thanks for reply. It doesn't feels like infection or could is the cause. This feeling is in both years, and they both hurt equally. It feels more like blood pressure issue or something similar."
keto,"Ok, sounds like a you thing and you know it. Are you asking me to censor myself as a gatekeeper?"
keto,The lite salt has sodium and potassium.
keto,What‚Äôs the source of electrolytes? Did you a specific powder water mix?
keto,"I thought this was another GME post. 

Congrats on the great work. Keep it up"
keto,"Well I guess to some, it‚Äôs a permanent way of eating and thinking. I think done correctly, the mindset of ‚Äú I‚Äôm being deprived‚Äù goes away. A lot can‚Äôt get back to what‚Äôs best for them in the long run, which is why they‚Äôre here in the first place. I being one of them."
keto,ChocZero is the best! You won‚Äôt regret the dark chocolate peppermint bark!
keto,Your clogged ears have nothing to do with keto. I‚Äôve had problematic ears since childhood and they usually get clogged due to a cold or sinus infection. My favorite home remedy is to pour hydrogen peroxide into the cap and soak a cotton ball in the liquid and put in your ear while lying on your side (so the liquid will drip into your ear canal. You‚Äôll feel/hear bubbling but it will break up whatever clog you have! Good luck.
keto,"I was in the same boat as you until I did a couple of water fasts with just electrolytes and water. It was honestly pretty damn depressing not losing while being strict and doing everything like you did and weighed food and tracked on mfp. 

It's hard the first time, but it took me from a 4 month plateau, even when I was eating at a huge caloric deficit, to continuously losing again! I do random 48-72 hour fasts and it has worked great for me!"
keto,"I'd ask both of em both of those tbh, haha"

keto,"First time I did keto I was 22 (Atkins was the thing back then- but I stuck in the induction phase which is generally what keto is now without macros since the science wasn't there yet) and I lost about 75lbs in about 4 months. It just fell off. Never had a plateau. Never had  a stall. Just lbs lost every single day. I have done low carb in different forms again and again over the years losing 15-30lbs each time. But every time it's never been as fast and easy as it was that first time. Now I'm 43. I am losing around 8lbs a month on average. I had some good months where I lost up to 14, but some very slow ones where I only lost 5. But it's a long game. It will and is happening. I also have insulin resistance, fatty liver and hypertension, and am perimenopausal - none of which I had back when I was 22. So it comes with the territory. Just keep going. Even if it's slow, it's better than I was this time last year."
keto,Hottie pants!
keto,You can do it! Way to go
keto,Absolutely! Give me a few minutes
keto,"I'm on the same track as you! That said, I'm hoping to take less than a year to lose 30 lbs. Good luck to us!"
keto,Lol I‚Äôm excited and ready to go I just need a little help. That‚Äôs basically why I joined Reddit to be honest. I‚Äôm going keto shopping this weekend so if you don‚Äôt mind and have a few minutes please share with me a good grocery list to start and keep in mind I can‚Äôt cook for shit lol. Do you know if slim fast keto is the real deal for meal replacement?
keto,In the same line of thinking being too strict leads to burn out and a several day bender. If they are incapable of it the onus is on them.
keto,All I can do is encourage you to keep going. See it through!  You've got this!
keto,Not everyone can handle this mindset.
keto,"There you go then. Problem solved! If you decide to try keto, eat two meals per day."
keto,"Awesome stuff man! I just started a 3 day fast last night. I try to do them once a month. Can you explain something for me. I did omad for a few months. How is 20:4 any different than OMAD for you? I noticed that I couldn‚Äôt even stay awake an hour after eating, so do you just do light snacks and such?"
keto,"This is how I started. I was having a very hard time overhauling my entire diet. I was addicted to sugar and junk food. I started by just removing soda - went to lite lemonade for a few weeks, then to unsweetened tea. Then I picked the next thing - deserts after dinner. Handful of cashews, a sf jello cup, a bit of heavy cream whipped with some unsweetened cocoa powder. After I got used to that, I cut out my morning and afternoon sugar/junk snacks and replaced them with cheese sticks, pepperonis, dill pickles (low carb snacks), and so on and so on until I was basically on an IF schedule of 16:8 and fully keto. I lost 10lbs from feb-june as I transitioned my eating habits. And then from June - current, I've lost another 80 - about 8-10lbs each month. It was slow but I don't regret it at all. I have learned to eat and how different foods affect me. If I eat something that's not working for me, it's easy to identify. And you don't have to cut it out all together, replace it. It might take a bit, but take the time and find a replacement. After a while you may not need that snack or desert at all anymore. I probably have an afternoon snack every third day or so now. And dessert maybe once a week. I used to have both snacks and desert every single day and add a couple cans of soda. It was a lot of extra calories I didn't need."
keto,"I have but I find myself going back almost everyday. It's really informative. Keto takes so much discipline, I didn't think I'd make it to day 8 (or 9)."
keto,"Ooooo, the first month of keto is the best! Lol I mean that sarcastically and literally. It sucks because of all of the side effect that you swear you should go to see a doctor about, it‚Äôs great because you get soooooooo into it. At least I did. I became the healthiest nut, I even made something I called keto goulash when I was doing OMAD, basically one serving was 1700 calories and had every single vitamin and mineral in it üòÅ it was pretty dang tasty too, it just looked like hammered shit"
keto,"You've got this.  LOL I literally live in the mountains, and climb them.  And plan to continue as long as I have legs and breath :D"
keto,"If you've not read this Subs [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq/) you should spend some time going through it, it's a great, no BS resource."
keto,Just about to board the wagon lol. Never fell off I‚Äôm a newbie üòä
keto,You're 100%r ight
keto,"Let us know please, ok?"
keto,Good for youüëçüèº This gives me hope.  I'm a BP 'patient' so to speak for years now. Since I started keto my BP went down. I still use medication but hopefully I can stop using meds when I start to lose weight.
keto,"Bro nice! You look so good and much younger. Reading your story just gives me more inspiration on my weight loss journey. I was at 344 when I began losing weight and I‚Äôm currently at 280. That‚Äôs 64 pounds lost so far. I don‚Äôt know what my final weight is going to be yet, but for I‚Äôm going to focus on losing 30 more pounds. Anyways, see you in the pit. ü§ò"
keto,That's perfect. I needed to hear that
keto,"Cheese, cream cheese and fat bombs are super easy to each too much of also avocado is super high calorie. Getting a food scale will help so much to have you not overeat these things. I can't find the calorie budget to eat a whole avocado so I'd recommend cutting that to 1/2 to 1/4 before your food scale arrives."
keto,Thank you. I‚Äôm glad for these comments. Makes me feel better. I had surgical menopause and since then I‚Äôve gained so much weight. I guess it‚Äôs the lack of hormones messing with my weight. I have to lose this weight for my health so I have no choice but it just feels like such a mountain to climb.

keto,Magnesium glycinate is the most gentle on the stomach.  Protein powder is fine.
keto,Keto flu is not experienced by everyone. If your diet wasn't super bad before and you are getting electrolytes you will do great
keto,"Higher protein is going to make a huge difference with weight loss. They look great. I eat more protein than fat every day, and when I was actively trying to lose weight it was the best thing I did!"
keto,Yes to this!!
keto,Sweet. Was worried I needed to lower p and up f. Either way it's sure better than what I used to be doing hahaha. I'll upload progress photos when I workout how
keto,"I agree that if you aren't hungry at breakfast time, just don't eat. However, you might want to talk to your doctor and get to the root of your stomach troubles -- that sounds really terrible and you shouldn't have to rearrange your eating schedule to avoid pain. That said, a mild breakfast that I like to eat when I get tired of eggs is chia seed pudding. I mix a couple tablespoons of chia seeds with a cup of unsweetened almond milk and a tiny bit of cinnamon and vanilla, let it sit overnight, and then top with a few berries. Not sure how that will affect your stomach but might be worth a try."
keto,"You macros are on point for your stats, honestly. Well done. Keep it going!!"
keto,"Started keto today. 130g of protein, 142g of fat, and *20.7g of carbs*. I know it's a good start but the .7 is frustrating especially since I thought I planned correctly. Oh well. I look forward to seeing what happens in a month!"
keto,Good inspiration for me!
keto,"No,  they are plug in electric griddle kinda like a panini press"
keto,"For ideas:

You gotta try some almond butter with cinnamon. Game changer. This is how I first tried it but I'm sure I could just add some cinnamon to almond butter.

keto,Just don‚Äôt eat breakfast? I don‚Äôt. My first meal is at 11 or 12 most days. I wake up at 6:30 or 7:00. Might be worth trying.

keto,"Life goes on,  and so should you"
keto,"I have made some nut snack packs for myself. 1/4 cup and it comes in at 220 calories and 3g carbs. They are easy to keep in my bag and satisfying when I need them. Some of my other favorites:
Almond butter and celery,
Olives,
Tuna salad and cucumber,
Some berries and 2 tablespoons of greek yogurt.

I track my day and prepare everything in the morning so I know I'm not derailing myself with unexpected carbs. More often than not I find I am skipping the snacks."
keto,"You can‚Äôt change what happened but you do have control over what you do in future starting now.  

Don‚Äôt beat yourself up just work towards being better as you go forward.   It takes practice but you can do it. 

Good luck"
keto,I‚Äôm perfectly fine if I don‚Äôt eat breakfast.
keto,That's kgs not lbs and I'm 175cm tall male
keto,"I've had the same problem.  I think it helps to keep a backup meal that you know you will want to eat even if you have no appetite - something junk food-ish like buffalo chicken dip or Mexicanish ground beef.  Tortilla chips are like 1g per chip, so sometimes I would let myself have five chips with the buffalo chicken dip.  It could be that you're missing a texture, like crunchiness from your meals?

It helps to have low carb versions of bread or tortillas.  Aldi has a zero carb bread that tastes like extra wheaty bread, and it's great in cheeseburgers if you toast it in butter first. I find that no matter how little appetite I have, I can always stomach a cheeseburger lol.  Their low carb tortillas are like 7g net carbs, which is not amazing but it's fine for an occasional treat.

It could be that you're also missing some acidity that could help brighten up your meals.  Try making some fresh homemade salsa or squeezing some lemon juice on whatever you're eating.  Hope this helps!"
keto,"Ok, I've already changed my macros and I'll give it a shot thanks"
keto,Constipation can cause nausea.
keto,I have a ketomojo -  been testing three times a day.  When is a good time to test?  Also if I am doing a strict keto diet and using OMAD fasting how much weight should I count on.  Lost 15lbs fairly quickly but now slower.  I am out to lose 85 lbs so just want to keep my expectations on Parr.
keto,Smart scales are pretty unreliable for measuring anything aside from weight.
keto,"You're still young ;)

I made the permanent lifestyle change at 64.  Lost 35 lbs that kept piling on after menopause, because I kept going back to the SAD after every time I'd use keto to lose it.  The first time I did keto I was 49, and I have no weight loss experience earlier than that, so nothing to compare it to, but the weight flew off at 49 and flew just as quickly at 64.

But understand that when I say flew off, I mean about a pound a week, which is great for a woman my size.  That's about what you lost in those 2 months.  Keep at it, you'll get there!"
keto,"I don‚Äôt know ‚Äúofficially‚Äù‚Äôbut I just got off a course of prednisone and I have the ‚Äòroid hunger like it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business. I normally get it when I‚Äôm on steroids but was enjoying the easy fullness that comes with keto. I‚Äôm a bottomless pit! 

So no answer just commiserating!"

keto,"George Foreman grill my friend. I lived out of a hotel too and packed one these bad boys with me. TSA always flagged me but worth it. You can cook sausage or reheat burgers, chicken etc. 

I had a little kit - some paper products (bowls usually) end a little thing of dish soap and a small set of plastic silicone tongs. 

Also most hotels will give you a mini fridge if you ask or a microwave. Then you can do omlettes in the microwave and those steam bagged veggies.

keto,"Two small bites isn't going to make any difference. Really. You're good. Try not to develop too much of a purist mindset, such that a bite or two of pizza causes an emotional crash. 

Focus on getting your protein - that's what will maintain your muscle mass as you lose weight. Your carbs are good. Fat isn't a goal, it's a limit."
keto,"eat chicken, vegetables, dairy, skip meals, eat carbs when you feel like cooking them with dinner"
keto,Time tested by tens of thousands here. Give those numbers a go and come back with updates! You've got this!
keto,I'm on it! FYI I'm 22%BF
keto,"I had a ton of stomach issues after my divorce. 

I ended up doing g the whole30 and realized it was dairy and carbs that were to blame. 

Back then I went keto for my digestive health (my weight was fine). It made such a huge difference. 

It sounds like many of the foods that trigger you are carbs. You may find keto helps?"
keto,"My son‚Äôs birthday was on Saturday. I took a bite of the cake. That is a huge win compared to the multiple servings I would usually have had. Progress, not perfection."
keto,Far more reasonable
keto,I‚Äôm just starting keto now. I‚Äôd love to hear what exactly did you eat? I‚Äôm using Keto Chow right now with some additional protein and fats. You look great!
keto,"You need electrolytes, not just water. Plain water can actually flush electrolytes and dehydrate you even more. 

Make sure you‚Äôre getting adequate sodium, potassium, and magnesium. The recommended amounts are in the FAQ and automod"
keto,"Agreed, how much fat do you recommend? My current macro 111g. I'm using Cronometer and I'm nowhere near 111g today. I'm not like starving myself either, so I figure as long as I hit my minimum of 30g, I should be good, right?"
keto,And others.  Efa supplements are a thing.  Look it up
keto,"Hard to tell from your food count what this day and all the others actually amount to.

Head over to the FAQ , read up on keto, use the macro calculator (set on sedentary and a 20% deficit), and check out your numbers.

Then, spend a week or so meticulously measuring what you eat and drink (weighing your food is best for this) and tracking it all. All food, fats and cooking oils, alcohol, beverages, all. See how it compares to your macros.

Bottom line is that if you do not lose weight over weeks and months, you're eating at maintenance.

That said, 7 lbs in 2.5 weeks is just fine. I'm saying, develop greater knowledge of what you're eating and carry on. If you do not lose weight over time, you're eating at maintenance."

keto,"For me it took looking back on my last achievements and realizing that if I keep binge eating carbs that I was gonna throw away 2 years of what I‚Äôve strived for , but what you ate is like probably less then 10 grams of carbs so don‚Äôt sweat it and keep on eating keto , also what helped with cravings is lowering anything that caused a spike which for me was whey protein , if I were u I would up the fat and meat , extra fat really helped me mentally to not have cravings and i am a huge binge eater if you read one of my posts you will see lol"
keto,Just acknowledge that you did it and get back on track
keto,"What happens if you don't eat breakfast? I never do. My first meal is at noon.

Almost everything on your problem list of foods doesn't fit into a keto diet anyway, except coffee.

On keto, you avoid sugar, grains, starchy veg and most (or all) fruit.

Read the FAQ and see if this way of eating appeals to you."
keto,You look great! ü•µ‚ù§Ô∏è
keto,Read the Automod post. You need electrolytes.
keto,What electrolytes are you supplementing in what amounts? There's a reco in the FAQ. Sounds like you're at least low in sodium. You can indeed be dehydrated if all of that water speeds right through your system. And be needing those supplements.
keto,That‚Äôs not cheating.
keto,"Be careful on the amount of fats you are consuming. Being at your weight you body already has fat reserve to burn, so you don‚Äôt want to eat so much fat that you are just burning what you eat.
I‚Äôve read a lot and losing 5-10lbs a month is typical, probably more if you are doing cardio 3-4x week. If you aren‚Äôt losing any weight after a couple weeks, lower your fat intake. Also you may want to monitor /count calories at first."
keto,"Absolutely incredible! You put in the work and the results speak for themselves. Be proud of yourself, you have most certainly earned the right."
keto,"Yep, I've dieted my whole life and never been on one that feels so sustainable.  Quick at first and now a steady 2ish per week, no hunger pains, no urge to cheat.  I went through the holidays without an issue at all!"
keto,"Good job! I'm also very close to same victory, 30.8 ATM :)"
keto,ü§£ so true
keto,"Everyone gave me shit about keto and how worried they were about my health. 

They all stopped asking questions when I got down to 15% body fat and looked 10 years younger."
keto,"I have made it three times now. So far I have eaten it in beef stroganoff, chicken alfredo, and simple buttered noodles. It for sure needs a flavorful sauce because the Carbalose flour is just not as flavorful. But I have been playing around with adding flavors. I found that including a clove or two of garlic helps. For my next batch I am going to try adding some stevia because I think that so much of our food has a sweet tone that we do not even notice. I also want to try adding spinach, basil, and still thinking through other flavors.

The texture seems to be exactly like regular homemade pasta (I had never made it with regular flour), it looked just like the pasta on the YouTube video. I would for sure suggest to use some sort of pasta maker rather than attempting to roll it out on your own. Once I figured out how to follow directions (haha!) and make it correctly it handled and looked exactly like regular pasta."
keto,I have cheese on cheese. That goes down well!
keto,"I just don't tell people, it's not worth the conversation, just carry on until your at such a good weight that people beg you to tell them your secret, then still don't tell them."
keto,Exactly what the person below said.
keto,Bingo!
keto,"Boiled egg or chunk of chicken.     

But since I went keto I found I don't need to snack at all and the habit was quickly abandoned. It's the difference between 'hunger' and 'wanting to eat.'"
keto,"I am 61 years old, I too am transgender and struggled with this my whole life. I‚Äôve also struggled with my weight, so I understand. I am very happy for you, keep your life positive do sensible things God bless you"
keto,"I am currently studying in University, I am moderately overweight, around 100 kg at 168 cm and if I could move out right now, I would. In my area, finding a job WITH experience is near impossible, let alone without experience, so when I do graduate, I plan to move to a different location to find a job. Until then though, I have to put up with this."
keto,"&gt;You don't need fiber.

Of course not... you also don't need to switch your diet up so fast that your gut bacteria is completely wrong as it's adapted to tons of sugar... 

As an aside, technically no. You don't need fiber. However, some things won't leave your body without it."
keto,"You can use butter. Also, substitute the tofu for a ribeye. It's healthier."
keto,"Too much negativity. Period. Stop. 
That‚Äôs where we are with society right now.   Congrats on your progress. Stay positive!"
keto,"Quoted 22k CAD plus tax in Canada for breasts and tummy. 
About 12k in dominican republic"

keto,Fantastic weight loss. Enjoy that coffee.
keto,"Hi. My mom has done a program like that; but different country. I don't know what your question about it is; but if it is ""does it work?"" for her it worked and she does not need diabetes medication anymore.

I have learned over here from the kind reddit keto people; that carb manager is an better app. It is also free. And it indeed is. I used to use myfitnesspall too. The downside is you have to pay for iron/calcium/vitamin/etc-tracking. But the food you add is way more precise then myfitnesspall; which often has foods with incorrect stats."
keto,"The big irony about critiques of low carb diets is that nobody wants to warn or shame you about the single most dangerous/unhealthy part of a low carb diet: too much protein. You can eat lean protein all day and they won't bat an eye while you kill yourself.

You need some specific proteins and fats to survive. They have building blocks your body needs but can't make for itself. You also need a few vitamins, minerals, and salts that come from a variety of dietary sources (or supplements).

Everything else is burned, if possible, and you need something to burn for energy.

Our bodies are optimized for burning sugar (and other short carbohydrates) and fat. Excess will be turned into fat for burning later. If you burn more calories that you eat, you will lose weight (some people can eat a high carb diet and be healthy as long as they get the fats they _need_, along with the other things mentioned above).

**Our bodies are _not_ optimized for burning protein.** If you eat a ton of protein and have a significant caloric deficit in your carb and fat intake, your body will start burning protein. This is extremely unhealthy, even for otherwise _necessary and healthy_ proteins, a fact that has been known for ages -- long before low carb diets became popular ~20 years ago."
keto,"I‚Äôm kind of in-line with the OP, I like my protein. But I like for a lot of that to come from beef which has pretty good fat levels in most cuts anyway. lean protein doesn‚Äôt do a lot for me but I enjoy eating it more than making a bulletproof coffee for example. So I guess I‚Äôm somewhere in the middle. I do tend to get 30-35% proteins most days and pretty heavy on beef."
keto,I use a mixture of almond flour and Parmesan cheese for a breadcrumb/crispy texture.
keto,Do not puke. Mistakes are part of the process. Don't be so hard on yourself. Tomorrow you can try all over again.
keto,I lost 43 lbs on keto in the past 3 months and disproved everyone around me. Can't wait to start again
keto,For baking I use xanthan gum. I‚Äôll give it a shot today/tonight and report back.
keto,"Is there a big difference between low carb and keto? I am cutting carbs and learning what to eat without the carbs, but I'm not sure if a very strict keto diet is the most sustainable option for me. What do you think? Go the extra mile with a big chance of burning out or doing it at my own pace. 

If you have any tips and tricks that would also be great!"
keto,"They are fine. In comparison to other vegs they are F/avoid. The app does not know people don't usually eat like 6 whole onions in one sitting like we chow away broccoli/zucchini (well; unless onion soup...)

If you just use your garlic/onion to flavour dishes like people most often do; it's not a problem. 

But don't forget to add them in your counting-app."
keto,Oil ?
keto,Ewww yes!!! This 100% I can practically see the toxic looking food colouring
keto,Omg I would want to slap that boss
keto,That drives me crazy!!!
keto,"I've been getting on the keto train again after being off it for some time (and gaining weight and feeling worse and worse). A friend (from a loving place, I get it) said that he still thinks I should get my bloodwork done etc. Not a bad as such idea, I know.

But the thing that gets me is that when I weighed close to 120 kg (around 260 lbs), not a single person told me to go get my bloodwork done or gave me unsolicited eating advice. That started when I got down to around 90. Then I got ""Don't lose weight too fast"" etc. 

But when I was fat as hell, probably at least pre-diabetic and unhealthy, not one single comment."
keto,I was just thinking ‚Äúmaybe use some full stops or commas every now and then‚Äù haha
keto,"Hardboiled eggs, deli meat, rotisserie chicken, protein shake, and/or larger meals so you don‚Äôt need to snack!"
keto,"Thanks, appreciate your reply and advice."
keto,Thanks for the suggestion.
keto,Some people are just dumb...keto is great.
keto,"I‚Äôm very vocal about my diet.  While I‚Äôm not strict keto anymore, and I never did it for weight loss (still lost 16 lbs), it‚Äôs helped put my chronic inflammatory disease (AS) in remission.  And I tout the work it does for diabetics and people with gastric issues as well (helped my GI issues). At least 6 people I know closely have started eating less carbs and overall healthier because they‚Äôve seen how it helps me, maybe more if I‚Äôve convinced people on other sub Reddit‚Äôs for my disease.  You don‚Äôt even have to go to 30g a day and an 18 hour fast to feel the effects of a lower carb intake.  Hopefully more people see the benefits."
keto,"Numbers are right... just unnecessarily complicated a bit (calculating both weight and volume, %). 

6500g broth / 36g net carbs = 0.55g net carbs / g broth 

0.55g x weight of your serving = net carbs in your serving"
keto,"What a hard Life you have, keep it up."
keto,How was the pasta?
keto,"The problem I realized is, people think eating carbs and sugar is ""Normal"" and that low fat is proper while not knowing it's a gimmick by sugar industry...

and that Keto is ALL about weight loss. I see many weight loss forum talking about keto without a single mention about insulin control and other factors except calories in calories out debate.

And that it's just a tool to solve their symptom.... of being fat. Like a medicine that they can use it to get rid of the weight, then go back to their ""Normal"" diet.

After learning about keto, I realized this is a slow creeping pandemic worst than Covid, it's just kills you slower and much more fragmented unnecessary deaths that it seems ""ok"" and ""normal""."
keto,"Thanks for the advice, I'll take that suggestion onboard."
keto,"Fun fact:

Fructose is what will destroy your liver. That's were fructose is metabolised. causing fatty liver disease, if eaten in excess. 

regular white table sugar is ~50% fructose

You can probably guess what is in ""high fructose corn syrup"""
keto,"a ""standard"" diet will cause weight gain, for most people (hence why over 50% of the population is overweight)

so yes, you should be keto for life. Not just while trying to lose weight..."
keto,i was hoping someone would say it
keto,I remember listening to a dr on the radio about ‚Äòyo yo dieting‚Äô and the bad rap it gets - she said it‚Äôs better to lose weight and put it back on than to never lose weight and be in a constant state of obesity.
keto,You don't need fiber.
keto,"The problem with diets is that someone will read 20 articles saying how rad it is... Do it, and then a week or two in read ""this diet might be bad for you"" and they give up because they found an excuse to quit the hard thing, and keep passing that on because they have to double down on the believe in that excuse to believe it themselves to not feel bad about quitting."
keto,"Try it, if it does not work at least you tried it.

1 year ago I wanted to lose some weight and found the keto diet. As I have never been a carb person I thought that this diet would fit me as I could still eat 80% of my favorite foods. But as time went by and I lost the weight I discovered that eating Keto was helping me to feel better in general. So now 1 year later I still follow the Keto diet but not for weight loss (now I need to watch my weight to not go any lower actually) but as I feel better in general. When I now sometimes indulge myself to a carb heavy meal within an hour I feel drouzy/lethargic general meh. Before keto I had this as well but never realised this. 

When you decide to start it can be hard if you are a carb persoon but it gets easier. Keep it simple, start tracking what you eat, read labels on food, read the FAQ and see if it works for you."
keto,Can't let the muscles waist away so you been good exersize.
keto,Thanks so much. That‚Äôs a great tip! I‚Äôm currently sitting consistently around 20g of carbs per day but am not paying as close attention to my protein so will do now.
keto,Eating too much protein can actually get you out of keto through a process called gluconeogenesis.
keto,How about get your dr to write you a script for a CGM. Continuous Glucose Monitor. Get an idea of what‚Äôs really going on all day instead of random checks.
keto,That‚Äôs freaking hilarious.  I am a little concerned that people think Ramona Flowers was an acceptable source over regular doctors and nutritions but that is hilarious nonetheless.
keto,"I know how you feel. I explained why everyone's wrong and why keto is the bast way of eating like million times. The key, is yourself being knowledgeable about it and being able to defeat anyone's arguments. 

Keto is a long term lifestyle. The key to success is making it sustainable long-term. None should leave keto, go back to eating junk food and expect to have a long-term immunity for gaining weight  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

Watch this video about the most misunderstood diet in the world on YouTube, it will give you the basis for answering those negative comments of others üëå

keto,"Focus on hitting your protein goal as that‚Äôs going to be the most important macro. üëçüèª Nutrient dense is always a great idea, too! The hunger/appetite will return soon, I swear!"
keto,Thanks so much. Just as I thought. I think if I really try to add the evening meal even when not hungry and make it something light but nutrient dense it‚Äôll be a better idea than not eating because I‚Äôm not hungry.
keto,"None of this is the sort of thing I would eat every day. I have had one keto dessert in a week and three 1""sq pieces of keto chocolate. Is what I'm doing significantly wrong?"
keto,r/vegetarianketo and r/veganketo may have some great answers for you!
keto,My rosacea went away...I attributed that to a lotion I happened to try. Wondering now if it was my change in eating habits. Good job and thank you for inspiring update
keto,"What are your stats and what were your macros? What did you eat? 

You said you drank ketoade, but how many mgs of sodium, magnesium, and potassium did you get every day?"
keto,Congrats. I hope you make it better everyday!
keto,"Eating 600-700 calories a day is not sustainable long term. This is crash dieting and can cause muscle loss, thinning hair, micronutrient deficiencies, etc. I do not recommend doing IF if you‚Äôre only able to eat this low number of calories in your eating window. Add another meal and eat more food."
keto,Of course.. just curious how it would be calculated in the scenario above and then grilled/cooked... etc.
keto,That's what's up dizzle! Get it!
keto,"You got it bro.  If you can get in deep enough you can incorporate fasting days a couple days a week without even noticing.

Then its warp speed yo!  I went from over 200 to 155 in less than 2 months a few years back.  I did have some uhh personal problems due to the hormones involved in rapid stored fat utilization but it started working again in a week or 2.  So in honesty don't go that extreme.

I was over 300lbs at one point and keto will 100% get you where you wanna be."
keto,"Also why do you pick my cheat days? I love a cheat day but Imma do it on the weekend when me and my husband are making enchiladas, not on a miserable office Thursday because Karen brought in dollar store cupcakes"
keto,"I cant remember the exact amounts but roughly for every 1 gram of Glycogen (Carbs) stored in your body/muscles your body stores 4 grams of water. So once you are on Keto you have very little or no glucose in your body, so you lose that water weight quickly over the first week or so. 

Its unavoidable that when you stop doing keto as your body adapts again to Glycolysis that you gain back that 'water weight' 

Its different for everyone, but I found that i gained roughly 6 pounds after a week of stopping keto, so when I do keto and cut i aim for 10lbs lower than my goal weight so I have a little wiggle room."
keto,"Haha yeah, people are to arrogant to accept that this amazing diet works, most of the time better than the rest"

keto,Isn't it crazy how fast it starts coming off? And you feel so GOOD.
keto,Preach!!!! I get the eye roll from a few friends of mine because I‚Äôm doing keto.  I feel better and I‚Äôm already down -12lbs in like 2 weeks.  If people would stop being so gullible and just research the obesity epidemic then maybe they‚Äôd wake up and see high fat/low carb is the cure. It‚Äôs the high sugar and processed carbs that‚Äôs making people fat and sick.

keto,"Keep it up bro life changes work.  I was a 305 lb lineman in 10th grade, 210 senior year and I had to learn linebacker.   Just don't lose too much.  I have maintained  165-200 for 20 years now but one time cutting from just over 200 to my ""ideal"" weight.....I got there in about 2 months (keto + wet fasting) and ppl thought I looked imaciated.  155 is not a good look on me. 

If ur an average height guy I bet you can get to 200 without batting an eyelash if you stay in moderate (little deeper) ketosis and start bringing in day long wet fasts.  At that level of ketosis you literally don't notice you aren't eating. Strive for dark purple pee strips!*

This is from a guy that loves eating.

Just keep occupied if you struggle.

keto,I immediately watched it. It was really good! Thank you for recommending it!
keto,Yes count the oil and the sugar. It‚Äôs better to calculate your meal as too many calories then not enough. Otherwise it‚Äôs harder to create a deficit when you‚Äôre constantly rounding down on trace ingredients.
keto,"I dont know what all is in ketoaid but it sounds like you weren't consuming enough calories. I had the same thing happen the first time I tried, I got a splitting headache, depression, just felt like crap. I found that it just takes more time for me to adjust. If you do try again I would start slower, first cut out all grains and any sugary drinks. Then work on cutting the starchy vegetables. Then im usually ready to jump in. I start with bulletproof coffee, I usually eat a heavy lunch and dinner for 2 or 3 days then im good. I dont worry about counting the calories for those couple days either its more important for me to get into ketosis and making those keytones then I found I start naturally reducing the calories."
keto,I‚Äôm proud of you!
keto,Get well soon! Are you taking Vitamin D?
keto,"They are just jealous. Because you have the willpower to create positive change using the same method they once tried that resulted in their failure. They are actually disappointed in themselves and their defence mechanism is to try to pull you back to their level, so that they dont have to feel bad about the failure.

You will gain the weight back only if you go back to eating at surplus. Even if you quit keto but still eat at maintenance you wont gain it back. Probably a bit of water weight when you carb up but its just water.."
keto,Just don't put sugar in your marinades.
keto,I don't understand how will power and commitment are different things. Doing something a 1000th time is still just as hard as doing it the first time.
keto,"Most of my food intake is through a keto soylent, which balances everything and is largely fat. But I cheat on other things. I'm thinking I might need to get stricter and see if that helps.

Re electrolytes, the soylent has then so I can't separate them. I could possibly get a supplement (or have chai/sesame seeds as the other comment suggests) if it's not bad overconsuming magnesium?

keto,"Reading through your posts and here's all I can say.

If you want to succeed at anything - work, relationships, even hobbies - there is effort required. Low effort = poor results. The same is true of any eating plan. If you don't gather your supplies and make a plan for the week - beyond eggs - you're unlikely to see success without that consistency that, yes, is required. For anything.

That includes seeing your family. If you commit to this lifestyle and want to maintain it, you'll need to set boundaries around food. Let them know before any visit that you don't eat sugar, grains, fruit or starchy veg. Ask them if they can support you in that or not. Be pleasant, calm and clear. If you have to, tell them your doctor wants you to eat this way and you're going to follow doctor's orders.

You'll need to sort yourself out to adopt this lifestyle. Supplement your electrolytes properly - fatigue and low energy come from low electrolytes and is easily fixed. Your mornings will be fine. Cook food in large batches so you only have to cook a few times per week. Track how much you're eating. Put in the time.

There is no magic to getting healthy. You need to actively engage in your life, make a weekly plan, get your supplements, be consistent and deal with your family in a mature way. You are not causing problems by choosing how you eat. They are introducing tension and conflict by opposing your choices.

Read the FAQ thoroughly and a few times. Follow all the recommendations and you'll thrive. This is not about will power. It's about planning and commitment. If you really want this to happen, it will."
keto,"Do you have a brand recommendation that works for you? I've had mixed experiences, but am open to trying again."
keto,"I'm not good with planning for things. I only buy groceries for the same day - usually just for the next meal - because I know myself well enough that if I buy something that I'm not craving for at that particular moment, just in case I'll want it later, I'll be throwing it in the trash uneaten and spoiled two weeks later.

 The only consistent habit I have is doing laundry at 2 am. Not because I've decided that 2 am is the best hour to do laundry, but because that's the hour in which I'm statistically most likely to have both energy, motivation and free time to do laundry.

Also doesn't pizza have carbs? Where are you getting no-carb freezer pizza?"
keto,You are truly an inspiration!! Congratulations to you. Thank you for sharing your story.  It greatly motivating.
keto,"Ôøº ÔøºDid you read the FAQ? 

https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq

Are you getting 5000mg sodium, 1000-3500mg potassium, and 500mg bioavailable magnesium daily?

If the answer is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how many mg I am getting,‚Äù start tracking it.

Buy salt and salt substitute in the grocery store. You don‚Äôt need any fancy products or pills for sodium and potassium. Magnesium glycinate is very cheap on amazon to boot.

The keto flu is nothing more than electrolyte deficiency. It can happen anytime you are deficient, not just at the start."
keto,"Agreed..Keto aint easy in the beginning   it is a mindset.  Stay strong and hold on to your goal (s) It is tough because  you are used to eat carbs..Temptation is around us and everywhere..try to overcome it. 
For me same with cigarettes..its bad but still nice. Do I keep smoking because its nice or do I stop smoking because its bad.  Option two is the best option.. Thats how I look at Keto. Eating carbs is nice..but not good. Keep going.. Stay motivated !You can do it!"
keto,"Keto is awesome!  I forgot that my forehead used to be as dry as the goddamn Sahara desert and now it's as supple as a baby's bottom.  Thanks, keto!"
keto,"It's  likely possible. It all depends on mom's relationship with food and her behavior. If she was always stressed out, complaining, and freaking out about her diet than it absolutely could have been a contribution factor. Especially if she was extremely vocal about her diet being so hard, and how fat she was, and how eating carbs was going to kill her.

The one part I completely disagree with is the fact that the diet was very challenging. Keto is easy, is it convenient? Not always but it is easy. Meat, veggies done."
keto,Do you want to make a plan? I‚Äôm serving freezer pizza with bagged salad for lunch. That‚Äôs simple and easy. ‚ÄúMore‚Äù simple and easy is relative.

keto,"Seems that a lot of those frozen meals on performance kitchen have quite high carbs. I didn't click through them all, but most I did look at seem to be in the 12-16 net carbs for a single frozen meal. Saw a few that were lower but for me it would be a hard pass.

The burgers are fine, although I personally am not a fan of microwaved burgers Even if I grill them myself reheating them in a microwave gives them a funny taste to me. I'll definitely do it sometimes, I just don't love the flavor."

keto,"Adding fat doesn't make coffee, or any food, 'keto'"
keto,"Well, are there options that are more *simple and easy* than just eating 20 eggs per day?"
keto,Twenty is a safe choice. It works for just about everyone and gives a little cushion if you miscalculate.
keto,"The thing is, exiting ketosis for a day or even a few days doesn't screw up months of work. You go out, you go back in. It doesn't erase the past. It's best not to have too rigid a view, since slip ups can happen here and there."
keto,"But as I said, it doesn‚Äôt change anything if you did because it‚Äôs like one day. You won‚Äôt even notice if you were so again, not worth the stress."
keto,"I didn't run into that issue, however if I did I'd quickly let them know that if they insist on telling me how to eat or trying to force things on me I'd cut off seeing and talking to them until such a time they decide to respect my lifestyle. This goes for family and boyfriends or girlfriends."
keto,"&gt; The hardest part of sticking to my diet is converting everyone around me into it.

Okay then."
keto,Yeah I don‚Äôt think I got kicked out I honestly think I‚Äôd feel worse if I got kicked out I tend to worry a lot about being kicked out to be honest so if I go over by 1 carb I freak out lol
keto,"hey everyone!, I just started my keto diet yesterday, I used [this keto calculator](https://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/) to figure out exactly how much I should eat, according to it I need to eat bellow 50 net carbs but in the faq, I think I saw that you need to stay under 20 grams net carbs.  
 so which is it bellow 20 or 50?"
keto,Amazing progress! What a difference. And every 10 lbs gone improves your health significantly. Congrats!
keto,Read the FAQ here and compare to what you're doing. And check out the section on sweeteners for moew info about maltitol.
keto,"There are carbs in eggs, but that‚Äôs not the point. Consider these macros:

Calorie Goal: 20% Deficit 

Protein: 99g  
Carbs: 20g  
Fat: 105g  

Target: 1425 kcal

There are a lot of ways to reach these goals in addition to eating twenty eggs each day."
keto,"I haven‚Äôt told my family about keto. I never tell them anything unless I absolutely have no choice, and if they ask, I‚Äôll usually lie. There‚Äôs whole sections of my life they know nothing about."
keto,"It‚Äôs irrelevant if you did. It doesn‚Äôt change anything. Go back to your keto eating and you‚Äôll be in ketosis in 24-48 hours. As you see, you‚Äôre not even sure you‚Äôre out of ketosis so why stress about it? Ketosis isn‚Äôt the goal, its not the sole reason for weight loss, it‚Äôs a beneficial side effect of this way of eating

You probably had very minimal carbs anyways. Half a tortilla is like 2 net carbs and those taco seasoning packets like 15-18 for the entire packet"
keto,"What are your macros and how are you tracking?

I had never heard of ketofabrix so I looked them up and I wouldn't eat those on a regular basis. Even though the label claims 2 net carbs the fact that they are sweetened with malitol makes them closer to 9; also malitol can cause some pretty bad stomach distress.

There is nothing wrong at all with Starbucks as long as you are keeping it low carb. What are your go to drinks there?"
keto,"I really liked iced coffee but mainly because of the added cream, sugar, and flavoring. It feels like cheating every day! 

If you eat the same foods often, you can figure out those macros once and then just repeat. I keep a piece of paper taped inside my cabinet where the food scale is. I put my salad bowl on the food scale and start adding. I wrote it down in order and just put the total weight instead of resetting to zero.  30g dressing, 45g cheese, 52g bacon bits, etc. I know exactly the macros for that meal by weight. I just had to do the math once. This might work for you? Whatever your plan is, make a plan to hit the protein first and then fill in with fat and carbs. Going over protein is fine! A lot of women do better with higher protein."
keto,"Just to add that you have also lowered significantly the chance of developing diabetes and other chronic diseases related to obesity. As you get older you will be more healthy for it, feel less pain and just have a better quality of life.

Congratulations man."
keto,"The only wrong way of doing keto is eating too many carbs. You can eat as you wish as long as you keep your carbs down. The right way to make sure of this is track your food. Some people can make do not tracking  or counting so it‚Äôs not wrong if or don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just good practice to do so."
keto,Foodscale + apps like carb manager and cronometer are life saviors
keto,"This is why the first rule of keto is beautiful.  I just never discuss what or how or why I eat I what I eat with anyone aside from my SO, ever, under any circumstances.  I think there's this drive when people start something new to tell everyone they know in order to try to gain people's approval or support or agreement and in reality, no one else's support, agreement or approval is required in any way, shape or form.  Just stop discussing it.  You don't need to be viewed as correct, and you don't need to keep making them wrong.  They get to do whatever the hell they want just like you do."
keto,Electrolytes. Read the faq regarding it. The amount we tend to lack on this diet is far more than we are getting in food or Gatorade zeros.
keto,"Small victory but still a victory! I've heard of people doing ""keto cheats"" although I've been advised against it. I rarely crave sugary foods anymore, but I wanted to go for a slice of coffee cake last night but I decided against it! Instead, I'm picking up some rebel ice cream for myself tonight."
keto,Not a plateau. Read the links the bot provided.
keto,"Congrats, this is amazing!"
keto,"It seems like the key to *everything* is consistency and it's the only goddamn thing that I don't have.

I'm considering just going for drugs. There has to be a way to lose weight."
keto,"Keto can bring down blood pressure quite rapidly all on its own. If you're on medication that lowers it even more, it can go too low. Do you take your blood pressure regularly? you might want to do that and then talk to your doctor about halving the dose and eventually stopping the medication, if it goes down enough."
keto,Simple! I get it. Thanks! I guess there‚Äôs no point in worrying about it as long as I‚Äôm eating low carb and I‚Äôm not gaining weight then I guess there‚Äôs nothing to worry about
keto,Thank you!!!
keto,"Are you getting enough electrolytes? It doesn't sound like it.

Please be sure to read the FAQ for this sub carefully, and I think things will get much easier for you."
keto,"Idk what to say, consistency is crucial at keto. Found out that myself, when in past I have been doing keto diet only at half effort and it was useless."
keto,"Well, that, fried eggs, and chicken.

I've counted that 5 eggs for every meal, four times per day, is zero carbs and 1500 calories, so that would be a compromise that covers both calorie- and carb issues. If I can isolate myself from other people completely and nobody's there to comment on my meals, it should work."
keto,"If you are eating keto as a lifestyle, you will encounter situations where you have to make choices and you will have to give yourself grace. You made good choices, potentially went slightly over your carb limit, and then got right back to it. Success!!"
keto,"Awesome, keep it up!"
keto,Read the FAQ. Then do a search in this sub for stall and read those posts and comments.
keto,"How long have you been on it? I wouldn't go off my regular diet if I had an infection - unless I had a high sugar diet, because that's really bad for your immune system."
keto,Well done!
keto,"It‚Äôs mostly just eggs,chicken and salmon and a lot of salads. Apparently 1 tbsp of olive oil is high in fat so if I just cook everything with olive oil would that help with the high fat part? Sorry for all the questions. I never even thought to mix the protein with coffee that‚Äôs literally the greatest idea ever"
keto,This does not seem like a reasonable plan. Is this what you have been eating?
keto,Just the fact that I could have possibly kicked myself out after going 4 months without kicking myself out. It happens though
keto,Stick with one ingredient foods while you get on your feet.
keto,What is frustrating you?
keto,"Is there more to supplementing electrolytes than just eating salt?

My diet plan for next week is to just eat boiled eggs. Just boiled eggs, can't bother with planning or cooking anything else, with table salt and pepper on them."
keto,Love this!
keto,I've used [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004164SRA) and so far it's lasted a year and a half with no issues.
keto,"Sure! Omad doesn‚Äôt work for everyone. If you want to do two meals, you could do a protein shake for 30g then two meals of 35g each. That is basically my plan. I need something in the morning so I mix coffee with my protein shake to make a kind of latte-ish drink then eat two meals. What are some of your common foods?"
keto,Cool! I thought I screwed up 4 months of work with 1 accidental meal thank god!
keto,Yeah I only had 1 plate as well. Besides I decided to try this chicken which I know was keto because I asked and it was just marinated in olive oil and garlic so. I came 500 calories below where I needed to be (I‚Äôm maintaining) so I‚Äôm probably just hungry from not eating enough yesterday but who knows I just got to keep with it. I‚Äôm just a bit frustrated
keto,Are you supplementing electrolytes? What it‚Äôs your keto plan? Maybe we can help?
keto,"No, you‚Äôre fine. You‚Äôll be back in ketosis in about 24 hours if you were kicked out. Once you‚Äôre fat adapted, it would take many days to completely undo that by eating lots of carbs over time."
keto,"Keto diet begins to function only after a while, for me it was around fifth day when I felt that keto flu is over, but it can vary for different people. So if you keep starting over and over it might actually be more painful and unpleasant. The consistency is absolutely crucial, even steady mild keto diet is better than strict one with interruptions because the start is always nasty.  
Another possiblity is that you do not have enough electrolytes which causes you feel bad. Being this groggy in the morning seems not OK even during keto flu."
keto,"Just keep to keto, nothing else needed. In situations where I haven‚Äôt preplanned my eating, I fix my whole plate at once so I can control portions and estimate what I‚Äôve taken. Part of what got me fat in the first place was mindless eating and grazing."
keto,"Yeah I reckon I could do that but probably have to have two meals to fit all of it in. I read the FAQ and learnt a lot also 
Thank you so much for all your help, you‚Äôre a star"
keto,"If you lost that much weight, it is the correct way. Nice work!"
keto,I have been eating the same thing I eat every day for my diet. I had some gum which has the same sweeteners I usually use. I kinda feel a bit shaky but I've had like 2 hours of sleep because of this issue

I told her it was amazing and asked for the recipe so I could try a keto version. No drama. However, if I had told her no, that I couldn't have it, she would have been sad but accepted it. Your family needs to respect you enough to support your decisions, even if they don't agree. Have a chat and tell them that if they want your occasional help, they need to stop because it stresses you out. Tell them you're an intelligent adult and have researched the best way to keep your body in the best health possible and that their sabotage feels like they're trying to hurt your health. Hopefully it eases off and you can just enjoy your family again. Hugs."

However, they don‚Äôt realize that limiting carbs is so much tougher. It‚Äôs not easy to stick to your keto diet during the holidays so don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself. On the other hand, you shouldn‚Äôt be too lenient either because as you said ‚Äìthe slow and steady slide will take you right back to square one. Each of us is different so what works for one person may not work for another. At this point, the important thing is to figure out what works for you. For instance, you mentioned that you need to go back to strict counting to get back into the swing of things. If that worked for you the last time, then you should definitely follow it. However, some people find it easier to start with a cyclical keto diet (keto cycling) where you have 5 days of keto followed by 2 days of more carbs. This has never worked for me but I know it has worked for others who use it as a way to transition back to their keto diet. There are several types of keto diets and you can experiment a little to find out what works for you. You can check out [this](https://www.everydayhealth.com/ketogenic-diet/diet/types-targeted-keto-high-protein-keto-keto-cycling-more/) link for a list of keto diet variations. 

A lot of the suggestions on getting back on your keto diet (and staying on) are very useful and I can tell you from personal experience that swampgreen‚Äôs idea of glittery nail polishes really works. I did something similar ‚Äì after I created my diet plan, I made a list of ‚Äútreats‚Äù for myself that were not food-related. I also made a list of things I wanted and I rewarded myself with one each time I hit a milestone. Yes, the goal is to get healthy and look great but having a tangible reward is a great way to motivate yourself to stay on track especially during the times when you find your resolve wavering ‚Äìit happens to all of us. You‚Äôve been diagnosed with binge eating disorder which means that the initial stages when getting back on track will be particularly difficult for you. A good way to stay on top of this is to clean out your kitchen and get rid of all foods that are not on your diet plan. At the same time, stock up on keto snacks, especially the kind of snacks that act as a substitute for regular snacks. I would recommend kale snacks ‚Äì the salty crunch will help to trick your brain into thinking that you‚Äôre eating a less healthy snack which will help you stay away from crisps and other high-carb snacks. Btw, kale chips are just 2.5 grams of carbs per serving. You can also increase the amount of water you drink to help you control your cravings. Researchers found that drinking an additional 6 cups of water (1.5 liters) can help to suppress appetite and cause body fat reduction. You can check out more about that [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4121911/). 

The most important thing is to figure out what works for you and then just get started. All the best."

keto,"A few days is not enough time for your body to get adapted. Wait at least one or two weeks.

If you're still feeling hungry after that, increase your fat intake. Fat is what makes you feel satiated for longer periods of time. But be sure to still eat the amount of protein recommended by the keto calculator. You need to eat a minimum of protein (the amount suggested by the calculator) to make sure you don't lose muscle mass. Fat is not mandatory on keto, but fat does help a lot with hunger management (once your body is adapted)."

keto,"Perhaps some dirty keto if fast food is what sounds good? 

Also I get so sick of meat I could die. Eggs my friend. Deviled eggs. Cheesy eggs. Eggs baked in creamed spinach.

Also for some reason when I have my meat aversion I also rely heavily on thin sliced pepperoni and or salami. Make a pizza. Devour. 

Again just my two cents. First time I tried keto I tried to do the plain everything and I failed miserably. Now I just recreate my junk food (without Frankenstein  ingredients) and that gets me over the hump. 

Oh and hot dogs!"

keto,"Yes, it could be.

Calories do still matter."
keto,"Hi! I also have an issue with binge eating which caused me to gain the 25-30 pounds that made me start keto in the first place to lose. I tried Keto before, but was really being lazy and allowing myself to have a carby cheat meal every weekend which got me nowhere in my weight loss. I‚Äôm now down about 15 pounds so far and here is what I did to help my binges and my desire to even binge: 

1. Mindset is everything. My binging came from a place of childhood trauma where I felt like I needed to eat as much as possible to feel safe and secure- to feel like it was ‚Äúmine.‚Äù Whenever I start to feel this feeling, I remind myself that that ‚Äúit will be here tomorrow.‚Äù
2. Intermittent Fasting. Some people like it, some people don‚Äôt- I in fact love it. I started off small, only eating from 12-8 and that helped me establish a routine and train my brain to help prevent those late night binges. If I start to get urges to eat, I just tell myself things like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt eat after 8pm. PERIOD.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do that.‚Äù
3. Nighttime routine. After my last bite for the day/around 8, I immediately drink water, brush my teeth, and do my skincare. This takes up about 30 minutes of my evening, makes my mouth taste clean, and helps prevent me from mindless snacking.
4. Last Meal. I personally like to eat a later dinner and have it be most of my calories for the day; then I allow myself to have a few berries to be dessert. Now my brain is now used to being done eating for the day after that. But eating a solid dinner with protein and good fats is key to feeling satiated. 

Hopefully one of these may help! I don‚Äôt have all the answers, but this is at least what helps me."
keto,You god damn lucky Canadians!! Makes my public health heart pitter patter to hear these things.
keto,Beautiful! Congratulations
keto,"Beta oxidation does skip glycolysis, but it is typically a secondary metabolic mechanism in high fasting states.  Normal metabolism typically involves glycolysis when you‚Äôre dealing with a well fed organism.  It also requires more ATP than normal cellular respiration, so it‚Äôs not the optimized metabolic route.

Look, I‚Äôm not here to rain on your parade or argue about it.  My point wasn‚Äôt that it was bad to do keto but more that it‚Äôs utilizing mechanisms that I *could* see creating issues in some populations.  I think the diet is fine.  I just think more multi-year studies may be needed before declaring it safe or optimal in the long term."
keto,It's incredible. So worth a read/listen
keto,I have not but it sounds interesting.
keto,"It depends on how metabolically healthy you are.  People who eat a lot of carbs without putting on weight or suffering bad health outcomes don't need to limit them.  Others of us who are not so fortunate don't have that flexibility.  And there are those for whom a small detour takes them months to get back on track.

Do a search for Megan Ramos and holidays.  She has some clever strategies on how to navigate a special diet with cultural holiday food traditions.  In a nut shell, she eats before attending holiday events, eats carefully from the available options, and chooses one special food to add to her plate and eats it last."
keto,It's not magic.  It's your hard work and dedication to better health.  You should be very proud of your accomplishment.
keto,how is one supposed to not be hungry with this diet plan?

keto,Great job. Did you also track calories or just do keto? I started off with keto but wasn‚Äôt tracking calories and stopped losing weight because I ended up just eating way too many calories.
keto,"I guess you‚Äôre somehow not familiar with beta oxidation?

keto,"Sundays and other major feast days if you're a more traditional Christian. 

Regarding Christmas, I don't know that I've ever seen it treated as a one day food affair.

But I think you get my point. Some low-carbers go on about eating only ""real food"", which always makes me wonder what the traditional food choices of most of the globe would be considered? After all, ketogenic/low carb diets aren't what sustained most of the world throughout history, so what changed in so far as our relationship to carbohydrates?

keto,Yeah I actually have patches and in Canada you can get free cessation products just by calling the pharmacy.
keto,"I don‚Äôt supplement, for the most part. I also do 18:6, so 60g of protein per meal. It ends up being like 2 small pork chops, 7oz chicken breast, one XL can of tuna, or 1/3 of a 1lb package of cooked ground beef. My favorite recipe is instant pot kalua pig from nom nom paleo because it makes a lot of leftovers and I can repurpose them. My go-to easy lunches are taco salad, Big Mac salad, or 5oz rotisserie chicken meat with a steamed veggie."
keto,"It's part of the chicken's diet.  Monogastrics like birds, pigs, humans, etc, basically put the same fatty acids into their adipose cells as they eat.  They don't produce much of their own fat unlike ruminants.  Chickens are fed a diet that is high in cheap fats like corn and soybean oils, which go straight into their own body tissue."

keto,"My doc was pretty good with info about Keto and IF, and she said not to worry very much about LDL (or even the Total Cholesterol) as long as the HDL levels are high as well. 

That said, your HDL is \_very\_ low. Exercise is the best way to force your body to produce its own HDL cholesterol (although I've seen conflicting reports of whether high or low intensity exercise is better for HDL). Also, it's a good idea to supplement with some healthy fats such as fish oil (look for ones with high DHA and EPA content).  

It's also possible dropping that much weight in a few months could be messing with your hormones, which can sometimes cause cholesterol issues. Hopefully you can find a doctor that is a little more open to Keto and then try to get tested again in 6-9 months to see what your levels are."
keto,"Oh heck yeah, I'd rather eat breast meat anyway. I just was under the impression that thighs were ""better""... No one ever mentioned the omega 6 aspect. Is it naturally occurring or is it based on the chicken's diet?"
keto,"Feeling full is so strange for us that we forgotten how it feels, it feels like a queeziness in your gut, carb addict mostly have too much dopamine to receive it's signal,  now that you're off carb you finally feel what being satieted feels like, it's that sick feeling, but it doesn't have to be strong as fellow commenters mentioned you need to eat slower and maybe smaller portions and as soon as you start to feel that signal, stop eating, you'll be set for the next day if you'd like... Since your body will use your own fat once you go through your food and thus you'll lose weight faster...

keto,"I always have issues with nausea with keto / lc.  

I find selzer water helps.

Also you don't mention veggies.  The low carb veggies are really helpful. 

And. Although good fats are good, sometimes your appetite doesn't catch up to your digestion.  You may be eating beyond what your body wants, even though you enjoy it while eating.  Try eating quite slowly and adding in higher fiber, low-carb veggies. (Ie, any above-ground green veggies.)  These help space out the fats in your digestion so they do not hit all at once and make you nauseous.

Ginger tea is helpful too. 

Also electrolytes as mentioned.  I sometimes resort to alka selzer and/or pepto bismol chews for bad nausea."

keto,"What do you mean by a low day? Do you mean like mentally sad? Or you're struggling with maintaining the diet? Either way I have an answer for both: 

You HAVE to constantly be reminding yourself that what you are doing is one of the most difficult things you ever encounter in your life (for me at least) and you have to commend yourself for doing so well. Acknowledging that it is difficult makes it that much more applaudable. Understand that the journey takes time and the low days you experience are completely normal. You're gonna feel down, you're gonna feel cravings. IT IS OKAY. And forgive yourself if you slip up once, but make sure to not let it get worse than a slip up. Because I did and if I didn't I would have reached my goal weight already :)

keto,"That's being debated honestly.  I'm not sure.  Some people say that linoleic acid itself is dangerous, others that it becomes dangerous through the industrial processes used to refine it from seeds. Personally I only avoid the seed oil and enjoy pork and chicken fat"
keto,"Piggybacking - is the omega 6 in chicken just as dangerous as the omega 6 in veg oils? Im keto for AI management and I was debating on cutting out chicken as a possible trigger for me.

*Gonna research myself but curious to hear your thoughts!"
keto,You may want to look into carnivore... that‚Äôs what helped me
keto,Congratulations
keto,"Kudos to you for holding strong! Banana bread requires extra will power lol. And thanks, everyone put it extra effort to keep things safe while still enjoying seeing each other again."
keto,"Don't forget SPAM. Fry some up in a pan while toasting a split almond flour bun in some butter, add a piece or two of Swiss cheese and enjoy."
keto,"The blood glucose and insulin swings eating modern carbs is very detrimental to mental health and binge eaters.

Sugar is a drug.   And starch is just sugar. 

Neither are proper human food.

What you eat determines if you'll binge.   For instance, it is easy to binge on chocolate and almost impossible to binge on fish."
keto,"Where are the vegetables? 
Oh, and try nuts, they give you dopamine :)"
keto,"Me, I knew. When I have to do a forward fold in yoga I can't help noticing my fat little feet. Every time. I've definitely lost fat off my fingers as well. They feel so much thinner now."
keto,Put them in the pantry section!
keto,"I love my Renpho, even if I don't always love what it says. I appreciate that it shows me more than my weight so im not frustrated when it doesn't show a loss. It shows other changes like an increase in muscle mass."
keto,Have you read the sub's FAQ located in the sidebar?  How are your electrolytes?  Maybe you just need to power through the carb/sugar withdrawal.... maybe a little more variation in your meals and less cheese?
keto,"Yeah I‚Äôll see, i was using coconut oil up until 3 weeks ago. This is definitely frustrating lol"
keto,Definitely try the FODMAP diet.   It is very similar to Keto but more specific to abdominal bloating and gas.
keto,Same here
keto,"Thank you!!! And yeah unfortunately my MD seems to just be against keto/low-carb as a whole, so I‚Äôm looking for someone else"
keto,I would just ditch the crappy sweeteners as i don't see any point in them. by consuming sweet stuff you are only making nonsweet stuff taste crappier.
keto,"üòÇüòÇ thank you, truly! Im on the search now, and kudos to you as well, keep spreading knowledge and keep on being great!"
keto,"Read these, and then read them again. They will clear up any and all contradictory information.

keto,"I was on a contract that put me on graveyard shift for about 3 months. I found I could have a nice big meal to start off my day around 6 PN and then a protein shake around 1 AM and I was good for the day. Didn‚Äôt have any problem sticking to keto, but sleeping during the day was a challenge."
keto,"Elimination diet. I did GAPS, it's hard, but it produces results. I do a low fiber keto now. It's great for my GI problems. I get IBS D and have for a long time. I am sensitive to nightshades and fiber. I get it. Living with GI problems suck. I do keto because sugar makes my mood irregular and I like the weight loss. I would try elimination first though."
keto,"I went out on a limb and brought it before I read your comment. Sometimes I'm cautious about Amazon with many reviews, but I think it'd be hard to rig 130,000+ reviews. From what I see you're correct as well Thank you friend."
keto,"Great thing about keto is it‚Äôs like those drunk bumps in the road. You done know if you messed up because your body will tell you. 

Well I hope you two work things out and become friends again."
keto,r/FODMAPS
keto,"Maybe it's the avocado oil that's high in unsaturated fats. You could see if changing it to a saturated fat like Coconut oil or butter/ghee helps.  I'm no expert on the matter, but i find that saturated fats make me feel a lot better than unsaturated fats like olive oil/avocado oil."
keto,"The only harmful effects they are worried about is the effects on their wallets. Big Food wants to keep selling you their sugar products which make you fat and sick. Then Big Pharma wants to come along and sell you statins and insulin and other drugs to cover up some of the side effects, but of course not to treat the cause.

That's why you constantly see those stories coming out every other day."
keto,"Exactly, pretty much this is the foundation of Paleo, eating what we ate before agriculture came along, which introduced grains en masse into our diets. 

The bottom line is we don't need grains, bread, pasta or cereal in our diets. They are mostly nutrition less and we can get all the fibre we need from vegetables and the occasional fruit."
keto,"Eggs are very very keto friendly.

Peanuts need counting because they can push you over.  Dairy... well butter and heavy cream are highly keto friendly, only need to watch carbs on the Heavy cream if you go for a lot of it... however milk/half-half/whey cheeses etc can be a problem.

BUT it certainly is true that dairy and nuts are common difficulties for many on keto.

EGGS however.  As long as you Do include the yolks, eggs are nearly a perfect food on keto.  If a person likes eggs and does not have an individual problem with them, EGGs are perfect keto food."
keto,"I can‚Äôt speak to how accurate all the ‚Äúmeasurements‚Äù are (it measures you body fat percentage, water percentage, bone density, etc). But I will say the weight it super accurate and the other measurements do seem so hold some merit because they‚Äôre different for everyone and seem to consistently make sense. I also love that it has a section in the app to track your measurements, too! I would definitely recommend it."
keto,You don't have to eat a lot of meat for keto. There are keto vegans and vegetarians.
keto,Very handsome!  Good for you!
keto,Lol that‚Äôs the toughest part. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm averaging around 7-800 calories a day now because my usual foods are gone
keto,"Nice Renpho scale, the app has been amazing!"
keto,Great tips.
keto,But I don't want to lose weight üò≠
keto,"I was just going to say, your before pic looks like puffy alcohol face. Obviously, additional weight all over. But too much alcohol makes me super puffy, even if I'm eating low carb. Congrats to you, you've done great. And you're catching bad habits young."
keto,It is mostly a hormone and body chemistry thing.  Eating carbs makes you hungry by releasing insulin and the resultant blood sugar swings.
keto,"This is the only place on the internet I‚Äôve found I tear up with excitement for complete strangers, all I know of you is this post, but that‚Äôs enough for me to feel incredible pride, and know you‚Äôre fucking killing it! Keep up the good work, you‚Äôre on your way to more, and even more incredible, successes!"
keto,"Your progress is remarkable and inspirational-- congratulations! Question: You mention that for a part of your journey, you were off keto. Was that during the beginning or current? Did you notice any difference in your rate of weight loss when you were off keto? Also, just wondering if you had any adverse effects on keto which made you abandon it?

OK, that's actually 3 questions. Asking because I'm doing keto and managed to lose 60 lbs., with no adverse health results that I'm aware of. You're a real pro at this and I'd love to hear your thoughts. Again, congratulations and best of luck as you progress toward your goal!"
keto,"I did under 20g of keto for about five months. I stopped though and gain the weight I lost plus an extra 20. 

For me it‚Äôs too difficult to maintain. I just don‚Äôt like meat that much. It‚Äôs a huge amount of meat to eat (or seems like it to me, an ex-vegetarian of 20 years). 

I now shoot for 40 net carbs and very infrequently I‚Äôll settle at 45. I fall in and out of ketosis this way. I‚Äôm obviously riding a line. 

However, life is muuuuuuuch easier. I can see myself maintaining this for much longer. It‚Äôs easier on my wallet as well since I can have (carefully planned) chickpeas, lentils, etc... 

I haven‚Äôt weighed myself for this new carb goal. I‚Äôm trying to weigh only once a month to help me focus on the things in my life that need changing ‚Äî planning meals, planning grocery orders, resisting cravings, etc. In the end my weight will get to where it needs to be as long as I log everything and stay within my caloric goal (around 1500)."
keto,"Such amazing progress, congrats!!! Also this app looks so detailed, would you mind sharing what it is?"
keto,"Just jumping on this thread to say yes, that's the general idea. Get the protein you need. Keep your carbs under 20 net grams. Use fat as you like - keeping in mind your overall calories. You can always have more protein or fat if you're hungry, just not excess carbs.

Once you have the concept in place, this is quite a simple way to eat.

It's great you're doing this. Lots of folks here have started out big like you and made huge improvements to their weight and health. You're doing a good thing for yourself.

PS Read the FAQ carefully and get your electrolytes sorted as well."
keto,"I should have said behaviourally unsustainable. What I meant was that it is most likely impossible to maintain a 20-50g daily carb limit for the rest of your life. Eventually you're gonna have a corn chip or a piece of whole grain toast. I know a handful of people who lost a bunch of weight with keto then slowly gained some back (two guys gained it all back) when they tried to re-introduce just a bit of whole grains. It snowballs from there. Of course it would be much easier for everyone if we weren't surrounded by mountains of cheap carbs. Anyway, if you can maintain a keto diet forever then more power to you."
keto,I still have my gallbladder but have had many gallbladder stone attacks - they are the worst :(. I went on Ursodeoxycholic Acid tablets for about two years to dissolve them as my case fit the criteria where this form of treatment may work. I am now eating keto and it's worked well. I think for me my attacks were triggered more by junk than whole food fats.
keto,"For me depression, insomnia, fatigue/lethargy and migraines. When not doing keto I get migraines that last for days at a time."
keto,"Wow. 

Yep, that‚Äôs all I got."
keto,"Alchohol was the killer for me. Cutting it completely was huge, haven‚Äôt touched it since"
keto,I knew I was fat adapted when I could skip a meal without getting weak and shaky.  It means your body has made the shift to being able to easily switch to burning body fat and not keep demanding carbs.
keto,"Look at Jason Fung's fasting protocols. They attack the problem from a different angle and are less restrictive.

I love bread, too. One of my favorite foods. But I don't eat it."
keto,"A lot of people think as they get older all the extra puffiness is simply due to age, they forget the neglect of diet and alcohol plays a major part and some effects can be reversed by altering your lifestyle... as shown by the OP here."
keto,"Either option is healthy. What's best for you will probably be what you can sustain. Cutting sugar and radically reducing refined carbs (ie grains) is a good route to health, no matter what. No, eating LC will not make you low energy and grumpy. It will more likely even out energy dips and dives, as keto does."
keto,"The point of the keto diet is that it puts your body in a state where your liver is making ketones from fat and also making glucose. Drinking ketones doesn't do that.

Most of the ketones supplements have few ketones in them because they are very expensive to make and taste terrible."
keto,Congratulations!!! Do you mind sharing how the 8 months off keto compared to the time on keto?
keto,"Nice jawline success, congratulations!
And you're wearing your seat belt now, very considerate ;-)"
keto,In the beginning I would get nauseous while adapting to low carb.  It goes away in time.   Read up on electrolytes and ketoade.  Many people find that helps a lot.
keto,"It's funny you say this. Whenever someone asks how it's possible to live without the joys of pasta and bread etc, I always say that I've already had enough in my life to fill it to the end. I packed in all that ""joy"" into the first half of my life. Lol. And of course, it didn't really make me happy."
keto,"Like this one but cut out the Stevia and cinnamon obviously.

keto,Congrats!!
keto,"They can be high while losing weight.

or maybe your carbs aren't as low was you think."
keto,Looking good dude!
keto,"Nice üëç.

Ditch = insulin resistance"
keto,"I doubt you'll find recipes that do that. Though there are definitely low carb/keto recipes that give you the per portion breakdown.

The easiest way to eat when you're starting (I'm guessing you're a bit new at this) is meat + veg + healthy fat. If you like to cook in bulk and eat leftovers, it's easy enough to do this way too. I generally have a variety of cooked and raw veggies in the fridge (for salads) and then maybe chicken thighs, steak, taco beef, meatloaf, bolognese sauce, etc.

I do cook a lot of keto/low carb dishes (like chicken curry or chicken divan or eggplant lasagne), and at this point all I do is watch portion size. Each meal is composed of mostly protein with added veg and fat. I don't measure it all exactly, but then I never have. I've lost all my weight doing lazy keto - watching portion size and only mentally counting carbs. 

Since you're trying to lose weight, you really only need to measure protein and overall calories, so long as you're eating low carb veg. So yah, keep it simple! Each meal does not have to have an exact composition that matches your macros."
keto,"you look great! any extra exercise? hoping this happens to me when I start keto again , i‚Äôm 197 gw 165  ( i was 186 post keto/ pre quarantine ) . Last time my tummy wouldn‚Äôt leave üò™ but i‚Äôve been eating bad so hopefully the junk weight drops fast"
keto,Great job.. what is the app you are using to track progress
keto,"Some donair / doner meat is filled with bread crumbs.  

As your microbiome changes, so does your tolerance of some foods."
keto,You must have been in misery
keto,Great job!
keto,It took me 3 months to do all the tests and then find someone willing to take it out even when the tests came back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but I was in agony. The surgeon was appalled when taking it out because there weren‚Äôt stones but the gallbladder itself was covered in scar tissue and had been dying for a while.
keto,You are someone to look up to! I admire your dedication...to your health!
keto,Had mine out almost 30 years ago after suffering terribly for 2 years. It affects your health so much and can become life threatening.  Zero regret from having it removed.
keto,I had to search for a doctor willing to take mine out after the first one didn‚Äôt take me seriously. OP should do their due diligence in finding a doctor / surgeon that is on the same page.
keto,"Read the FAQ here. It explains how to avoid the keto ""flu"" (supplement electrolytes), how to calculate your macros, and how keto works. If you want to lose weight, you'll have to eat at a calorie deficit. But just cutting carbs will get you half way there - you'll eat healthier food and it's generally easier to eat at a deficit (your hunger will be reduced) without all the carbs."
keto,"We eat mostly meat and vegetables and we keep fruit for the kid, mainly bananas because that's what they like. We buy the meat in bulk from a restaurant supplier. Chicken is around a dollar a lb. Hotdogs for the kid is $10 for 120 all beef franks. Bacon is like $2 lb right now. We have to buy in bulk. But we got a foodsaver and split the food up into portion size bags and have a freezer in the garage. We eat a lot of onions, peppers, celery, spinach and some tomatoes.  

I can feed a family of 3 for around 150 a month. I use coupons and ibotta to help me get down to that price as well. If I find a good deal I stock up for six month supply as long as the best buy isn't soon. 

We also buy veggies for as low as possible and cut them up and freeze them. So if I can get some peppers for cheap I make veggie bags where the peppers and onion are cut up and  ready to be thrown in a pan to cook. We buy a lot of discount veggies and have them cut up and frozen and ready to thaw and eat. We keep corn on hand for the kid as they love airfried corn with bay seasoning. Snacks like chips we can't keep in the kitchen as kid eats it all in one sitting. We let them ask for chips and then they get one portion size which is 8 chips. Same with cookies. They get three cookies. They keep saying its not fair but they are not capable of controlling themselves around junk food so we have to regulate it for them. 

Ibotta and fetch and similar programs can be your best friend. I can easily cut my bill by half just getting rebates on what I buy. I often buy things that are on there. So if I need crackers and ritz cheese crackers are almost free compared to goldfish after my rebate then I get the ritz. It does make my shopping take twice as long to find the deals and reference whats is on ibotta and what I have digital store coupons for but the savings are worth it."
keto,When are you having your gallbladder removed and is your doctor suggesting weight loss first? If you aren't satisfied with your doctor get a new one.
keto,"high blood pressure is related to sodium, but not dietary sodium. High insulin levels holds onto sodium in your kidneys. When the insulin levels lower, it releases the water and sodium. That's why you pee a lot in the beginning and lose all that water weight."
keto,"I‚Äôm not dogmatic about it, life happens. For example a few weeks ago I was out on a construction site with a client after which he wanted to go grab lunch, I wasn‚Äôt going to lecture the client about benefits of keto and fasting lol. We went to a Mexican place I got a fajita plate and only ate the protein. And then went back to my regularly scheduled programming  the next day.

After the years I‚Äôve been doing this what I realized is that this diet (I guess most diets, exercise regimens and lifestyle changes for that matter) could be viewed as something akin to steering a ship. If you want to change direction of the ship you have to do multiple turns of the wheel and hold it for a while before it starts turning. So yes getting yourself on track heading the ‚Äúright‚Äù direction takes a bit of effort. But after you‚Äôre on the right track one or two ‚Äúoff days‚Äù every few months isn‚Äôt going to be catastrophic. You just want your ‚Äúgood days‚Äù to far out weight your ‚Äúbad days‚Äù. 

For regular gatherings, (pre COVID) most of my friends and family know about my diet luckily (if you can call it that lol) I‚Äôm diabetic so it‚Äôs easy to explain away my ‚Äúweird‚Äù eating habits by blaming that so there‚Äôs usually some sort of low carb or just protein option available."
keto,Oh I fogor about TJmaxx. Maybe I should try there when I have time
keto,"true, true"
keto,üòÑüòÑ
keto,"I don't know what's in doner. What makes it junk food? Isn't it meat and spices? I've never had it but I've thought of making it.

Related - place near me makes amazing chicken shawarma. I get a take-out box of just the chicken and dress it up with tzatziki and hot sauce. Awesome."
keto,"Do not bump up your fat and calories, you‚Äôre fine where you‚Äôre at. You want your body to burn its own fat, so eating excessive amounts of fat is counterproductive to that goal. Hence why, like others have said, protein is your main focus/goal. 

A warning about Fung - he preaches ‚Äúcalories don‚Äôt matter‚Äù, but they absolutely do. Just FYI."
keto,"hey that's true! but it also helps the immune system, regardless"
keto,"You may find that if you start with LC and stick with it for awhile, you will be able to move to keto later if necessary or wanted. Your body may need to adjust."
keto,"Google diet doctor dot com gallstones.

All weight loss risks gallstones and gallbladder attacks.

Low fat weight loss is the worst for gallstones as the gallbladder dumps its contents when it detects fat.

You should consider surgical removal of your gallbladder if you have ongoing pain with meals.  

I keep my gallbladder healthy by working it - by eating fat."
keto,"I‚Äôve noticed this before.  I believe your gut microbiome becomes used to non-carb foods and a sudden dose of carbs is hard to handle.

I also seem to have an inflammation response to sugar and carbs here days.  Too much and my body swells up and my joints hurt."
keto,First off I wouldn't set a goal weight and time. I would first start working on the good habits and the weight loss will come when it is ready. There's already the stress of your diet overhaul.
keto,"A low carb doctor said something once that helped me. It depends on how far in the ditch you are. If your ""car"" is barely off the road, you may only need low carb. If your car is in the ditch and stuck, the lower your carbs need to be to get back on the road. Once you're on the road, you can add a few more in and see if you stay on the road."
keto,That's awesome. Congrats!
keto,I would not want to need to follow multiple multi step recipes a day. That‚Äôs probably the first problem.
keto,"My IBS has improved and I no longer get bloating and stomach pains from eating certain things


My Chronic Fatigue improved enough that I could stop drinking a daily can of energy drink


My Ehlers Danlos has improved somewhat. I still get back pain and other pains but its reduced"
keto,"Yea, I was partly hoping for the latter solution, lol.

I've been trying to isolate possible issues, thanks for your suggestions"
keto,"Just a note, even folks eating low carb rather than keto are prone to electrolyte imbalance. Supplementation is important either way. Don‚Äôt wait until heart palpitations hit you, proactively make ketoade in the morning and sip it throughout the day. I‚Äôve been doing this for 3 years."
keto,"Absolutely. I eat my breakfast around 7am and then I don't receive a break at work for lunch until about 12:30pm. I used to fiend for that meal mid-day and get all shaky and jittery if I couldn't eat ASAP but now I am much more patient and no longer in a rush to eat. Same goes for dinner, my husband is an absolute machine (the man eats two meals for dinner and NO, he does not eat keto) and he's reminding me to sit down for dinner around 5/6pm depending. 

Freedom, baby!! 

I also used to be an avid snacker and now I keep 1-2 crunchy keto options in the house in case  I need a fix but it's rarely I overeat them."
keto,"I'm gonna re-examine electrolytes, I wasn't worried about potassium, I try to eat spinach and avacado everyday

I have been using ketoaid, i had been drinking straight lite-salt+magnesium because I was worried about sweeteners. Good info though, good things to keep in mind. Potassium is scary, I read keto potassium horror stories, lol.

Thanks"
keto,"My body fat percentage dropped 3% in the past week and people at my job are absolutely astounded at the changes in my body. Scale reflects only a pound lost this week, but I‚Äôm now at 30% body fat, 15% less than when I started measuring a couple of months ago. Lean body weight up 24 pounds. I‚Äôm learning to not take the number on the scale as gospel. I feel amazing."
keto,"Ah yeah when you're a few months in thats alright because by then you have control of yourself - I plan on going strict keto for Jan &amp; Feb and then in March (maybe April depends on lockdowns tbh) introduce a morning bowl of porridge so I can start running again properly!

On the gut bacteria side, I'll take your word for it :P"
keto,"I prioritize micronutrients first, starting with the micronutrients that I've had trouble with recently that are unpleasant to supplement so I'd rather get it from food (like magnesium and other minerals).

I'm doing a high dose magnesium experiment and feeling really good when I do (less anxiety, less fatigue, less hunger). but it takes about 1400 calories to get as much magnesium as I want from food, and my goal on most days is 1500, not a lot of wiggle room.

I aim for less than 20 carbs but don't worry if I'm over on protein.

""meals"" are honestly more of a special occasion kind of thing to me because I'm so busy fixing my magnesium deficiency.  I usually go either over on calories or under on magnesium when I have to do an actual meal for social reasons. I'd rather be over on calories here and there instead of under on micronutrients so that's usually what I do."
keto,"Congrats! ""Twotopia"" is my next goal on the path and I'm not far off now."
keto,"I've considered allergies, I use stevia as an alternative sweetener, which I learned at some point could be linked to a ragweed allergy, but I have it off keto with no ill effects. Could be something else as well, I'll keep aware of the possibility.

I haven't had blood tastes, I'll try it out when I have the resources if the issue persists"
keto,"Apparently keto is actually good for mental clarity and a lot of people say their ‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù lifted when they started it. I did not experience any mental change (I don‚Äôt think I ever had ‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù) but I definitely don‚Äôt think keto reduces mental sharpness. PS, I am also on 20g net carbs a day."
keto,"If you resume the habits that gained your weight in the first place, you will absolutely regain that weight. That is true for any way of eating."
keto,Hahahaha braver than me!
keto,Why would it be vitamins on keto but not off?
keto,Some nightshades were a problem for me and I was eating a lot more of them on keto. Good luck getting it sorted out.
keto,"Agreed. I make chocolate-coconut ‚Äúbark‚Äù with unsweetened chocolate, erythritol-based sweetener, coconut flakes, almond meal and some coconut butter. I eat a bit of it pretty much every day. It tastes like candy but it‚Äôs really not."
keto,"I do it just for those reasons. I don't have much weight to lose.

Mentally I feel much better once I get into ketosis.

Physically, it takes like 2 weeks after the flu which I always have despite anything I do.

20g or less strict here."
keto,Congrats on your progress. What a huge loss in a short time period! What‚Äôs your carb limit? I can see that being strict has worked for you! How often have you been working out? Do you do substitutes or are you cutting out the Atkins treats etc?
keto,Maybe it‚Äôs not for you. It‚Äôs not for everyone. And you have to stay on it pretty much forever or the weight comes back.
keto,"This video is really interesting.

 It talks about glucose vs ketones for bacterial vs viral infections.  Basically, it says that we need glucose to fight viral infections.  Now, we know that we still have glucose when on keto, but perhaps more is better?  I would go with what folks are saying here: Eat whatever feels best to your body."
keto,Guilty about telling them no snacks. Not giving the $10. I wasn‚Äôt clear enough. :)
keto,"Not sure, I'll look into it, seems unlikely as I eat a fair amount of eggs, but some of the symptoms of deficiency  line up so I'll keep it in mind, thanks for your suggestion,"
keto,"That's fantastic, great job !"
keto,"Thankyou so much for commenting! Did you use a macro calculator and were you hungry at first? I am studying currently and can never concentrate when I am hungry! I have heard about keto flu as well and I worry about that too! Sorry for asking questions I am a little scared and I really want to still be able to live while loosing weight (go to the gym, study &amp; not feel deprived). Thanks again !"
keto,Wow!!! Congrats. You lost a whole person. That is amazing and so inspiring. I too am on the journey to two-land. Now I‚Äôm going to get up and go exercise bc of you!
keto,"What about social activities? Say you ate lunch, then your friend invited you to dinner that afternoon?"
keto,That is awesome! Congratulations!!!!
keto,Your body doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúresist‚Äù it. It just upset your stomach.
keto,I don't even remember when was the last time I drank coffee
keto,No I am sedentary
keto,Getting to a normal weight from a not so very high starting weight?
keto,"Great! I hope to do it for life after my first few attempts throughout the past few years. I've had enough sugar for a lifetime. Just remember to be kind to yourself and if you get off track, to get right back on."
keto,"I have only ever tried IF, 16/8 something like that maybe 20/4 on more extreme days but never actually tried a full on fast. I just know I need to do something to get myself back to just the 300's (and here everyone is chasing onederland)"
keto,I always check the tag on my coffee for this exact reason.
keto,You have spoken
keto,"My go to is Cold Brew, light ice(for more caffeine duh), light heavy cream, sugar free cinnamon dulce.  Sometimes if I‚Äôm close on carbs I ask for the heavy cream on the side just to be safe.  If it‚Äôs pretty cold out I‚Äôll do whatever regular brewed coffee they have with the same setup."
keto,I feel ya man. My best advice is to be aware that your body will want to process the alcohol before any calories.

keto,You can do it!! Keep up the good work!
keto,"Look up edamame spaghetti and fettuccini by Liviva, (they're available on Amazon). Easily the best pasta alternative I've discovered, taste and texture wise. They're quite high in fiber and not zero carbs like the konjac noodles (\~5 net carbs per serving, 4 servings per bag), but you'll be hard pressed to distinguish them from real pasta."
keto,"Thanks!
I've been intermittent fasting for a long time, so stopping that now would be hard for me."
keto,"Read the FAQ in the sidebar. See Keto flu.

Also, use the calculator there to calculate your macros.

keto,Amazon has tons of keto snacks that you can probs get delivered
keto,"Walmart has this zero sugar beef jerky. I think it's really good. 0 carbs, decent amount of protein, and you could crush the whole bag for like ~400 calories. Also pork rinds are solid. Different cheeses make good low carb snacks. Pickels, olives, Quest protein bars, almonds."
keto,Also never add ANY thickening agent to hot food . Desolve in cold water 1st then add.
keto,I don‚Äôt know if someone already asked this! Please forgive me there is a lot of comments and I am at work! But what do your meals look like?? I started keto this week and I am finding that I am so very hungry! I really just want to feel full again! Any suggestions would be amazing!

Air dried kale is good once you get used to it. Sorry, another store bought item, but it‚Äôs one of my favorites. That and mooncheese/ cheese wisps/parm crisps. That you can should be able to make it since it‚Äôs just melting cheese."

keto,"As someone who always rewards with food, I loved that celebrate!!!"
keto,"Yep. Fatty foods have never been my go-to, but I handled it way better the first time starting keto (yikes, almost 10 years ago) than I did on my most recent attempt to get back on the wagon (a year ago). It's partly a texture thing (I'm even more averse to fatty pieces of meat now for some reason), and partly a psychological food limitation thing - it's easier for me to avoid getting glutened on keto, which is a perk, but I'm also allergic to a bunch of things (like nuts and certain vegetables) that would otherwise add some variety to my meals."
keto,I hate when they do that üôÑ
keto,Log what you eat and look at the carb calculations on what you ate. Start pulling the carbs down by cutting the source by half. It won‚Äôt feel so overwhelming that way. Good luck

keto,"Don't wait until February 1. Start now.

Read all of the info in the sub.

Pick up some electrolytes for supplementation.

Keep it simple. At your weight, all you have to do is eat protein + non-starchy veg + fat of your choice. Cut out sugar, fruit, starchy veg and grains. Eat everything else. Don't worry about quantity at first.

Approach this as a lifestyle, not a diet. It's a way of eating. It may feel restrictive at first, but it will give you your freedom - from bad habits, from being fat, from being sick, from feeling lethargic, from metabolic disease, from future diabetes.

People say that great art comes out of thoughtful constraints - the size of a canvas, the length of a musical piece, the condensation of poetic language. I think a great life happens this way too.

After reading the FAQ here,  I highly suggest you also look into intermittent fasting.  It's not required for keto,  but the strategies combined are a great one-two punch for weight loss. Keto helps with appetite too, like... a lot."
keto,"Well while it‚Äôs possible not to break ketosis at 50mg, most keto-ers stick under 20 net grams. But it is totally possible for you to being in ketosis while eating 50 net grams a day.  Whatever your limit is, as long as you stay under it, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you eat."

keto,I hear that! If I gain one more lb my back is going to collapse. üòÇ
keto,That's great!!!!
keto,I thought that fat was the goal and carbs were the limit? Doesn't not consuming enough fat push you out of ketosis and into gluconeogenesis?
keto,"Congratulations!  I lost 30 lb and I got mine down in 8 months as well and I am no longer pre-diabetic! My doctor never urged me to lose weight, but put me on pills!"
keto,"It's hard to grasp at first, but think of it this way; fiber is a carbohydrate that doesn't affect your blood sugar. That's why you can subtract it; it's technically a carbohydrate, but doesn't count towards the limit you want to place on yourself. There's a lot of science behind it that I am not familiar enough with to explain, but that's the gist.
If a meal has 15 carbs in it, but 5 of those are fiber, those don't count, and the meal has 10 net carbs (in general, though some foods have ingredients that still affect blood sugar, like Aldi's Keto bread). 15 carbs - 5 fiber = 10 net carbs."
keto,Congrats!üçæ
keto,Me too!
keto,"Omelettes! I like adding a bit of spinach and feta in mine! You can add higher carb veggies for the carb eaters! Another quick and cheap meal I like to make is buffalo wings , I get a bulk pack of wings and freeze the ones I don‚Äôt use. 
Tacos are a good option, I make a salad instead of using a tortilla. Add toppings like chopped bell pepper or jalape√±os, sour cream , hot sauce and tomatoes! Avocado is good as well , but they can be pricy. No tortillas needed! You can use lettuce leaves as a tortilla if you want , but i prefer chopped. 

For veggies I like to roast broccoli with a little olive oil and garlic , my partner is lactose intolerant as well so we avoid using lots of butter/cream and high lactose cheeses. I also like roasting cauliflower with a bit of olive oil and ground ginger , it‚Äôs delicious! You can get frozen as well.
For a bread replacement I like the mission low carb tortillas, they are often on sale and taste very similar to real tortillas, they are a bit thicker though. 

For snacks that are easy to grab , I like almonds or pumpkin seeds , I occasionally have pork rinds but I try to avoid them as i find I can easily binge on them personally. I also love pickles or cucumber slices , especially with a little lime or lemon juice squeezed on top. 
A square of dark chocolate is good for sweet cravings , I also like having a few strawberries. My partner like putting a bit of unsweetened coconut cream on his , it‚Äôs super delicious and tastes a bit like cheesecake."

keto,"I find once I have toughed out the first couple of no-carb days, I no longer hear the cookies calling my name.

On the second day of my keto journey, my son who lives with me baked a dozen blueberry muffins. They smelled divine, but then I remembered that I have eaten blueberry muffins so they aren't such a novelty. I can have a blueberry muffin anytime I want, so passing on them this time wasn't going to mean blueberry muffins would be lost to me forever. Also, that stuff only tastes good while it's in your mouth. 2 minutes afterward, the joy is gone."
keto,2 grams won't make much difference but that's why I count total carbs.  Net is too misleading.
keto,"This is awesome! Great work! Keep going
 You got this!"
keto,"I have to be strict. It's not the first time you give in to temptation that's the easiest to slip on. It's the second and third and fourth.

If you find yourself tempted, discipline. I went off the rails during the pandemic from March through August. Gained back 50 lbs by giving in on a stressful day and just having pizza ""once"" then going off the rails after 18 months of strict keto. Took my 6 months to regroup. But it also took me just 5 months to lose all the weight I gained, and am down 3lbs from when I went off the rails. I don't want to do that again, so nope. There are cookies, cupcakes, ice cream, pasta etc all around me and none of them taste as good as I feel wearing slim jeans, walking 5-10 miles daily and having energy."

keto,If you're only in 10 days you are still in transition..  Don't worry about calories for now.  Just keep those carbs below 20.  It gets easy when you're fat adapted.  I kept hard boiled eggs in the fridge (still do) and if I get munchy I just eat those.
keto,The fat is to keep you full so you can eat less calories.
keto,I've been experiencing the same thing with my family recently. One trick I've used is to hide any foods that trigger me so they're out of sight.
keto,This isn't a practical concern if doing keto for weight loss. You can eat a lot of protein and would almost certainly already be significantly over calories before this was a problem.
keto,"Omg thank you, I‚Äôm not alone ! I‚Äôve tried multiple flavors, I just can‚Äôt do it ü§Æ"

keto,"It means that you need to eat 70g or higher of protein and do not go over your fat macro , you can even go way below it. If you are doing keto for weightloss, you don't need to eat a bunch of fat because you want your body to burn your bodys  excess fat, not consumed fat. Does that make sense?"

I am not a native english speaker so this phrase hunts me because in my language... Well it doesn't makes sense.

Does this mean for example that if my Macro is 130g fat, 70g protein, I have to eat max 130 fat and min 70 protein or the opposite? Or just reach my macros?"

keto,"It's fine. 

Be aware some keto protein shake powders such as slim fast keto protein powder have powered mct oils. This makes them very fatty and low in protein. To fix this I use 1 scoop isopure and 2 scoop slim fast keto and it's fine or just stick to isopure entirely."
keto,"Congratulations on your work on your addiction! That is huge - this random reddit stranger is proud of you. 

I've been around enough people working through addiction recovery to notice the trend that a fair few of them replaced their substance of choice with sugar. If that could apply to you as well, consider asking your therapist to help you with the switch to keto. It may be more emotionally complicated if sugar is a stand-in for another substance. 

Either way - I'm proud of you. You got this. One day at a time."

keto,"**[Gluconeogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluconeogenesis)**

Gluconeogenesis (GNG) is a metabolic pathway that results in the generation of glucose from certain non-carbohydrate carbon substrates. It is a ubiquitous process, present in plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, and other microorganisms. In vertebrates, gluconeogenesis takes place mainly in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the cortex of the kidneys. It is one of two primary mechanisms - the other being degradation of glycogen (glycogenolysis) - used by humans and many other animals to maintain blood glucose levels, avoiding low levels (hypoglycemia).

If I were you, I would not even think about substituting sugars right away. Keto is not about that. It's about eating protein and fat, and eating less than 20 g of net carbs. The protein is for your muscles. The fat keeps you satiated and makes you feel less hungry for very long periods of time (once your body is adapted to it)."

Keto for weight loss must be done in grams not %"
keto,You saved your own life! Absolutely inspiring:)
keto,"&gt; A proper keto diet is 70% fat, 20-25% protein and 5% carbs.

No. Your macros should be in grams. Percentages are next to worthless. Your need for proteins should primarily be based on lean body mass, not on caloric intake.

* If one eats too few carbs, the body can make the glucose and ketones it needs to provide energy for the body. There are no essential carbs.
* If one eats too few proteins, the body can get what it needs by breaking down muscle tissue. Not good.
* If one eats too few fats, the body can get what it needs from stored body fat. A good thing if one is trying to lose weight.

You should probably take a look at the group FAQ.

The vegetables don't satiate the way that meat does, but if you enjoy them and want to eat them, try to consume them with a fat. Saute them with olive oil or butter, dip them in sour cream or ranch. The fat will make them more delicious and filling."
keto,"I totally rice broccoli all the time in my blender. I make lots of keto Asian food and use it all the time instead of cauliflower. I do use cauliflower on stews instead of potatoes. I make a killer zuppa toscana soup that replaces potatoes with cauliflower and my kids love it. 

Cauliflower tends to soak up flavors and I can stand it in stuff where it‚Äôs not raw."
keto,This happened to me too back when I started.
keto,I started when I found out I was pre diabetic. My mom is insulin dependent and has lost her teeth and is in terrible health. I didn‚Äôt want to be that way when I‚Äôm her age. I‚Äôm 47 now and was on metformim for my blood sugar and was able to bring my a1c down over 1 point since I started and get completely off the metformin. I lost that 60 pounds in about two months. It was incredible I‚Äôd have never thought it was possible. My sleep apnea is better and no more heart burn. Sometimes I really want pizza and peanut butter cups though! Keto has been surprisingly easy for me to stick too and my body has responded well until the last 30 days. But I think I‚Äôve figured that out since the app wasn‚Äôt recalculating.
keto,"How is that not a viable flour substitute? The end product using coconut flour has slightly fewer net carbs than the end product using almond flour, because you only need a quarter as much coconut flour.

Coconut flour is **very** absorbent. If I had a recipe that called for four cups of almond flour, my substitution would include:

* 1 cup of coconut flour
* Up to 6 additional eggs
* Up to 1 additional cup of liquid"
keto,"&gt;but it‚Äôs all I have to go by for now

the point is it isnt all you have to go by, because you shouldnt be using the data in the first place.  **It does not measure your body fat or lean muscle mass.  it cannot tell you any useful information for this purpose**.  it is literally worthless data, and it is causing problems for you.  stop gathering it, it is a waste of time."
keto,If you know they aren‚Äôt accurate then you are getting concerned over inaccurate(and possibly false) information.
keto,"Hey man, that's bad ass. I'm proud of you champ."
keto,"&gt;I didn‚Äôt weight myself on Monday

so you dont *know* you gained weight, you think you did.  emotion is not fact.  gather the actual data if you want to be able to analyze.

&gt;I tried several keto sticks (and yes I know they can be very inaccurate) and they only showed a trace of ketosis.

its not that they just arent accurate, they do not tell you if you are in ketosis.

&gt;For the record, I‚Äôm following a book of week menus that range from 20g of carbs to 1400-1600 calories per day, though I don‚Äôt always eat every meal because I think the portions are too big.

have you actually vetted that data to confirm the macronutrient content of the meal plan?  have you calculated what your macros should be to see if these meal plans are even a fit for you?


at the end of the day, you get out what you put in.  if you dont put the effort in, you cant really expect the results to come out.  you also didnt gain all the weight in a week, so you arent going to lose it all in a week either.  you need a new plan, as your current one doesnt seem to be working.  I would start with reading, then rereading, then rereading, then rereading the FAQ in the side bar."
keto,"Does any of this look familiiar? If so, something to talk with your doctor about.

keto,"3-4 liters of water. I had to crank it up to counter constipation. Sodium has been changing a bit. I used to eat a lot of cheese and sausage etc. so during those times 6-10 grams a day just from the aforementioned foods, but it really worked up my appetite as i was eating (not before or after necessarily). I would not feel satisfied at all while eating and there was terrible thirst afterwards which i had to wait for hours to quench properly so as not to mess up digestion with water. Currently i'd say maybe 2 teaspoons a day. I do take some with morning water and approximately add 1 tsp with meals. 
I also take plenty of potassium chloride. Calcium &amp; magnesium as well."
keto,I don‚Äôt think I am drinking enough! Def starting to drink 9 cups a day from now
keto,I don‚Äôt pay for it and like I said I know they aren‚Äôt insanely accurate but it‚Äôs all I have to go by for now
keto,"bioimpedance scales do not tell you your body fat % or lean muscle %.  the data you are basing this off of is worthless.  if you are paying for this, you are wasting your money.  if you arent paying for it, you are wasting your time."
keto,how many hours did you fast for leading up to the blood draw?
keto,Congrats!!! Very encouraging and inspiring!
keto,That‚Äôs true. Thanks for the perspective.
keto,"I‚Äôm one week in, and I feel like it‚Äôs going slow as well.  However, I feel totally different in my clothes already. I guess it‚Äôs not just about the scale number, but also about how your body is shifting as well.  I also feel more emotionally even, and not like I need to sleep all the time.  I don‚Äôt know why I quit keto in the first place (well I do... carbs are one hell of a drug).

Keep going!  As will I!"
keto,"I go to 5 Star Nutrition an do the InBody scans. It keeps track of my weight, body fat %, and skeletal muscle mass. I lost 1lb of muscle mass in a week. I know they aren‚Äôt 100% accurate but it‚Äôs all I have to go on for now"
keto,I second this. Grilled cheese is my jam! Also fridge keeping is a life saver. It molds quickly if left out.
keto,"I have tried OMAD and 2MAD as well. I could force myself to eat when i would know it's necessary, but the problem is that i have no clue how much to eat i guess, or what (ie. what foods suit me best and how to get the nutrients i need). I guess this is for me alone to find out.

TY for the answer anyways!"
keto,how do you know you are losing muscle mass?
keto,Natural peanut butter and Smuckers sugar free jelly.
keto,Then would it also scare you that there is more saturated fat in oily fish like sardines than in red meat?  Keto really does go against most of the health recommendations  we have received over the past 50 years.  You kind of have to makes your peace with that :)
keto,"I have been doing that. Used to do OMAD, but i feel it was hard to get enough macros in without digestive issues and often going too low in ketones. Now i've been trying 2MAD with at least 16hrs.

I guess my issue is more with the macro amount. I seem to get low ketones really easily (with like 70-80g protein and 20g carbs). I feel my best when ketones are at &gt;2. After meal drop to say 1.5 or maybe a tad less even is ok. 
Problem with this is that with such restrictions it is hard to anticipate how much i should eat and how to divide it into meals. I am someone who needs to and likes to exercise as well, so too little causes problems as well. 

I don't know. Maybe it's dumb trying to find an answer from here. I guess it's just my own personal issue to waddle through. Thanks for answering though."
keto,better be safe than sorry :) my immune system is weak that's why this kind of stuff scare me a lot
keto,ohh alright
keto,"One thing to double check is your hydration ‚Äî dehydration can do crazy things like cause aversion to food, dizziness and extreme fatigue. 

How much water are you drinking? How much sodium?"
keto,"Are those results from RCTs or population studies?

I'm done basing my decisions  on weak science."
keto,More than you‚Äôd think! Especially in the 50+ pop.
keto,"Nope. Cholesterol in diet and blood cholesterol aren‚Äôt even the same thing. This connection has been debunked for a long time. Heart disease has more to do with low HDL (a kind of blood cholesterol), glucose levels (blood sugar), inflammation, and blood cortisol levels (stress) than dietary cholesterol."
keto,"by egg diet i mean consuming 60 egg in 15 days that's unhealthy...and eggs have been linked to diabetes too, people who consume more than 4 eggs every day have 60 percent chance of getting diabetes"
keto,"The best criterion to use is how they affect you and your progress.  The numbers and math are meaningless if they block your  progress, and if they do not.  Each body responds differently to many nutrients, so your results are what is important, not the opinion of how every body *should* respond."
keto,thank you !
keto,too many eggs cause your cholesterol levels to go up? which results heart disease
keto,r/carnivore are functioning just fine with zero fiber in their diet.
keto,"You could combine it with IF, and use an app like Fastic, Simple, or Zero to time your meals."
keto,"I don‚Äôt like it fresh out of the bag. But grilled cheese, French toast, and toasted sandwiches are amazing! Keep it in the fridge and it will last ü•∞"
keto,"The link between dietary cholesterol  and serum (blood) cholesterol levels has been debunked for years now.  Even the Heart Association has removed its recommendation to limit dietary cholesterol.  Eggs are safe/healthy.

I love sardines and keep cans around for quick and easy meals."
keto,May the Keto guide you
keto,I used to eat sardines several times a week for a snack or quick lunch. Only issue I saw with eating sardines is that people sitting around me at work would give me a tude due to the smell. ;)
keto,"You might be someone  who does better scheduling meals for specific times, at least until you learn your body's hunger signals.  Plan your meals - some sort of protein with its fat and a non-starchy vegetable - so you don't  have to decide, just prepare it."
keto,"Any quick significant weight loss will be likely to cause temporary hair loss, it usually grows back in a few months.

keto,"1st week of keto, down 10 lbs, first diet in a decade, feeling motivated!"
keto,"Not a big fan of sardines, but my pops loves em. They are insanely good for you. The only thing I would watch out for is the higher sodium content."
keto,"You don't need fiber and dietary cholesterol doesn't raise blood cholesterol.   
Plus, cholesterol isn't even bad.

keto,Not getting enough protein/micronutrients/calories is what will cause hair loss if you eat nothing but eggs. Please do yourself a favor and don‚Äôt jump into a gimmick like this.
keto,"Where did you get such a silly notion that eggs lead to heart disease? That‚Äôs some seriously flawed 1960s misinformation, right there.

Sardines are awesome."
keto,The 'egg diet' is a gimmick.  It's not a good idea.
keto,"Well, fluctuations are normal and honestly without a daily full body DEXA scan, nobody here can tell you definitively if it‚Äôs water or not. 

I eat keto at maintenance, so the same calories every day, and my weight fluctuates anywhere from 129-138 at any given time. Just be diligent and patient and it‚Äôll happen for you!!"
keto,Love em
keto,"I dunno-I‚Äôm just trying to figure out if this is a number I can ‚Äúcount‚Äù on if that makes sense...I feel like every time I see a lower number on the scale, I get scared that tomorrow it‚Äôll be way higher bc it‚Äôs just water fluctuation...."
keto,"I‚Äôm a carb addict.  My experience with keto is that even if I allow myself to over eat, my appetite will decline if I stick to low carb foods.  I actually gained a bit the first 2 weeks of keto but then my hunger level dropped."
keto,Does it matter? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It was weight you carried and now it‚Äôs gone! :)
keto,Yaaay I‚Äôm proud of you! Keep it going!
keto,"what a great, helpful post.  I am giving you a week of Reddit Gold!"
keto,Have you been drinking a lot of water? I found I wasn't drinking enough til about two days ago and that's when I started to notice it coming off quicker. I'm running to the bathroom every 15-20min now haha
keto,"That's great to hear! I'm sure some of that is water weight too as you probably know, but keep it up! :) I started on the third and I'm down around 5, which I'm guessing 95% of that is water weight and my xmas carb bloat finally leaving my body haha"
keto,"First of all good job on your weight loss and confidence. I wanted to ask, do you consume any supps? Especially electrolytes."
keto,"Ok, so it took you 56 weeks (14 months) to gain the weight, and you're disappointed that you've ""only"" lost 1 pound per week so far? Despite at your current pace, you'll go from your current weight (136 lbs) to your goal weight (110 lbs) in just 26 weeks - which would be less than half the time you put it on!? :)

If you look at it like that, which would be the realistic way to look at it, I think you can both relax and cheer up."
keto,Whatever you read is wrong. Erythritol can be fully subtracted always. It is one of the best sugar alcohols.  Mixing it with others doesn‚Äôt change anything.
keto,Thank you. I will avail myself of the resources you have cited. This forum is so helpful!
keto,"Yep, you are young and you won't even notice any damage you're doing for another 10-20 years."
keto," Hi guys, so recently I've started the keto diet (about a week ago), I'm just wondering if its possible to still lose weight even with cheat days where I'll be overeating in carbs + calories. In the past I lost 50kg+ just watching calories but I managed to gain alot of it back during lockdown, so I understand diets in general, but wondering if going in and out of ketosis will be worse for losing weight, thanks guys!"
keto,"Kratom cut the edge off wanting booze and suppressed my appetite. Also, weed believe it or not does not cause long term appetite increases. While munchies sure are a thing, most stoners you see are on the too skinny side of things."
keto,Honestly your long term success requires you to get better at cooking.  Food is Life.
keto,"If your sodium trends low due to the diuretic, your insulin will increase, stalling you out.  

Keto + diuretic = hyponatremia risk.

I'd be salting everything or better yet - drink ketoade."
keto,"I‚Äôm not sure how well I could answer this question, but I‚Äôll give it a go, and then point you towards some resources. Protein is a goal that should be hit daily to maintain lean mass in the body, which is metabolically active. Protein also is not easily stored as fat, so although calories do matter, over feeding on protein tends to drive up lean mass and energy expenditure. It also tends to be very satiating and nutrient dense. A couple of things to look into if you are still interested would be the protein leverage hypothesis and the P:E diet by Ted Naimen."
keto,"Welcome to r/keto! It sounds like you're asking a question about hair loss on keto.

Some people may experience hair loss during or after weight loss. This is a condition called telogen effluvium and it is not a keto-specific concern. It is usually temporary, lasting around 6 months. There are a few possible triggers for telogen effluvium besides weight loss including certain dietary deficiencies. More information can be found [here](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321590#treatment). As always if you are concerned, please consult a doctor or dermatologist.

keto,That‚Äôs very helpful! I‚Äôve heard this from a few people and I think it‚Äôs the best option right now! Thank you!
keto,"yeah i bike.. 

you'll need to get a sturdy bike but they do make them like this https://www.worksmancycles.com/worksman-big-bones-cruiser-big-man-on-campus--details.html

i ended up going from 295 to 250 now.. the last 20 lbs or so is from   biking as my main cardio."
keto,"And i enjoyed each gram of it, lol"
keto,I‚Äôm 37... I think I just realized why my knees are killing me üòí
keto,Thank youuuuuu. I'm from Sweden too and had no idea we had all these options lol
keto,"I guarantee you didn't gain it this quickly, good job man, you are killing it!"
keto,"This sub for the most part is pro-protein. It would cause a stall if you increase your calories through more protein without reducing calories elsewhere. I aim for 90-95g daily, personally, and that includes one 30g shake every morning. If you plan your protein first, fill in your calories with fat and carbs."
keto,Congrats!! Love the hair color too! :)
keto,I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an accurate way of saying it but this is not my area of expertise. I suggest you Repost at r/ketoscience.
keto,"Thanks for this info, I'll definitely check it out"
keto,Danke.
keto,"Day 3 of keto begins today. 2.6 lbs off.

Weighing myself daily because there‚Äôs more accountability there and I like data and want to see how my weight fluctuates."
keto,"Not sure. I think I gained back 13lbs in the past year, most of it in the last 7 months (relocated to another country so stress and bad eating etc). 

My lowest was 105lbs and my highest was 147lbs. To gain it took about 14 months. It was a few years ago though... Curious to know why are you asking?"
keto,"In case you didn't know, you'd get much better answers over in r/ketoscience."
keto,"So it would be only the cells without mitochondria, correct? All cells with mitochondria are versatile?"
keto,How long did it take you to GAIN all your weight?
keto,"After a couple weeks in ketosis, ketones are actually pretty much completely supplied to fuel the brain. Most of the rest of the body is running on free fatty acids, but the brain cannot. You also have some cells that lack mitochondria that need glucose such as cells in the kidney, eye, some cells in the brain, and red blood cells."
keto,"Actually losing 2lbs in 2 weeks is pretty good without really workoing out. Plus weight loss isn't linear, a week you could lose 1lb and another week 5lbs. Just keep going and dont worry about it, you will lose it anyway"
keto,"Take collagen 4 the lose skin u get, I was 330 now 225, but the lose skin is lots 4 me"
keto,"I‚Äôve tried every Highkey flavor and I absolutely loved all of them. Frosted was my favorite though. I‚Äôve never tried Magic Spoon though, but Highkey is solid."
keto,"I'm not the OP, but am curious why too much fat/not enough protein would slow progress. I am also stalled just 4 weeks in, and find that I am usually under my calorie allotment and have a deficit of protein as a percentage of my total. I had been following a pescatarian diet, but am finding it difficult to consume enough fish to reconcile this deficit. I have no trouble achieving the fat threshold, but were I to restrict fat in order to reconcile the percentages, I'd probably drop below 700 calories a day, which seems too extreme, even for my sedentary lifestyle."
keto,30%
keto,A similar thing happened to me this week when ordering online groceries. I got all excited about cauliflower fries advertised as keto friendly then looked at the carb count 24g per 100g was carbs and 14g was sugar ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
keto,"I started losing weight in September of 2018. I was extremely heavy then, and as I‚Äôm approaching a normal weight things have slowed down significantly. It‚Äôs got a lot to do with our height and the fact that we‚Äôre women, so it‚Äôs like two struggles at once."
keto,"oh, it's so nice to find someone with the same stats. defiantly doesn't happen a lot. someone finally understand the slowness, thank god ;)  may I ask when did you start this journey?"
keto,"Regular cow milk? Yeah, that is full of lactose so it should taste sweet. That‚Äôs a load of carbs!"
keto,"Yeah there are so many things I took for granted at home but don‚Äôt have here. I only know one other person here (my Kiro) that has even heard of it. 

Have you checked out tights.no? They have a keto section now - and many low carb options for tortillas, breads, etc."
keto,"I was very tempted to go under 1200 calories yesterday, while tracking macros (I've recovered from an eating disorder).

I took that thought, stored it away in the box of ""unhealthy thoughts that we put aside"", and ate until I was satiated within my macro. I think it's a small victory."
keto,"Those are all high fat, protein is more important."
keto,"&gt;ProtiDiet foods

Sounds like an mlm scheme"
keto,Interesting. Thank you for letting me know
keto,"I think most shellfish have  carbs.   
Liver does too."
keto,Very helpful Thanks!
keto,"There are a few good low carb ice cream options available now, have to make sure you grab the ‚Äòketo‚Äô line with Enlightened (they say keto around the lid), Halo Top makes a keto line as well, and Rebel Creamery are all keto"
keto,"I personally can deal without any added sugar. But I have been on keto for a while. The craving for anything sweet goes away. 

A friend pushed me to try a piece of baklava and it was a violent insult on my taste buds. After a while the taste of sugar just becomes overwhelming. 

If you‚Äôre making the stir fry, you are in charge. If the recipe says sugar, you can substitute (monk fruit sweetener, stevia, xylotho), change (tomato paste, sweet pepper paste) or ignore. Thats the beauty of being in charge of your meals. Try, experiment and do whats best for you. 

I would highly recommend cutting out sugars as fast as you can."
keto,Reckon this breaches the ‚Äúbe respectful‚Äù rule üôÉ
keto,My government does that for me
keto,Hahaha
keto,Literally no relevance
keto,Sooo that means I can‚Äôt ask opinions on keto? Ummm ok
keto,"Sugar subs are used in a lot of low-carb/keto recipes. I think in moderation, those are fine. Regular old cane sugar/corn syrup are a no go usually."
keto,"So basically, in theory you can have sugar, but it isn‚Äôt really worth it with how many carbs it will cost"
keto,"Yes I get that, I meant to say not worth having sugar if it costs you that many carbs for so little."
keto,Count me in. I started a couple months back but fell off Christmas and New Year's. Back on the diet now and would love a weight loss buddy!
keto,"3 years keto here.  I switch between deficit and maintenance calories often but I tend to keep the keto level carbs because I just feel better on it. No more acid reflux is a bigger blessing than I can convey. I do have a cheat meal (note: meal not day) every 3 months or so (sometimes I skip it, depends how I feel) but that's often just a piece of fruit or a potato because I don't want to risk acid reflux coming back.  As for energy levels mine vary - they can be bad if my sodium is low (I need a lot) but mostly they are OK."
keto,I started Keto on Monday. Idk about you but i'm more tired during the day now. I'm usually fine with 8 hours of sleep but even thats not doing it for me
keto,You can absolutely stay on keto and drink but the important thing to remember is that the idea behind keto is to get your body to use fat stores for energy. Alcohol can‚Äôt be stored as energy for later so your body will use any alcohol up before going back to using fat. Most importantly though as with all things relating to any diet keto works because of calories in and calories out so moderation is key.
keto,"That works for many, and I wish I was one, but I've had too many failures triggered by ""just this once"" thinking. This time I made a commitment to NEVER go off plan. Two years later, it's worked for me. üôÇ"
keto,"I was 100% worn down by keto around the 11th month. My diet was so monotonous even though my wife has been a rockstar in the kitchen.  I never strayed too far, but I needed a break &amp; started eating more and more nuts, too much dark chocolate, and eating crusts on pizza Fridays, and my year culminated with eating oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.    


And you know what?  I felt like dogshit, I was bloated and had gas (which I never have on keto), my sleep was terrible, energy was 0 - took my first nap in 11 months.  The weird thing was how slowly all of that crept up - like boiling a frog in water.  Now that I have cut back on the carbs, I feel incredible again. Totally rejuvenated &amp; I‚Äôm back on strict keto and forgot how good it feels."
keto,"Picked up some Bob's Xanthan Gum today to make protein fluff, but I noticed it doesn't have fiber in it (anymore). Is this an error on the nutrition or did they change it so that it doesn't have fiber at all? Would be awful if the latter, but if anyone knows anything..."
keto,"Avocados, avocados, avocados, whipping cream (in moderation), olive oil, and nuts.  It‚Äôs tough, but doable."
keto,"Right? I'm on my third wardrobe! I've gotten used to wearing the same things over and over. But I also have more fun shopping, so now I have more than I probably should, since I plan to lose more. I still feel weird but amazed that I no longer shop the ""plus"" section."
keto,"Google ""autophagy loose skin."" I'm not 100% certain it works, but it's worth a shot."
keto,"https://www.sweetashoney.co/coconut-flour-chocolate-cake-keto-paleo/

My FAVORITE cake. 
Taste so good and so sweet."
keto,"Have had experience with Fresh &amp; Lean, here are my thoughts. The food is very tasty, lots of variety, easy to heat up, and have well balanced macros. The meals are fresh, not frozen. The delivery is regularly reliable. The prices are a bit steep. The packaging comes with a lot of waste."
keto,"I think the longer you take off the longer it takes to get back into it. No scientific sources but it seems to be my experience. When im in it and I take a weekend off I can bounce right back pretty quick, when I took a year off, it took me almost a month to really get back into it again."
keto,"R/ketodrunk probably covers this but if you drink too much it will knock you out of ketosis temporarily, and even lightly drinking, if done too often, can cause stalls. Your body has to process the alcohol before it goes back to making ketones so just something to keep in mind."
keto,"Oh it is best avoided, but you can use your carb macro  for whatever you want.  The source doesn't matter for ketosis."
keto,Oh thank you! Cos i thought sugar is best avoided since we can get other substitues.
keto,"Keto isn't a no sugar diet.  You  and their friend are wrong. Your carbs can be from any source. It might not be a good choice, but as far as ketosis is concerned you could eat 20 g carbs from Skittles if you wanted."
keto,"This is so awesome, and makes me very excited to start my own keto journey. This is definitely a NSV! As someone who suffers from PTSD related nightmares, but also really enjoys happy dreams, and even semi holds them to a spiritual level, this gives me a lot of hope! I'm trying to treat my issues in more natural ways instead of tons and tons of meds. This is super awesome, and gives me a lot of hope and inspiration. I truly enjoy happy dreams, also buzz light-year is awesome! :)
Thank you so much for sharing this cool experience with the community!!!!"

keto,Hiii am in üëâüëà
keto,I've heard a bit about oxalates and spinach recently. Might be something to look at.
keto,"Awesome!! I still get my migraines, but so excited for you."
keto,"1 teaspoon is 4.2g of carbs per what google says. 

You well get used to it and be more aware over time of carbs. You can have sugar. As long as it fits into your macros. But you can avoid that if you use keto friendly sweeteners. The taste is not the same but trust me, its just as good. 

I also find youtubing a recipe for whatever you‚Äôre craving + keto added at the beginning has been a blessing."
keto,"4-5 grams per teaspoon.  

Most aim to be under 20-25 per day for keto.

Don't forget that you also have to consider the carbs in veggies too.

It's not that hard to skip the sugar.  Just don't add it."
keto,One gram of sugar = one gram of carbs (total and net)
keto,Ok that makes it more clear thanks. It seems like I‚Äôm a total idiot but I want to be so clear on things so I don‚Äôt mess up my ketosis‚Äô

keto,Your friend is speaking from a position of ignorance.  You can have sugar but keep in mind that Sugar = Carbs so you need to account for it in your macros.
keto,Yes u cant use sugar!! Try sweetners like stevia or erythritol?
keto,"My family and l very recently started keto like a week ago. Ive struggled more than them, so far. I want to see if you guys recomend me anything to make it easier for us on this transition! 
Right now, theres no carbs, no sugar, no splenda in tea/coffee, no nothing. Veggies, meats, and dairy only. We replaced our old trusty splenda for Lakanto sweet monk fruit sweeter (which is eh). I have a few berries everyday, since apparently thats the only ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù fruit? I dont eat bacon, and the smell of eggs makes me wanna throw up in the morning, what do you guys have for breakfast as options? 

Is any 0 sugar candy ok with keto? I found some gummies with no sugar added, is that okay? 
 Im still very new, so sorry if my questions are stupid. Im very nervous postinf this, so any recomendations, tips and anyting would help! 
Thank you Keto guys and girls!"
keto,Fellow mandalorian fan?
keto,"This is so inspiring!!

7.4lbs down started on Jan 01!"
keto,I prefer smaller meals during the day. 100% enjoy snack size!
keto,"Looks like the BOT needs to read the posting again.

Got it wrong on this one."
keto,Like what?
keto,thank you for a daily dose of inspiration...
keto,"Nearly 2 years and 137 pounds down, been intermittent fasting as well which started 2 months after keto started. Cravings have never been an issue on this regimen, even when drunk! It‚Äôs strange being so close to switching to maintenance. Time flies!"
keto,Same one then
keto,"Vegetarian makes things much harder. I Guess you could chew on veggies.

Tbh i have a really hard time Imagine where to get fats and protein while on a vegetarian and keto diet."
keto,"Have you tried baking with a sugar alternative? When my sugar cravings are intense, I'll usually make some chocolate""cake"" by adding cocoa powder and either monk fruit or ethryol sweetener. (Don't use stevia, the aftertaste is no good). There is also this keto ice cream called Enlightened that has only one net carb!! Lots of alternative sweets if you Google it üòä"
keto,"In general, keto is pretty black and white. 99% of people will be in ketosis if they stay under 20 net carbs. That goes down with the more carbs you have above 20. Early on when I started keto, I had a fancy scallop dinner than found out scallops apparently have actually a lot of carbs and I went over. The thing is, you just try the next day. The only other part I'd say is it does take a couple weeks to get into ketosis if you've been carb heavy previously."
keto,Your brain uses ketones for fuel more efficiently and with less waste product than when it uses glucose. Might be the connection. Keto has been a diet recommended for other neurological problems like seizures and now Alzheimer‚Äôs
keto,"I will say I am on my second go around and it took longer to get going. I stuck with it but it might have even been a couple of weeks before i was really in ketosis and in that keto groove. I knew I could do it and now Im losing again (minus the few pounds i put on getting off track over Christmas ) whatever you fo, don‚Äôt give up and keep going. You didn‚Äôt put it on in a Couple of weeks, its not all coming off in a couple of weeks. Good luck, you can do it!"
keto,Two good vanilla greek yogurt with a huge helping of whip cream. I eat this everyday. Pickles are my 2nd.
keto,"

I used to get headaches bad enough to make me vomit on the second day of my menstrual cycle pretty much every month. Once I started keto I stopped getting the period headache. I've been out of ketosis during my period three times during the two years I've been doing keto and I've gotten a headache each time."
keto,"I‚Äôm so excited to go back to the US this year and have this at some point!
Def not cost friendly for all the time, but it sounds like a lovely treat and it‚Äôs so nice to have options. Like on a shopping day at the mall"
keto,Oh avocados are also amazing.
keto,"Are you vegitarian or pescitarian?

Personally eggs and cheese work wonders but if you can't eat those then I would suggest veggies, fruit smoothies, yogurt (freeze it for a quicker grab and go)

Keto sounds very hard to do if your also vegitarian. Not saying it's impossible but it might help to start out slow and gradually transition to a more low carb diet till your more use to eating workout carbs."
keto,"They‚Äôve had these for a while, but cauliflower rice is a new option."
keto,"I have no time to cook, I like ProtiDiet foods on Amazon. I actually leave a box in my car for long work commutes."
keto,That's about 2.3 lb/week. Nice! I hit 2.5lb this week and am worried it's too much üò¨ any thoughts on when to try to oull back on the rate of loss?
keto,I'm in about 3 Weeks and it's getting real intense !! Sugar Cravins are real !!
keto,"Wouldn't recommend lily's as it may spike your insulin trigger. The ingredients aren't keto friendly really either but definitely the best of a bad bunch of alternatives.

What I do for my cravings and I have awful periods 7-10 days long and I'm normally bed ridden so I know all about pleasing the ovary gods üò≠üò≠üò≠

-keto Avocado brownies 
-Sugar free jelly and natural yogurt or cream 
-Keto almond biscuits with dark choc chips, or coconut flakes or pecan flakes. Add in whatever really. 
-Keto hot chocolate



Diet doctor.com is worth a gander."
keto,Congratulations! Thank you for sharing your inspirational story!
keto,"Ahh... I just ran through the (surprisingly in depth) FAQ, got to electrolytes section and I eat a lot  of spinach (mostly every meal)/avacado (1 a day usually)/seaweed(once/twice a day as a wrap)/fish (every other day.)

There might just be something else wrong with me or my body just isn't reacting as positively to the diet any longer. I do constantly battle keto rash, it might be trying to tell me something. I'm not sure. Thank you for taking the time to reply though! 

I came to keto after being completely vegan for 8 years (last 2 without sugar I lost 90lbs) and the keto wasn't really a *needed diet* as I was already eating pretty clean, just decided to try it after I started eating meat again because all of my protein consumption (being vegan) was not only mostly incomplete protein, but HEAVY carbs (lentils/grains/beans) and I felt **so** damn amazing in ketosis I just thought it was optimal &amp; kept going back trying to get that immortal feeling back lol I can incorporate complete proteins now though so I may be better with lower carbs, not necessarily in ketosis.

I'll take a break, see how I feel. Hopefully the carbs will motivate me to hit the gym, I just feel completely unmotivated &amp; ultimately it could be mental issues or whatever. Guess we'll find out. If I'm not back on track in a couple weeks I'll be seeing a Dr. to get some tests done because there may be a bigger issue at play."
keto,"Are you building muscles during keto or just focused on weight loss? I'm wondering if your caloric deficit is too low for the amount of exercise you get.

Also, not sure if this is an issue in your area, but never underestimate seasonal affective disorder with decreased daylight hours. May even be an issue just with covid and spending more time indoors and in front of screens. Here in NY, those susceptible have felt the impact for the past 3-4 months or so."
keto,I second this!! The Aldi bread is so good and the texture is right on par with normal bread!
keto,"Some gas stations and grocery stores now sell individual packs of salami/cheese roll ups. They are awesome, and microwaved become a nice pizza substitute."
keto,I bet you'll like cornichons too. I like them with sliced parm.
keto,ü§£
keto,Pretty sure if I followed that advice I would need to call these people:   https://www.instagram.com/p/CJuhwsHgzf-/?igshid=cpq8tptzj5xy
keto,"What if it were just raw egg yolks, etc as I mentioned above? Further, would keto/OMAD/surplus stunt growth or something? That is, a typical weight person eating 4-5 dozen yolks in a 23:1 window.

Fats need choline for processing. I suspect many don't get enough vitamin B4, selenium, and alkalizing minerals while keto."
keto,"Quest protein cookies , quest low carb pizza , keto ice cream. Are my cheat meals on keto ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
keto,"&gt;Cocaine.

Mix it with MCT oil sweetened with maltitol.   
It'll really get you moving!"
keto,"You should see this over on r/ketodrunk but just as a heads up, your tolerance is likely to go WAY down.  Like I went from 3 drinks to get a buzz to one.  But hey it's cheaper I guess."
keto,"After I had an implant put in, I was eating a lot of [egg loaf](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/90r29m/egg_loaf_troubleshooting/e2stnyh/) (tastes like French toast), [microwaved omelets](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/6p4i28/jimmy_dean_simple_scrambles/dko9pfh/), and [microwaved cream cheese pancakes (""custard in a bowl"")](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/6tps7g/request_favorite_keto_desserts/dlmm38m).

If you grind up the meat finely enough, you could do chicken salad, ham/SPAM salad, or tuna salad, or even [a bowl of chili](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7dq1y3/ketoground_beef_chicken_dinner_ideas/dq0mg71). I just use my Magic Bullet.

If you want something sweet, [Quickie no-bake ""cheesecake""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/6tps7g/request_favorite_keto_desserts/dlmllk3), or there's always Halo Top, Enlightened, or Breyer's Carb Smart ice creams.

keto,Macadamia nuts. Cheese.
keto,"White Rum on the rocks, but only for tooth aches/pain."
keto,I‚Äôd bet my next paycheck this is your problem. It‚Äôll fix you right up. üëçüèª
keto,"I've never paid attention to electrolytes, I'll have to look into it. Good place to start, thank you!"
keto,This is a great idea
keto,Do you supplement electrolytes per the FAQ? I‚Äôm 3 years in and still supplement daily. I feel great all the time.
keto,"Review your food log and tell us how many grams of electrolytes you are getting each day, AND, how big of a deficit you are eating at.    
           
Finally, eat at maintenance for a week or so and see if that helps."
keto,"Good to hear. I‚Äôd rather eat good salad and chicken or shrimp, neither which have much fat.I think I was worrying too that I‚Äôd need the fat grams to keep energy up. I guess I‚Äôll just play around with it. Today added mct oil to coffee, other easy ways like whipping cream to coffee too.. The thought of greasy hamburger &amp; loads of bacon not appealing at all!"
keto,Tom's videos are excellent because they're easy to digest and he has a relatable and inspiring transformation from obese guy to super fit keto guy
keto,Congratulations!!! Making good progress! :)
keto,Not all that often really. Just a few different grips on a pull-up bar each day and some isolated resistance band workouts a couple times a week.
keto,"I really wish it wasn't, I buy the food out of my own pocket and cook it myself too, so why should others care what I eat. It's just sad to see that my mother would probably rather see me stuff myself with chips and fries rather than be on keto."
keto,Lol that's a good one. Hahaha
keto,"I agree 100%. Its just easier for overworked employees to give extra rice in the first place instead of waiting for the customer to ask for more/and or complain because they already expect a serving size bigger than 4oz. It sucks to disappoint people with small portions, but it's also hard to see your grill person struggling to keep up with everything they have to do :/"
keto,"I know exactly what you mean. In my circle, there are 2 things my friends and family do not understand. Keto and Bitcoin. 

They are feeding you too much negative energy. They have to understand (even though they won't haha)  it's not for everyone and you would only gain the weight back if you started eating carbs again. At this point you can only agree to disagree. If they don't get it you can link them Dr eric berg. A good keto advocate. 

Even some of my friends who are more intelligent, more academically educated and are dietitians as a profession tell me keto is unsustainable and that it's a fad/gimmick. They don't understand keto is very particular, niche and unique. There a few ways of doing it. There is also a healthy and sustainable variation but they write it all off because they think it's just eating bacon and broccoli. 

For me the doubt and skepticism fuels my ego to want to prove them wrong even more which gives gives me motivation not not give up and to push/go through with it even more. It's about me being right now. But whatever gets the job done right?

What I started doing is making up bullshit to get them to shut it on a bad/long day where I ceebs. ""I'm allergic or sensitive to carbs"". I actually am to an extent haha. There are pros to eating carbs not gonna deny but like I don't reckon its a worthy the trade off and most importantly it's my own personal bloody decision. When I'm on keto I go to the toilet once a day and I'm done. When I get off keto use carb to bulk. I have to be in the toilet at least 5 times a day with tummy aches also not to mention all the acne and pimples I get all over my body. On keto I'm all buttery smooth. I even get compliments from some of the girls I'm with. 

Oh and BMI is a bullshit measurements IMO."
keto,"The ratio that works for me is 64 oz of water, 1 tsp of no salt (the 100% potassium kind), 2 tsp of table salt, and Mio to taste. I also then take 300 mg of magnesium citrate in pill form daily. Ideally, I‚Äôd drink 2 of those batches per day, but I‚Äôm not 100% consistent with finishing the whole 128 oz. I also heavily salt pretty much everything I eat with lite salt, which is a blend of sodium and potassium. 

There is a lot of good information about electrolyte replacement in the subreddit‚Äôs FAQ. But remember that they are general guidelines and some people need more or less depending on things like their activity levels or dietary habits."
keto,"Just finished. Honestly, I‚Äôm just more confused. Maybe because I‚Äôm not in a good head space and so I‚Äôm not processing the info. Could you ELI5? I would really appreciate it."
keto,the qdoba protein bowl is epic
keto,Thanks for providing that explanation. They set themselves up for disappointed customers if they have portion requirements they enforce selectively. I think they need to reexamine something in the process to make the experience and taste closer to what people expect.
keto,Thanks! That seems to be what I‚Äôm hearing most. Went searching for a recipe and found about 100. I‚Äôm assuming most of them are similar at least. Do you have a favorite recipe?
keto,Good job man! How often do you work out?
keto,This is sooo typical of loved ones and friends when one is losing weight. Be strong and tell them to back off. You don‚Äôt want to hear it anymore.
keto,"‚ÄúThanks for your opinion but I‚Äôm not interested in discussing how I‚Äôm choosing to eat. Please respect that from now on.‚Äù

If they don‚Äôt stop: ‚ÄúWhy are you so obsessed with how I eat? Mind your own business.‚Äù

This is also crabs in a bucket and is a pretty normal experience."
keto,I grabbed it today and it was just okay for me.  It's nice to have the alternative but I'm probably going to just go back to the keto salad next time.
keto,"Push through the suck and know it's just your body trying to trick you back into bad habits. It won't last long at all so if you can get past it you'll see that your body adjusts and it's nothing to worry about.

If your experience ends up anything like mine, the period right after was like having an epiphany. Suddenly I actually didn't get hungry. At least not the sort of hunger I'm used to. I actually had to sort of remember to eat once I felt like it because my brain/stomach for the first time didn't scream for food every few of hours. Now I feel like I'm a bit closer to normal, but it was a huge shock at how much keto changes your hunger. Anytime I've tried to lose weight other ways in the past it was about sheer willpower or distraction and never really addressed the underlying hunger."
keto,Read the automod links first and foremost.
keto,Oh I can guarantee it won't.
keto,No one's mentioning that it's cooked with rice bran oil.  I can't imagine that's any better then vegetable oil. Way worse than carbs.
keto,"In the beginning people told me I was just loosing water weight, that it wasn‚Äôt real, I would gain it all back once I ate ‚Äúreal‚Äù food again. My response was, well if I was carrying around 50lbs of water weight then I needed to loose it! Having that much extra ‚Äúwater‚Äù in your body can‚Äôt be good! Then I laugh and it throws them off. Then I explain that it works for me and I‚Äôm not going back to eating the kinds of foods that ‚Äúforced‚Äù my body to carry around that kind of extra ‚Äúwater‚Äù weight. That my joints have never been happier. And then I move the conversation on to the next topic."
keto,"Thank you so much for this post! Long time lurker here, just started my account today actually, and am happy to be among my people! I chose the indulgent path detour over the holidays, enjoyed it, did not regret, and already back on Keto Highway! It helps knowing that I‚Äôm not alone. We‚Äôre all in this together, and we‚Äôre going to kick some ass!! Let‚Äôs go team!! :)"
keto,So you'll be paying $17 lol. Double everything would have made it worth $14.
keto,Carl Jrs/Hardees and I'd argue they do it better
keto,"25 lbs of rice can be bought for $23.62 at Costco and makes 227 servings of 180 calories each.

Cheapest vegetable option at Costco is their frozen Normandy vegetable mix (so its filled with non keto friendly carrots, but to be fair I'm using the cheapest veggie option) is $8.45 for 5.5 lbs.  Makes 25 servings at 30 calories each.

Mathematically the bag of rice has 40,860 calories at $23.62 or 1,729.89 calories per dollar spent.  Cost per serving is about 8.5 cents.

The frozen Normandy vegetables has 750 calories at $8.45 or 88.76 calories per dollar spent.  Cost per serving (with of course much less calories) is 33.8 cents.

Surely you can see how carbohydrate based diets are significantly cheaper than keto."
keto,"I think I typically do double meat, minus rice, beans, etc and it‚Äôs grubbin just under $14 (i think). 

I‚Äôll try the keto bowl tomorrow, but double meat is my middle name."
keto,Realgood ice cream is the closest to regular ice cream. You're welcome.

keto,"It's not even that my stomach feels empty. It's like:

Stomach: I do not require food.

Energy levels: You're okay here.

Brain: EAT. EAT. EAT EVERYTHING YOU SEE AND DON'T STOP, EVER!! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PUT SOME FOOD IN YOUR MOUTH RIGHT NOW!!

It might be electrolytes, like other commenters have said, or it could be getting used to new eating patterns is requiring a mental reset, but it's weird."
keto,What is ‚Äúlong term‚Äù in this context?

keto,"They will make ANY burger or chicken sandwich lettuce wrapped... actually,most places will. I think that some places started it because of the gluten intolerance people..Whenever I'm craving a certain place I just go on Google and type-What's Keto at (restaurant)..Some guy has a whole blog( can't think of his name right now) but,he goes to every fast food place and tastes the low carb offerings...I actually like getting a big Mac from McDonald's in a bowl with extra cheese,sauce,and lettuce."
keto,"I have read the FAQ and might have missed that out! Thank you so much for your help, really appreciate it!"

keto,You look amazing! Congratulations Dan.
keto,Yes! I ordered with DoorDash yesterday and accidentally ordered a double helping of cauliflower rice...still couldn‚Äôt find it in my burrito bowl!! I‚Äôm sticking to the protein bowl minus the beans in the future.

keto,You may need to adjust a setting in the app to properly subtract sugar alcohols
keto,"Halo Top is disgusting. Rebel ice cream is my favorite ice cream, keto or not."
keto,"Smash Burger definitely does, another reply pointed me there and it's on their online order app for an option"
keto,"He is great! He just added a nutritionist to his practice, one with a keto focus, who is going to be running remote support groups, so helpful. It is also great that he takes insurance and consults remotely. His practice and videos help so many! I thought the vids would be about beating yourself up but they really are about loving yourself and it being ok to be imperfect. I go for walks a lot now, I do not have a dog like he is always talking about, but I borrow one from the neighbors. Great stuff!"
keto,Ooooh our local chipotles trialed it and then it was gone last summer ... it tastes amazing! Like there is zero chance I will ever be able to to whatever they are doing to cauliflower to taste that good. Totally worth it as a Keto burrito bowl makes 2 good sized meals.
keto,"Chipotle employee here. The problem is normal rice is super over portioned (it's supposed to be 4oz), and the cauliflower rice is not only a pain to make, but also expensive. I'm not saying your meal had the 4oz portion it's supposed to, but a lot of people expect way more rice than they're actually supposed to get lol"
keto,"Might want to try carnivore for a month and slowly reintroduce keto stuff until you figure it out. Beef, salt, and water if you wanna go hardcore."
keto,"Paprika and garlic salmon topped with avocado and cauliflower rice, bacon/spinach/cheese egg bites, cheesecake fat bombs, and coffee with sugar free creamer :)"
keto,"True. Rice do be cheap. 

Do they at least cook it with lime and cilantro like they do the normal rice?

Idk, the Chipotle by my house is only doing orders through their app due to covid. I'm really stubborn about when companies force you to use their bloatware so I haven't eaten there for almost a year now.

And for $12, I still don't really have any incentive. That's enough for wings, which (to me) tastes better and has little to no carbs vs the 9g+ net I was already getting before the added 4g net with cauli rice. Not worth the omad imo.

Idk, it's cool that they're appealing to ketoers but it's not for me."

keto,"Huh, I‚Äôm getting ripped off! $3 for the 10pz bags at my local grocery store."
keto,"The homemade route is way cheaper and more effective than the vast majority of commercial products. I would continue supplementing the entire time you are on a Keto diet because the Keto flu can occur any time you have an electrolyte deficiency. I‚Äôve heard of people that were able to reduce the amount they supplemented over time, but I always felt better at the original recipe anyways."
keto,"4 net carbs for the rice. Gotta hope they are on point with serving sizes. This is awesome though, it's nice to see other restaurants get some option out there for the keto peeps."
keto,FWIW I think Killer Creamery and Rebel Ice Cream are WAY better.  Might be worth trying next time you have a weakness for some ice cream.
keto,Not sure if Smash does lettuce. Call and ask.
keto,"For someone you're weight and size 30g of carbs is like, laughably small, I remember my first week of keto I would calculate my Saturday morning meal at around 200g. 

But yea you pretty much have to be in those numbers"
keto,"What is the downside of trying it for 3 months? 

There's nothing that says you have to eat the same diet as he does, but given what you said it seems to me that the higher caloric density in keto foods - and especially the higher fat density - could be a benefit for you."
keto,"I started Keto today and I can‚Äôt tell you how thankful I am for this post, and all the super helpful replies!

keto,"Guacamole Thickburger all day long!

Fun fact... it used to be called the $6 burger when it was $4. The idea was that you were getting more for your money like a restaurant-quality burger. But, when they raised the price to $6 (inflation) the value proposition of the name went away so they changed it to a Thickburger."

keto,Habit is great!
keto,"When I was full keto it was:

keto,Wendy's is great. Underrated burgers for sure.
keto,It‚Äôs ridiculous how excited I am for this!!!
keto,Carl's Jr./Hardee's has offered lettuce wrap burgers for years. They're great and they have drive through everywhere.
keto,"Unfortunately, keto levels don't really tell us very much. 

What we would really like to know is keto creation/usage rates, but - to pick some arbitrary units - we could be creating and using 10 units per minute or 1 unit per minute and that could result in the same blood level. 

This is pretty common in our physiology.

Here's a graph of blood glucose during exercise (presumably for a non-keto person): [https://ct-stem.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/Nell/2017/08/07/BG%20during%20exercise.png](https://ct-stem.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/Nell/2017/08/07/BG%20during%20exercise.png)

This person will be using a lot more glucose during exercise, but there isn't a strong effect on blood glucose levels."
keto,"I use no sugar zero carb ketchup that I get at my grocery store. then you just season it. It's not hard. Mix it with italian herbs, some worcestershire an egg or two and whatever. Not that complicated."
keto,"Wendy's also makes their caesar salad with parmesan chips instead of croutons, so another low carb option."
keto,No problem! Hopefully that works for you.
keto,Walmart has the small bags for $1 and they are 5x what a spoon at Chipotle is.
keto,Meh - it‚Äôs really not all that great - the up charge is ridiculous!  It‚Äôs friggin cauliflower!
keto,It'll be frozen. At that volume nationwide there would be too much spoilage. Chipotle is not In-N-Out.
keto,Packaged but not frozen
keto,"My response has nothing to do with being anti-lazy keto. It's a direct response to the fact that this person is asking for help after gaining weight on keto and feeling defeated.

If lazy keto works for someone then that's awesome and they should keep going. It doesn't work for everyone, especially people who are less stable emotionally, and it doesn't always work forever. It's not even clear that OP is doing lazy keto, they haven't responded.

You're more than welcome to write your own advice to OP though instead of just jumping in to refute mine and assuming I'm anti-lazy keto."
keto,ty for the recommendation!!

And even if you're out and need something to eat you can still find keto friendly meals at quick places. I just found out this week that Subway does 'protein bowls' now and it's basically any of the sandwiches in a bowl! The meatball one though they give you 8 meatballs.

Also you can order any of the sandwiches or burritos at Sonic without the bun or tortilla!"

keto,"I just bought the big bag of unwashed spinach Aldi sold, and I simmer it in water for a few minutes. I forgot to wash it the first time. Gritty food isn't nice lol. I still have a bag left, so i'll try it raw and try and spice it up. Maybe mash the avocado with it and some lemon juice. Combing two boring foods could help. But I probably wont buy any more, lifes to short to eat things you don't like and it makes the diet harder. 

I'm not a huge fan of cheese sadly. I have a block of it as I like cheese toasties, but without the toast its just... cheese. I'll nibble on it when i get hungry I guess. Though my favourite salty snack are pistachios. I checked the macros and they're not overly carb heavy so i'll grab a few bags and limit myself with them."
keto,"I just realized I‚Äôve been eating this way for 233 days. That‚Äôs a long time! Of course there have been small breaks because I‚Äôm not perfect. The holidays have given me about 5lb on, but I‚Äôve already lost three from hopping back onto my *real* way of eating. The new year is time to be rejuvinated and I am just that. I am excited to reach 365 days here soon. Then the next milestone can be forever!"
keto,"I know this is the catch-all in this subreddit but it's honestly one that turns me off.   Lazy Keto works, I mean I get making sure that you're not eating 7000k calories a day but as long as you're under 20G Carbs a day you should be in ketosis.   The WHOLE point of being low carb (keto) is that you can easily get into ketosis by not eating more than 20G\~ carbs a day.  The WHOLE point of this is that your body burns off fat instead of ketones for energy.   Unless something has changed.   Anyways, no disrespect just wanted to get that off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

Shout out to all my lazy keto peeps!"
keto,"Yep, I caught that.  Canned green beans are the worst kind of overcooked, oversalted YUCK.  I would try this with frozen french cut though, and that's a great idea, since they are something that CAN hang out in the freezer for an extended amount of time.  It's not the worst idea."
keto,"Thanks for the word of caution but I think what makes this case a bit different is that I'm referring to refraining from eating non-keto friendly foods rather than food in general which is why I mentioned the part about ""my healthy keto journey"". I'm happily hitting my 2k daily calories but just making sure it's with items that fall within my macros."
keto,"There's this weird phenomenon -- when you're doing it, it feels like it's taking forever. But if you only lose 5 pounds a month, eight months later it's suddenly 40 pounds and people think it happened overnight. You got this!"
keto,That‚Äôs the spirit!!!
keto,"I will have to try this, thank you :)¬•"
keto,Oh my gosh! The changes in such a short amount of time are phenomenal. Amazing work - especially given the holidays!! Keep these progress photos coming please!
keto,You‚Äôve lost it
keto,Same here. It was my mantra. I lived by it. Everything in my life was controlled be every single molecule of food.  I never want to go back to that. I had the unhealthiest relationship with food.
keto,"Did you try raw baby spinach ? I hate cooked spinach but discovered that baby spinach with some vinaigrette and mozzarella is amazing. 

Avocados can be tasty if you know how to choose them and eat them at optimal ripeness. You don't have to eat them if you don't like them, but I know some people enjoy avocados with some salt, chili flakes and even olive oil. You can also mash it with a little lemon juice and experiment with spices for a guacamole-like spread.

Try eating salty snacks when you crave sweet: pickles and cheese helped me overcome the sugar cravings of the first week."
keto,I'm really hoping OP is under 5' with those numbers.
keto,Salad?
keto,The link between dietary cholesterol and serum (blood) cholesterol levels has been disproven for years now.  Even the Heart Association has eliminated it's recommendation to limit dietary cholesterol.
keto,"Look for Dave Feldman's talks on cholesterol ""hyper responders."". It sounds like you are one."
keto,Yes!
keto,What do you eat in a typical day?
keto,In no world. Don‚Äôt post shitty broscience medical advice again.
keto,That‚Äôs Facebook where keto goes to be exceptionally stupid.
keto,"‚ÄúClean‚Äù is a meaningless term. 

You are very misinformed about calories and your statements are incorrect. Keto isn‚Äôt magic. 

Read the FAQ before posting again."
keto,Ooh I really like that one. Thanks for sharing!
keto,"The average large egg has about 0.4 net carbs. So if you're using extra large eggs, the nutritional label could be rounding up to 1."
keto,"Oh I misunderstood you then. I thought you were saying 40-50 total, half of which was whey. I would still think you would be better off getting more protein, 120g is good, but mostly from real food rather than powder. There are lots of other nutrients in meat that don‚Äôt come along for the ride as a processed supplement."
keto,"Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels! 

If that simple sentence doesn't hit hard! Shit I needed to hear that! 3 weeks in with minimal progress. Thank you for this post!"
keto,I apologize if this was triggering. The point I was trying to make is that I took a historically troublesome saying and sort of turned it on its head to use it for good and measured motivation for myself.
keto,"I take 40-50g only from whey daily. My total protein is around 90-100 daily. I'm 58kg (around 140lbs) so I don't think it's bad although I guess I could bump it up to 120g, although I don't really lift or excercise lately so I didn't think it's necessary to go that high when I sit most of the day"
keto,Looks loose to me! üôå
keto,"Idk, there are a lot of people in the keto world who are afraid of protein, either due to gluconeogenesis, or from fear of cancer through mtor. Also, people who are newcomers to keto tend to overdo the fat at the expense of protein."
keto,See a doctor
keto,"Ya you can make your own electrolyte drink, drink salty bone broth, and even low carb foods like pickles and olives have a decent amount of sodium. But typically you can‚Äôt just rely on salting your food to taste, at least not in the beginning."
keto,Ha! I wish that I were joking!
keto,"Do organic and cage free meats, eggs and milk. Try to eat more vegetables."
keto,Chickens and ducks are great for eggs and can be great for permaculture...
keto,Yes. If you're doing clean keto you will be able to eat a healthy amount of calories and still lose weight. Eating under can actually make your body hold on to weight.
keto,"Just wanted to say welcome aboard everyone! You can consider this my 'back to keto' post after going off the holidays. Boy that was a mistake! Looking forward to getting rid of this constant heartburn! 

Keto seems scary upfront but there are countless benefits and I hope everyone gets to see them firsthand. If any newbies have any questions feel free to PM me, I'm happy to help. Please note I'm not a doctor and am not authorized to give medical advice üòÖ"
keto,"Amen to that.  I used to compete in a sport where I needed to cut weight (I enjoyed the sport, but I used the weight aspect to hide my own ED), and I was on a super strict keto diet as per my nutritionist.  A few of my teammates and I all worked with the same nutritionist, and we've all since developed restrictive eating habits because of it.

There's a reason this saying is the calling card of the pro-ana sector of the internet.  I never thought I'd see it in this sub.  I've moved to ""stronger, not lighter,"" and I've found that to be a solid replacement."
keto,"I did actually think about keeping either chickens or rabbits for meat, you know! We have a steep-sloped, permaculture garden and veggie patch at the moment, but we live in a very wet part of the world so had a very poor harvest last year. The cost of renovating the garden to keep animals is off-putting. We are fortunate to have a pork and egg farm nearby, but local prices are even steeper."
keto,"Salt and Lite Salt in water, flavored with Mio or squirt of lemon juice. Search for ketoade recipes. There are several here."
keto,"Lol, thanks for the laugh!"
keto,"&gt;you‚Äôll still lose the weight eating more

Nope."
keto,Controversial where? It certainly isn't here.
keto,"\+1 for cronometer. Great database and barcode scanning features. It was tedious entering the recipes at first, though now that I've built up a recipe bank it is very easy. Also, start with the free version. Very few people benefit from the gold/paid version."
keto,Are you my spirit animal?
keto,What‚Äôs the best method of getting them in? Can you recommend supplement or source?
keto,Diet soda is fine and won't affect ketosis.
keto,"All sugars are carbs, so yes, you'd be fine."
keto,I agree with this! The vanilla cherry is excellent. Cream soda is so so to me but still worth trying!
keto,Mine do!  Only because I've been WFH since March and only been wearing Tees.  Now those suits and dress shirts?  That's a different subject lol
keto,"I'm a senior woman trying to lose about 90 lbs on Keto diet.  I have been on the diet for 5 weeks and my  progress has stalled.   The first two weeks I lost 8 lbs, but my weight has stayed the same for the last 3 weeks.  I'm closely following my calculated macros 80g protein, 111g fat, 18g carbs and 1399 total calories.   I have been staying under my carbs and I'm very close on fat, protein and calories.  I have been using a ""breathalyzer"" to test for ketones and it shows either 0, .1 or .2 most of the time.  A couple of times at night it went up to .6 and .95 but it never stays elevated so I don't think I'm in ketosis yet.

I have some personal complications that might be working against me.  Due to spine issues my walking ability is limited and I'm a type II diabetic taking Metformin.   My husband is eating the same meals as me and his breath readings stay above 2.0 continuously.  He is very active and doesn't have diabetes.  He is eating bigger portion sizes than me and is losing weight even though he is not trying to lose anything.  So it appears to me this diet is working for ""normal people"", but not for me.   I would appreciate any suggestions on how to get into ketosis and how to get my weight loss back on track.   Thank You!"
keto,I had high cholesterol and it turned out I was hypothyroid and I didn‚Äôt know.  A sluggish thyroid can lead to high cholesterol.
keto,"Just weighed again for the first time since Nov.  At 260 exactly.  Even in November I was at 244.   Holiday story goes: ""Well I mean its one week before thanksgiving, might as well start early and enjoy the whole week.  Oh leftovers for a week after thanksgiving?.... Well I mean I already did all that damage, its cold out... 3 weeks till Christmas, so let's just candy it up"".   

Now I sit here 40lbs from my GW.   Now I know prolly 10~lbs of that is water because I've been eating a LOT of carbs.   Knowing my body and my activity level I should be at 250~ by this time next week.  Thats when the real weight loss starts.  Now, don't get me wrong, carrying around 10lbs of water is very satisfying to get off as well.  HATE Bloating."
keto,Very recently!
keto,Fair enough. Good stuff though
keto,omg since when did they release a vegan line?? i used to loveeee their light ice cream until i found out i have a slight milk allergy !
keto,Thin is always in..
keto,"This is awesome! Keep up the great work. You‚Äôll have that extra pounds off in no time!

I love saying ‚Äúabs are made in the kitchen‚Äù"
keto,"I know this might be ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù in this sub, but a total of 40-50 grams of protein is extremely low IMO. This may be enough to not have a deficiency (based on the RDA) but might not be the optimal level for you based on your size or activity. 

That being said, the heart palps are most likely electrolytes like others have mentioned. You have to be aggressive especially when you first start, like a gross amount of extra salt (sodium)."
keto,"I know, prices have defo increased, esp formerly super cheap proteins like eggs and tuna. Can you keep chickens for eggs?"
keto,"OMG, that‚Äôs *awesome* results, and in just 2 months! Congratulations! 
It won‚Äôt be long now until you reach your ultimate goal. üòÄ"
keto,Check out Nick‚Äôs vegan ice cream!
keto,"I can think of a few things that could be an issue. First stress, any sudden dietary changes can cause this. Slow down and ease into the new diet. Environmental factors, the most common.  You're in a land away from where you came from for starters which can cause a subconscious level of discomfort.  In addition the world has been kinda messed up for the last year which never helps. Activity levels, have you been keeping up with excercises? This can be a great factor of causing stress. My advice is to take a step back and relax for a day. Clear your head and set your goals. Humans desire order and control but also change which seems contradictory but it's the truth. Without knowing you I can't give more specific advice but I have dealt with anxiety and depression for a long time. The first thing is to accept your feelings and face them. The second is to see what you can change so they don't control you. Good luck!"
keto,I have done the exact same thing and I am now back on keto for another go. I went from 275 to 215 then back to 260 and now I know that keto was the only diet that works for me.
keto,"Gyms are shut, so figured I'd forget the bulk and do a cut to see how lean I can get, and keto is something I've wanted to try for some time now.

I'm on day two. The first day **sucked**. I was mildy hungover to start with, then I was hungry, had a headache all day, tired and thirsty. However I managed to stick to around 20g carbs, ignoring the fibre. Wasn't aware that didn't count so that's good.

Today is already a much improved feeling. No idea if its placebo or whatever but I have a bit more energy, I'm less thirsty and my headache is much more mild. 

I've already leaned some things. 1) I hate spinach. 2) I really quite like asparagus. Admittedly its fried in beef fat, but its tasty, nutritious, and I may just keep it in my diet once I inevitably go off keto.  3) How the hell did avocados get so popular. They're so bloody boring. It's like someone took a kiwi, dried it out and removed all the flavour. Any ideas on how to make it more palatable?

Gonna look for some dessert recipes as I have a big sweet tooth and I'm already missing sugar lmao."
keto,"I‚Äôve heard of lads eating 4 dozen eggs to help them get large, and when they are grown they eat 5 dozen eggs, and are roughly the size of a barge!

Disney jokes aside, probably don‚Äôt need to worry about the eggs from a cholesterol standpoint. You could add in egg whites if you are looking just for protein, and maybe even a low carb whey based (milk) protein powder. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of supplements, but if you are limited on your protein sources it would be better than being protein deficient."
keto,Yeah this post is very triggering. One of the primary problems with keto and other highly restrictive diets is that it can be triggering. Wish there was a way to do keto without reawakening the ED Gods within me.
keto,Lactose intolerance is more of a dietary issue not too race based. Humans have an odd habit of continuing to consume milk past early childhood.cats for example will get incredibly sick if fed anything but dried milk. There are plenty of milks and dairy products that lack lactose entirely as the bacteria in the product eats it away. Just some food for thought.
keto,Absolutely. We live in a very rural area with limited access to supermarkets or deliveries. We're forced to do large weekly or monthly shops for a family of 5. But we do definitely grab the meat in sales and stock up the freezers. And a pantry full of fish and corned beef :) I've been watching the food prices rise for all of 2020. My usual shopping bill has gone up 35%.
keto,"Awesome! I do a low-carb almond milk sometimes, too. Toughest part is that everyone's body chemistry is different. Your microbiome and mine are different, your nutrient uptake is different, hell, even the relative size of our intestines changes the way we're processing calories (so ignore everyone who think it's a simple matter of counting calories in -- we literally burn them differently, body to body).

I just hope that you find something that works for you, and that you continue to have a medical support team that doesn't buy into the ""bipolar can only be managed via medication"" rhetoric. Medication is a tool! Solid nutritional know-how is, too.

Happy 2021. May you find great success with any lifestyle modifications you take on this year."
keto,"Long time ketoer and practicing maintenance since fall 2018... until pandemic hit. I tracked every single day of 2020. I followed my work out routine but the scale crept up. I often felt like I didn't have the mental energy to manage my desire to binge eat. 

Summer 2020 saw me getting my official diagnosis of MS and starting the med was rough as well. Then came the holiday season and even though I tracked, I just didn't care. I started 2020 at 169lbs and ended it at 184 lbs. 

My pants and bras don't fit anymore. But a pro is that I have kept up with weight training and this ""bulk"" has helped me hit some new gains. 

I love what one single day of keto and a calorie deficit has done. Not stuffing myself to the brim yesterday had me waking up 4lbs lighter today. Cheers to the new year and regaining lost ground!!"
keto,Winning!!!!!!!
keto,"Same, at the height of my anorexia."
keto,"For the people who are new to keto, don‚Äôt forget that you are also dumping electrolytes when this is happening. Make sure you are replacing these as much as possible to avoid headaches, dizziness, fatigue and other symptoms of electrolyte imbalance."
keto,"I‚Äôve actually done low carb for decades now because eating carbs makes me feel bloated and also makes me super hungry. 

I go full keto when I want to drop weight quickly. I‚Äôve dropped 20 pounds a couple of times, but I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm at a weight that feels comfortable, so I just eat mostly keto because of the energy and health benefits. 

Every time I go full keto, I also add in more exercise than normal: usually walking miles and miles every day on vacation (20,000 to 30,000 steps a day), which obviously also means the CICO equation is massively tilted towards the calories out!"
keto,Yay for progress! You got this!
keto,"I like the way you think! This buddy system is pretty awesome! I think there is a lot of truth in what you said that nothing will taste as good as you remember it tasting. On my chest day, I was unbelievably happy with the first few bites of my food, and then I was like ""hmm was it really worth it? Now I just feel heavy and not really happier at all"" üòÑ so a few bites ""from buddy"" would do the trick for sure!"
keto,"I agree. If we just avoid the rice/rotis/parathas, Indian food is very easy to enjoy on keto. Just get familiar with the carb impact of various veggies, and you‚Äôre set. I haven‚Äôt tried using mooli instead of aloo, but a lot of recipes seem to do that, and if you try it out, I‚Äôd love to know if the flavour is an acceptable substitute. More than the rice and grains, I miss plain old aloo. What can I say? I grew up eating poori-aloo most days! For now I just avoid aloo altogether until I decide to have a cheat day, and then you can bet I‚Äôll be doing a poori-aloo breakfast. 

Patra ... I‚Äôve eaten it, never made it myself. I looked it up on Google, and it looks like it has 32 grams of carbs per hundred grams of patra, so ... no, not keto. But there are so many other Indian foods you *can* eat that are absolutely delicious."
keto,"The easiest list with keto is what to avoid.

Grains: Bread, pasta, oatmeal, wheat, bulgar, rye, rice, quinoa

Vegetables: Beans, corn, potatoes, high starch vegetables like yams, carrots, and winter squash. Onions only in small amounts.

Fruit: Most of them, unfortunately. A good rule of tumb is if tastes sweet...it's out! The exceptions to this are berries. Non-sweet fruits such as cucumbers, summer squash, and eggplant are allowed, though be mindful of portions with things like tomatoes because they are relatively high in carb. I, and a lot of other people still eat them, but you have to be careful how much!

Sweeteners: Sugar, honey, agave syrup, fructose, maple syrup, maltitol (maltitol is technically keto, but, trust me, avoid it! Your toilet will thank you!)

Dairy: Animal milk because it's high in sugar (cream is okay), oat milk, rice milk"
keto,I ended up changing it yesterday to 1435 and at the end of the day it turned out I only ate a total of 1243 cals. Thanks tho
keto,Why do you drink so much  water?
keto,"Hi.  Correlation is not causation, but, yes, I had high cholesterol numbers when I had both strokes.  I stay out of the ""cholesterol debates"" that rage in this forum.....just saying that, with your numbers, speaking for myself, I would ask my PCP to refer me to a great cardiologist (best if you can find a good interventional cardiologist) and go get checked out for heart disease.  A cardiac stress test is no big deal and can be telling......best of luck!"
keto,Collagen powder is not complete protein and should not be counted toward protein macro per FAQ.
keto,"Looks pretty good, though your deficit is a bit high.

keto,Is there an alternative to cake for your son‚Äôs party? Maybe some fresh berries?
keto,"Hey there, can anyone let me know if eating that much fat can harm? I have a cholesterols problem in family. M little concerned with taking so much fat."
keto,"What is the expectation of your son?  Is it important to him?  If so then calculate the macros and make it fit. He wouldn‚Äôt notice if you only ate a few bites of cake. 

If he doesn‚Äôt care, then make a keto dessert to enjoy. If the keto treat isn‚Äôt something you want, then foregoing it will be easy. 

However, if this is a potential stumbling block, then avoid it all together.  We‚Äôre all coming from different strengths and weaknesses, you need to do what works for you.

Happy Birthday to your son!!!"
keto,"Well if you ate them and liked them, I don't see any reason it wouldn't work!"
keto,"Heh this is accurate. I even lowered my caffeine intake - drank 1 cup of coffee and 1 Coke zero today, but still had about a million bathroom breaks. 

I hope that‚Äôs a good sign."
keto,"Well, you probably don't want to hear this but my advice would return that box of snakeoil for a refund and just eat real food.

Keto doesn't require exogenous ketones.

The only special supplements you might need are potassium (can be bought in the grocery store as Lite Salt or NuSalt) and magensium."
keto,Same!  I‚Äôve found this a great way to not feel so deprived
keto,Lose It!
keto,It‚Äôs very easy to fall into temptation early on when starting keto. It‚Äôs not worth it. I remember giving myself a ‚Äòcheat meal‚Äô when I first started and had a grilled cheese and tomato soup. Afterwards I felt incredibly guilty and anger at myself for giving in.
keto,"Could still be it, unfortunately. I am ~\**sparkle*\*~ white and I am still, alas, lactose intolerant. Experiment with it for a bit."
keto,"I think if I had to choose between dying slightly earlier and giving up the 2 cups of coffee I drink in the morning, I would just go ahead and choose dying earlier."
keto,"Keep it under 150? I assume that‚Äôs $$, but is that per month? Paycheck? Week?"
keto,I have no idea.  I was just using it as an example for the substitutes.  I am sure you can consume it.  I was more referring to trying to chase that replacement ghost.
keto,Good luck on the restart!!!!
keto,"Uhh at the start of the year my PCOS symptoms were out of control. Hormones affect everything, devastating to realize in my 30s after my clueless twenties. This year I went keto, stopped snacking and eat 2 or 3 meals in a 5-8 hr window. Hallelujah I am my old self. NO symptoms. Before, fatigue/sleeping issues (insomnia or needing 500 hours of sleep to feel human), digestion/IBS issues, hair loss, heavy or missing periods, no ovulation or sex drive, depression and anxiety, a fucking 35 year eczema patch on my right thigh. I really don‚Äôt miss those health problems, the depression+carb treatment cycle was excruciating . HORMONES, I used to roll my eyes when menopausal women talked about hormones but hormones matter and mine are fine again on keto."
keto,I‚Äôm on that app too but haven‚Äôt used it in years!  Thank you! I will check it out too!
keto,"Of course it isn't suitable for everyone, plenty of people can't, but its not a matter of who its a matter of certainty, how, and what to expect. But if you are physically able this isn't some snake oil shit. The concern isn't if its good for everyone its more so that often times people do not realize the body will canabalize its own muscle with the fat. If you are able to mitigate it knowing is half the battle. Lifting at a gym is just honestly the easiest way to achieve that mitigation. Between source materials- resources etc its easy.

So many times I hear people honestly unhappy asking what to do after cutting for X months or years and wondering what the hell is going on. That they thought it would be better only to realize they shrank a lot and a fair amount was lean mass since they avoided lifting. Further discovering on the internet how fat is actually easy to lose and muscle is hard to gain. Now gaining back what you lost to help fill that skin is going to F with em because they have to get fatter in order to build mass to fill the loose skin. A mind F. I honestly feel bad for ppl in that situation."
keto,"Was it just the ‚Äòstandard‚Äô cholesterol test or has he had you take an advanced lipid panel where they measure the size of the LDL particles?  Also, how much coffee and/or alcohol do you drink?

keto,I‚Äôm calling the CEO of Google right now
keto,"I was up about 30 pounds this year, but I'm tall so it's not overly dramatic. Have a long history of yo-yoing tho and am now halfway back down to 200 pounds which is where I feel best. 

I'm doing IF, comfortable with a 19/5 split. Cut sugar intake by a lot, no soda, a bit of dark chocolate, eat apple and mango sometimes, coffee is black now instead of the beloved sweet cappuccinos. Making hot chocolates with Stevia a lot, good stuff (Stevia in coffee doesn't work for me). Every second day I avoid all carbs, eating meat, veggies and salad, which is satisfying enough. 

At least 30 mins of exercise daily, pushing that up to an hour now on many days, part cardio, part hatha yoga, serves me well. 

Just recently found out about keto, but where I live it's pretty hard to get many of the ingredients needed for many of the dishes. Will try it at some point tho, I like the science behind it, pushing the body's ability to burn fat.

Good luck and endurance to y'all, a happy, healthy and disaster free 2021!"

For me this time is a little different because, with help, I realized that I was, in a way, using food to self harm. Therapy helps and I am not going to lie talking to someone about eating too much is really weird but totally worth it."

I've never given glucomannan a shot. Maybe I will."
keto,Ill be your weight loss buddy üòå
keto,"Lots and lots of progress pics.  Looking back at unrecognizable photos of me at 300 made me realize just how far I had come.  Plus, I have a really supportive wife."
keto,"One good thing is that 89 cent bag of lentils at the grocery market can be sprouted.  Takes about 7 days.  Cheap.  Nutritious.    

Also, many people here will mention meats and how to work meats into a keto diet.  Not many will mention grilling meats ads a whole different layer of flavor."
keto,"Absolutely!

keto,"Keto weightloss pro tip: Recalc your macros every ten pound loss or so.

Smaller bodies burn fewer calories."
keto,It could be that your stomach is not recognizing when you've eaten enough.  At those times try a hot tea or sipping at hot lemon water.
keto,So I'm a month in and I want a cheat day for NYE. Any advice on how to handle the cheat meals or get back into it come the first? I realize I'm probably going right back into the flu so I'll try to keep hydration in mind.
keto,"You're asking about Carnivore in the Keto sub. Try r/carnivore , r/carnivorediet , and r/zerocarb.

&amp;#x200B;

Really though it depends on how strict you are about carnivore. When I'm going pretty much fully Carnivore I still eat mustard, which is plant based. When I'm leaning more Keto than Carnivore I eat a lot of home made mayonnaise."
keto,"Please, give us ref to the lupin+glucomannan pasta :-)"
keto,"Personally, i feel like at best I had disorder ""tendencies"", so i m not sure how qualified i am to comment on this.

However, i feel keto helped me a lot to have a healthy relationship with food. And i think that a big driver of eating disorders is a negative feedback-loop, i.e., i fast/work/suffer a lot to loose weight and when I cheat i gain it back very fast, therefore, cheating is super bad and I need to diet/fast/work/suffer even more. Over time, i develop the association of suffering with eating. Again, that's ONE of probably many drivers. However, since keto makes it super easy to loose weight, it becomes a minor problem to cheat and thus, removes that driver."
keto,Fuck....you look like your own nephew. Good work kid
keto,"I miss pizza, I discovered I was allergic to tomatoes when  I first started keto. ‚òπÔ∏è

I know it's not the same, but...
-Naruto roll (cucumber wrapped sushi with no rice)
-Nori (seaweed) wrap, throw some sushi grade fish (or tuna with kwepie mayo and siracha) and any of the veggie fillings you like (I liked picked radish and/or cucumbers for the crunch) you can also add avocado and/or cream cheese. Basically avoid the rice and imitation crab/lobster and you're good."
keto,Eat to maintenance. Make some fat bombs.
keto,Man do I ever hear you.  I also tried so many so called Ketogenic Foods and it was all bland and tasteless.  So I decided it this is going to work I need to just eat what I like.  So lots of green salads with eggs and cheese and bacon. Lots of eggs. Lots of chicken and on occasion beef. And found a few things that actually tasted good and are zero or 1-2 carbs.  Twin peaks makes an amazing cheese puff balls that are only one carb fir a cup.  Good evening snack if feeling hungry.  But yes. I no longer buy all that worthless junk. And stay away from whole foods. Most of thier keto stuff isn't
keto,Nobody here said that
keto,"Never feel bloated or slow or sick like ever. I feel normal. I don‚Äôt know how else to describe it. I‚Äôm learning what it‚Äôs like to consistently feel the same throughout the day (unless I fast for too long or forget to eat when working and being manic about cleaning or a task) 

It makes me even more adamant about watching what I eat cause I never want that sluggish bloated feeling ever again."
keto,1000 calories is way too low. You shouldn't go below 1200. Maybe try a 2 week diet break (Matador method) to reset your metabolism. I've taken plenty of diet breaks and it's made the weight loss more consistent
keto,On-point. I took a 2-3 month diet break (all I did was count carbs to make sure I was in keto) and yeah just going slow really helps also make it more consistent with the last 10 pounds that body stubbornly refuses to lose
keto,Spinach and mushrooms should be good low carb veggies.
keto,"For electrolyte  replacement, yes."
keto,So Gatorade zero bad?
keto,"Gatorade is flavored water with a trace of electrolytes. It's no where near what you need.

keto,"I thought I was gonna hit my macros and stay keto on Christmas. Then, I smashed back a bunch of cookies and pumpkin pie because DGAF. Being in keto really isn't a big deal, but honestly if it's doing that to your mental health then just add fruit and move up to low carb or, like I do now, TKD/carb cycling.

&amp;#x200B;

As a dude, I understand this shit is nowhere near the same, but tbh if anything keto's solved disordered eating. If, however, you don't think that it's best for your mental health long term, then it's not worth doing. Keto isn't a religion or be all end all of healthy eating."
keto,Congratulation!!  This is so AMAZING! Thanks for the sharing
keto,[https://www.ketoconnect.net/keto-budget/](https://www.ketoconnect.net/keto-budget/)
keto,I drink those Atkins shakes. You can find them pretty much anywhere. Pretty good for on the go because I‚Äôm usually running late üòÇ.
keto,Wow!
keto,"I needed to read this, thank you."
keto,"You don't have to completely give up fruit, and its ok to relax the carb limit every once in awhile. I am completely grain free, but every 3rd weekend when I go home ill eat whatever they make with the exception of grains. Were having meatloaf and mashed potatoes perfectly ok. Sure I come out of ketosis and if I keep it up more than 2 or 3 days the hunger cravings come back, but for the most part I can move in and out of keto fairly easily.

As far as fruit just fit it into your macros. Oranges, apples and berries tend to be my fruits of choice. I can have a small orange and not mess up my day. Or a handful of blueberries. Or an apple with some almond butter is one of my bedtime snacks."
keto,"Great, thank you! I am ordering their variety pack. I see they have keto cornbread mix, too!"
keto,"Yea the serving size of this cereal is like half of the other cereals. I usually have two servings with a cup of unsweetened almond milk and I find it quite filling. No gas or bloating!
It is quite pricy  but worth it when you crave cereal
And I love that its zero net carbs.
You should check their reviews on Amazon"
keto,Stay away from that stuff add a little sea salt and K1000 to water you‚Äôll be good to go
keto,Bet bro I‚Äôm gonna buy some Gatorade zeros tomorrow then
keto,"You need electrolytes, headaches are never a good sign."
keto,"Dads are amazing. I miss mine, and he would have benefited from keto. Taking my mom to the keto dark side as part of our new year resolution deal‚Äîkeeping it simple for her, just no sugar no grains to start. She still thinks Cheerios are a healthy breakfast and that eggs have too much cholesterol, long held misbeliefs, so we are easing into the diet changes.  We did have a great Christmas Eve dinner, lamb and mashed potatoes and gravy (lol, had two bites) and roasted veggies without dessert. We get to be examples of better health for those we love. Oh yeah, my part of my New Years deal with my mom is giving up my ‚Äúsocial smoking‚Äù habit of 20 years, shit‚Äôs about to get real. Happy new year. :)"
keto,"Try monk fruit sweetener. It is so similar to sugar in taste, my family can‚Äôt tell the difference. That may be your key to cutting the sugar. 

And look around your local area. Many bakery‚Äôs selling keto treats are popping up. In my area, a mom and daughter that are keto starting selling from their home because 1. Buying all the ingredients can be expensive to make just one recipe. 2. Most places use stevia as a sugar sub for cost reasons and that shits gross

I order stuff from them now at the same cost of buying a regular item from a bakery, and way cheaper than making myself and hoping it turns out. 

I‚Äôve gotten ding dong cakes (google it. Omg), German chocolate, French silk pie, cookies, cupcakes of all kinds. Just have to do some searching. It‚Äôs much better finding things now vs a few years ago. I‚Äôm approaching 2 years of keto and maintaining a 135 lb loss."
keto,"I know this in my head, but my heart (&amp; stomach) says cereal... or cold &amp; sweet  lol 

Just one of those things I have to re-program"
keto,"Ugh. The Kirkland quest bars are my weakness. But thanks to this sub, I‚Äôve seen that multiple diabetic people have reported that they‚Äôre potentially not very low carb. This info makes it easier for me to not want to stock them in the pantry!"
keto,Blue diamond garlic almonds from Costco. Gotta be a garlic fan because these are intense but OMG so good.
keto,"Stop thinking of breakfast as a time for only certain foods. You can have anything that fits your macros. Leftover chicken, (keto) pizza, lox, shrimp, steak, whatever. Chicken salad? Tuna salad? SPAM salad? Crab salad? Shrimp salad? They all go good in a lettuce wrap.

I often have a [cheesewich](https://imgur.com/a/Eq1aXt0) as my first meal of the day.

I never know if ""non-cooked"" means no microwave cooking as well? There's a lot of things you can make within minutes using the microwave -- hard-boiled eggs, omelets, cream cheese pancakes, sausages, ""hot pockets"", etc."
keto,43 here and ditto!
keto,Holy crap that's amazing!
keto,"Okay, I'm looking at their website, and I want to ask a question or two. Based on their serving size, which is half a cup, do you feel full for a long time after eating it? Or does it make you want to eat more? You could probably eat a whole cup, but then you burn through the cereal faster, and it's pretty pricey. And with the allulose, do you get any gas or bloating?"
keto,Mustard (which is zero carb and zero calories) as well?
keto,i saw someone post like 3 days ago. the switch might have been since the ones you got and different stores i guess might have old stock lasting longer

keto,"&gt; he goes ‚Äúlook it up there‚Äôs people who eat fries on keto‚Äù and so I did and the first thing that popped up was how they couldn‚Äôt be farther from low carb

Actually, the latest keto fad is Heavenly Fan's French Fries, made with either almond flour or coconut flour:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJU_5DNYiqg

From the text of the YouTube page:

***

INGREDIENTS
--------------------
**Almond fries**:
* 100g ground almonds (you can use finer almond flour but the texture will be denser and crunchier)
* 3 tsp xanthan gum (or konjac powder if you have it!)
* 6 tbsp hot water

**Coconut flour fries**:
* 50g coconut flour
* 3 tsp xanthan gum (or konjac powder)
* 7-8 tbsps hot water

DIRECTIONS
-------------------
1. Place ground almonds (or coconut flour) and xanthan gum in a mixing bowl, mix well. Add in hot water and mix/knead the dough till all the ingredients are blended together. Leave to rest for 15 minutes.

2. Roll out the dough till it reaches 1/4 cm thickness, cut it into slim strips (French fries shapes).

3. In a frying pan, add in a generous amount of oil (enough to cover the fries). Maintain medium to low heat. Gently place the dough strips in the pan and fry them till they are golden brown on all sides.

4. Transfer the fries to a plate lined with kitchen towels (to remove access oil). Sprinkle with Himalayan salt or sea salt. And enjoy x

Oven method:

Place the dough strips on a baking tray (lined with baking sheet and greased with oil). Brush a generous amount of oil on top of the to-be French fries and bake in a 200¬∞C/400¬∞F preheated oven till the fries are golden brown (10-15mins). Toss the fries around in between to make sure they bake evenly on all sides.


EASY GARLIC DIP
-------------------------
* Vegan mayonnaise (or thick vegan yoghurt)
* Crushed garlic
* Finely chopped parsley
* A squeeze of lemon

Mix all ingredients together (if you‚Äôre using vegan yoghurt, add some salt to season). And enjoy"

keto,Did he lose much weight doing keto and consuming potatoes during that?
keto,how did you cope with dark times
keto,"Focus on carbs first then worry about calories. It will happen naturally sometimes. I know when I am in ketosis I will most days eat less than 1000 calories. That includes my bulletproof coffee too lol. The 2 or 3 days it takes for me to get to that point tho, I eat closer to 3000 calories. According to the calorie counter I should eat around 2000 to still lose weight, but im lucky if I break 1800 once im in ketosis"
keto,"I have been following the keto diet for a while now. I have started a channel where I will go over all the foods Vegans, Vegetarians, Non-Vegetarian, Pescetarian can eat in Keto Diet. Currently, the channel is in Hindi. I am trying to come up with the English version. Please follow my channel to know more about it.

keto,"What do you eat with ajvar? Hadn‚Äôt heard of it before, it looks really tasty."
keto,hard disagree as someone with hashimoto's this weight lifting obsession culturally right now is *not* suitable for all. i get flares if i push myself so long moderate walks are my go-to to avoid flare-ups and keep weight loss moving.
keto,Coffee with 100 g of cream.
keto,"Two Good or Ratio yogurt.  Sometimes I mix in some protein powder as well.  Or sometimes I'll just have a protein shake, usually a pre-made Premier Protein one.  

Its a bit pricey for what it is but Ore Ida has these microwavable cups called Just Crack an Egg.  the ""Protein Packed Scramble"" is just cheese/sausage/bacon.  But all you do is open it, crack an egg in there, microwave it and then eat it right out of the cup.  No effort and no mess."
keto,"i disagree. Doing your best is much more sustainable mindset long-term for anything to diet, career, relational goals and general growth. Otherwise we run the risk of putting a solitary goal on a pedestal while holistically other important areas of life fall to shit at the expense of that one goal."
keto,"Oh good god, he‚Äôs my age üòÇ I was picturing my (very overweight) 70 year old dad doing something similar and saw the humour, but now I just feel old üòù"

keto,"I can‚Äôt say anything about how much you will feel the process of becoming fat adapted, but I can tell you that I didn‚Äôt notice much, till I noticed the ways I was feeling better.

keto,Sometimes. I just listento my body and eat till I'm full then go right back into OMAD or a two day fast.
keto,"Wow, that's some killer progress.  Way to go!  With the frequent 3 day fasts, do you eat more calories on your non-fasting days  to make up for the missed calories from fasting?"
keto,It's about 2 years giver or take a few months. And yes the picture on the right is the before. :)
keto,"Heinz makes low sugar ketchup. Mayo, most mustards (avoid honey mustard, obviously) things like sauerkraut or kim chi are great with meats.

How long between the two pics? Looks like a decade! Good on ya. Keep it up bro."
keto,"Be careful with cheese or nuts. 

In my case, I limit my purchase of cheeses to cheeses that I don't love. And I only buy enough to last me a couple of days. This prevents me from overindulging. 

And for nuts, I only get the unsalted kind and I only buy one tiny little pack of nuts every couple of weeks. Whenever I buy a bigger quantity, I just finish the container in one sitting."
keto,A teaspoon of red miso has 1g net carbs and a very distinctive pungent flavor which can make your vinaigrette or even the cooking liquids in your pan into a nice sauce.
