Hi everyone, 

I am losing weight but also doing high intensity workouts. 

After the workout I feel extreme hunger. 

If I eat a big meal before workout then that takes up a lot of calories for the day and doesn't allow me for a good dinner. 

If I don't eat much before workout then I start getting hungary towards the end of the session and really hungary after. 

This has been causing me to fall off track from my diet. 

Any advice? Any specific nutrition I might be missing? Any ideas would be helpful. Cheers.

Argument to authority.

Experts may often be right, but they are right because of the quality of their arguments, not because they are experts. 

\&gt;You did not link to a study showing that saturated fat is harmless. Those studies just showed that replacing saturated fat with Omega-6 vegetable oil is no better.

Very specifically, in that study they saw the expected reduction in LDL but did not see a benefit in mortality. AND the investigators chose not to publish the results of their study because it did not show the results that they wanted.

\&gt; What exactly are you looking for? Do you want a study that shows that eating more plant-based will result in a longer life? The Adventist 2 trial is good for that. 

From [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4191896/) (emphasis mine):

Vegetarian diets **are associated with** lower all-cause mortality and with some reductions in cause-specific mortality. Results appeared to be more robust in males. These favorable associations should be considered carefully by those offering dietary guidance. 

Not only is this an observational study - and therefore does not who causation - the hazard ratios are tiny and many span unity.

nutrition,"From [health.harvard](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/artificial-sweeteners-sugar-free-but-at-what-cost-201207165030):

&gt;And there are other health concerns beside cancer. In the [Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/32/4/688), daily consumption of diet drinks was associated with a 36% greater risk for metabolic syndrome and a 67% increased risk for type 2 diabetes. Aren’t these diseases that artificial sweeteners may help prevent in the first place?

I’ve yet to see a study say A.S. are a healthy food recommended for ppl to enjoy. The consensus is they can be okay in small amounts if theyre tolerated, but most studies with regular consumption by participants shows they’re linked to unhealthy results. Hence, bad for you.

From you

&gt;Overall, the use of artifical sweeteners poses few risk to human health, and generally aids in fat loss, blood sugar control and dental health when used as a substitute for added sugar.

“Poses few risks” is doing a lot of work; it cedes that there ARE risks (how many fake sweeteners have been pulled from the market, associated with cancer risk, etc) to them, which already means they’re dangerous. (Apples don’t “pose any risk”) Comparing artificial sweeteners with sweeteners does not mean the A.S. are good, it merely means they are less bad. That’s an important distinction. It’s better to have a cookie than a big piece of cake with ice cream, but that doesn’t mean a cookie is good for you.

I don’t buy that people need any sweetener in their diet and so I don’t accept your premise that it’s better to have A.S. than natural sugars, neither are good.

Further: the baseline of any healthy diet is to avoid processed foods, that’s step one. A.S. is a literal process of chemicals, there’s nothing natural or whole about them. Thus, as a chemical concoction designed to trick the body into tasting sweet, it’s a garbage food that has no place - literally useless - in a healthy diet"
nutrition,"I have learned a lot about my body through cutting out certain things. I have so much more energy today, and I never have headaches or sinus issues anymore. 

It all changed when I cut out wheat and dairy.
I never eat wheat or dairy now.. and I avoid absolutely all artificial sweeteners/flavors/colors. I also try to avoid “natural flavors” if I can. And I never eat much more than 100grams of protein a day.. and I’m 235lbs and 6’1”. I’ve found that I don’t need it, and I feel so much better (I even grow better) without that much.

I used to eat a lot things like pizza and milk, I quit cold turkey and had the worst sinus headaches for 2 weeks. Never touched them again and I can breathe like never before.
As for artificial sweeteners, I had a terrible experience with Splenda that really screwed up a large part of my early life. I implore everyone to stay away from artificial everything. I won’t get into it.. but I am dead serious.

Since I quit those I only buy unflavored herb and supplement powders, usually in bulk. I mix them all in a blender once every 3-6 months, then scoop the mix into a blate pape twice a day and swallow it.

nutrition,"**TLDR**; If you are only looking for skin benefits, you may likely get similar visible results from both collagen and gelatin.

While both are good for digestion, gut repair, skin, hair, nails, joints, and bone health, there are differences between collagen (a.k.a. Collagen Peptides / Collagen Hydrolysate / Hydrolyzed Collagen Peptides) and gelatin.

* Collagen peptides will dissolve in both hot and cold liquids and are faster digesting than gelatin.
* Gelatin requires warm water to dissolve.
* Collagen will not form a gel, gelatin will.
* Processing techniques and where/how the product was sourced can make a difference in bioavailability.

nutrition,"Soaking your beans helps them cook faster and more evenly, and it can also make them easier to digest. If you add salt to the soaking water (in other words, make a brine), your beans will cook even faster; the salt helps break down their skins. Here are a few methods; choose the one that best fits your schedule. And keep in mind that you never need to soak legumes like lentils or split peas.

1. **Overnight Soaking**  
To soak beans the traditional way, cover them with water by 2 inches, add 2 tablespoons coarse kosher salt (or 1 tablespoon fine salt) per pound of beans, and let them soak for at least 4 hours or up to 12 hours. Drain them and rinse before using.
2. **Quick Soaking**  
Another option is quick-soaking, which allows you to make a pot of beans within a few hours flat without sacrificing flavor or texture. Put the beans in a pot on the stove, cover with water by two inches, add salt if you like, and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and let them soak for an hour. Drain, rinse and proceed with your recipe.
3. **Or don't soak at all**  
Here’s a secret you may not know: You don’t actually have to soak your beans at all. Just add them to your pot and plan on cooking your recipe for another hour or two beyond the usual cooking time. Keep an eye on the level of liquid, adding more water, broth or stock if the pot looks dry. There should always be liquid covering your beans as they cook."

nutrition,"Some studies show that saturated fat intake raises blood cholesterol levels, but these studies are almost always short-term, lasting only a few weeks. Longer-term studies have not shown an association between saturated fat intake and blood cholesterol levels. In fact, of all of the long-term studies examining the effects of fats on blood status, only one of them showed a clear association between saturated fat intake and cholesterol levels, and even that association was weak.

Moreover, studies on low-carbohydrate diets (which tend to be high in saturated fat) suggest that they not only don’t raise blood cholesterol, they have several beneficial impacts on cardiovascular disease risk markers. For example, a meta-analysis of 17 low-carb diet trials covering 1,140 obese patients published in the journal Obesity Reviews found that low-carb diets neither increased nor decreased LDL cholesterol. However, they did find that low-carb diets were associated with significant decreases is body weight as well as improvements in several CV risk factors, including decreases in triglycerides, fasting glucose, blood pressure, body mass index, abdominal circumference, plasma insulin and c-reactive protein, as well as an increase in HDL cholesterol."

When it comes to collagen products, the biggest functional difference between a gelatin product and a collagen product is that the collagen product is usually a more purified product.

Some people opt to purchase gelatin as it tends to be cheaper than collagen products. Functionally there will not be much of a difference.

Having said that, there's very little research supporting the use of collagen as a skincare supplement. This is likely due, in large part, to how easy it is for the body to make new collagen. Generally speaking, a diet with adequate protein and adequate vitamin C intake will make sufficient collagen."

Dutch kale/boerenkool has been exposed to the frost on purpose (in the netherlands they do this in the factory) so the texture changes a little bit, so perhaps if this hasn't been done it has to be boiled longer to get the right texture. But in that case frozen kale heated up in a pan works perfectly fine."

If you know where the soil is from, you can look up whether that area is known to have high levels of arsenic, for example, but most places just aren't testing soil levels of heavy metals because for the most part, they aren't causing symptoms. Because testing is expensive and only can be done in certain labs, which requires shipping material, etc., it just isn't done. There are programs to help homeowners test well water, for example, though, so there IS something if you feel that you really need to--if you are relying entirely on this source of vegetables or if you have a well. Or if you're having symptoms of heavy metal poisoning and want to figure it out. 

If you really want to get testing, you could pool your soil, get that tested, if it's negative you're all good, if not, you will need to test each part individually.

Then there's genetics. Around half of peoples conversion is 50 percent worse, and half of those people has the conversion cut by 75 percent. Does that sound like plants are a good source? 

Toxicity fears come from explorers eating seal or polar bear liver which is sky high in vitamin A compared to other animal liver. 4 ounces of liver a week is perfectly safe and you can take higher doses of vitamin A than usual if you keep the other fat soluble vitamins, K, E and D higher as well so they're in balance.

The fact is people were shorter, and more likely to suffer severe malnutrition before our current food supply status.  When you were broke,  there was no SNAP,  WIC or other social nets to help.   If you go by what the privileged class could afford, then yes it most likely was better,  but the average working class family did not have access to those dietary benefits.  Nor did even the wealthy understand nutrition like we do now."
nutrition,thats not true
nutrition,"Here's a handy chart, for future reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid_ratio_in_food

Even drained, sardines in olive oil are 2.1:1, under the 4:1 ratio, but hardly *way* under, and considering pretty much everything else has a significantly higher ratio a 2:1 ratio isn't going to change things much. The list doesn't have sardines in water, but IIRC they're very similar to mackerel, so say a ~1:13 ratio, which will do a lot more than a 2:1 ratio to correct things."
nutrition,yeah
nutrition,"I dont disagree. But it doesn't mean you're more or less healthier than those with different body shapes or weights. 

The point of the statement was that we need to move away from looking at someone and making a judgement on their health. On both sides of the coin.

Yes, being overweight or obese can come with its own issues, but being involved in other health supporting activities can overcome or reverse those risks whilst maintaining some level of shape and size. 

You could be heavier than me. But if youre involved in healthy activity as well you could very well be healthier than me too. 

And let's not forget that whilst being healthy is objectively the absence of disease, its not just about how biologically healthy you are. There are additional components too. Mental and social. These also impact your overall health.  

Despite this our society still only cares and makes judgements upon how heavy you are. Or how fat you look. 

So, i standby the statement that your body composition doesn't dictate how healthy you are."
nutrition,"Well high LDL cholesterol isn’t necessarily healthy and that’s been confirmed even with Mendelian randomization (genetically low LDL is protective against heart disease and genetically high LDL increases risk of heart disease). 

&gt; Recent findings: Mendelian randomization studies consistently demonstrate that LDL-C is causally associated with the risk of CHD. Furthermore, exposure to genetically mediated lower LDL-C appears to be associated with a much greater than expected reduction in CHD risk, thus suggesting that LDL-C has a cumulative effect on the risk of CHD. In addition, genetically mediated lower LDL-C is log-linearly associated with the risk of CHD and the effect of polymorphisms in multiple different genes on the risk of CHD is remarkably consistent when measured per unit lower LDL-C.

Summary: The naturally randomized genetic evidence suggests that LDL-C has a causal and cumulative effect on the risk of CHD, and that the clinical benefit of exposure to lower LDL-C is determined by the absolute magnitude of exposure to lower LDL-C independent of the mechanism by which LDL-C is lowered.

nutrition,It’s barely any though it’s less than the omega 3 it contains. I mean your diet must be awful if you’re getting that much omega 6. They recommend 4:1 for health and sardines in olive oil are way over that ratio. And taste way better than in water. You know you drain the oil right?

My diet isn't great. A lot of diet soda, big portions (like 5 cups of fried rice for dinner lol but still around calorie goal).

Been gaining a bit of weight, about 12lbs. 230lbs now at 6 feet. Lowest was 180lbs, but I am best at 215lbs personally. Thoughts? Is it mostly probably the weight gain? Time to cut?"
nutrition,"It's the ratio that matters more most times. If you're eating sardines to get more omega 3 fatty acids, then adding extra omega 6 fatty acids defeats that purpose. It doesn't matter if olive oil is low in omega 6 (relative to other oils, not in general) it's still something like a 10:1 ratio of omega 6 to omega 3. So, if you are trying to get more omega 3 (and if you're doing this you're generally also trying to reduce omega 6), why would you add unnecessary omega 6?

Meta analyses look at all of the studies on a topic, exclude ones with low level of significance or ones with statistically or methodological errors, and then look at results of all the individual studies.

nutrition,Yes yes yes yes!!
nutrition,They are so good when baked with a little cinnamon

nutrition,"Yep, like others have said,  just a good amount of fresh fruits and veggies every day."
nutrition,In the 1800s they didn't even have the technology to process meat into hotdogs. They ate sausages then that later evolved into what we now call hotdogs.
nutrition,"I'll let you in a little secret: Oat Fiber

I purchase Oat Fiber from Amazon (Naturtronix brand) at least twice monthly. It is made from grinding the oat ""shell"" and is almost entirely insoluble fiber. In other words, zero-calorie ""100%"" fiber. 

I add Oat Fiber to my Anabolic French Toast bake and sometimes to my scrambled eggs. It keeps me full all day long, my trips to the bathroom are quite productive, and it became a staple in my diet after discovering it. I highly recommend incorporating it, give the different brands a try, and I hope it is what you were looking for."

nutrition,"It’s difficult to find in stores in my area, I just had to order online. But I’m sticking with it because it’s 1 or 2 g carbs per serving, pretty low calorie. It’s thicker than necessary so I can dilute with water to make it last longer. Second favorite is Oat milk. Super tasty, lots of carbs, no omegas as far as I know."
nutrition,"I agree, with the availability of healthy food being greater than ever before. But its if people use it healthily, or if they douse it in oil before deep frying/using it in healthy meals at all. Our way of cooking has evolved, as well as calorie intake.

Fresh vegetables opposed to canned are incomparable, and I think its more probably back then more worth it to make the most of what fresh ingredients you have rather than let them rot or throw them out a bit early like most modern companies do now. It was probably more the usual to buy local fresh ingredients back then too as townships were localised (eg. You could ask for eggs from a neighbour and be given fresh eggs) and not every ingredient was from a corporation like it is today.

The increase of price for lower quality foods with added chemicals, sugars, saturated fats, preservatices, colours etc. Has played an enormous part in how people eat today, compared to buying food decades ago and bring provided standard ingredients with no added anything."

nutrition,"We do know more about nutrition, however cheaper and faster food (canned or prepacked) may look or sound healthy when it isn't. We also have a wider range of foods from various nations that we identify with being 'healthy' when it really isn't, such as dumplings or indian curries. Back in the day and upon reading teen girls' magazines from the 70's which are packed on how to 'stay slim' it was more based on what to eat to stay relatively healthy, now we have salads which include feta or the dressing as mayonnaise and labelled as healthy. The illusion of healthy put into processed sugary and fatty foods (like subway) in these modern times is seriously incredible. Healthy was easier back then as it was what was available; now whats available is so many options with no seeing on what extras are included in our foods."

Hi everyone,

recently I've been experiencing a strange feeling of tiredness, especially in the afternoon and especially after a meal, no matter what exactly I eat. It's mostly manifested in my legs, a strange feeling of fatigue. The worst thing is that I play Football (Soccer) and I have training and games mostly at that time of the day.

Did anyone else experience something like this? Could it be due to something nutrition related?"

I grew up with them, lots of physical activity but it was fun. But Id sometimes get cereal just because it was easier and quicker to do. When there was no rush it was eggs of course. Since it was a family farm, Id also drink fresh raw eggs and it was delightful. All meats were well, from the farm and veggies.

nutrition,"Technically a hot dog is actually a great source of protein, but ok. I don’t even eat them, but I’d prefer it if you’d make correct nutritional statements. They’re full of protein and several micronutrients mammal meat and organs tend to be full of. Not even close to cardboard. They also are often full of cartilaginous tissue, which is fantastic for you.

nutrition,"The base aerobic system can burn either fat or glucose in the mitochondria of the muscle cells. The fat and glucose systems are separate, so it's possible to be a good glucose burner and a poor fat burner. 

The mitochondria are limited in how much energy that can provide - very roughly if you are conversational (you can talk to people fairly easily) you are likely relying on the base aerobic system. 

If you work harder that that, you start using the lactate system (sometime called anaerobic, which is honestly a bad name for it). The first step of burning glucose (glycolysis) is done, and the pyruvate that it generates is converted to lactate, which is shipped out of the muscle cells to other muscles or other tissues that can finish the process, or to the liver to be converted back to glucose. It's a biochemical hack that allows us to get more power than the mitochondria can supply.

If you are doing HIIT, you are in the lactate range. That not only means you are getting less energy from your base aerobic system, all the additional energy is coming from burning glucose.

So HIIT isn't great from a fat-burning perspective, though to be fair even low-level exercise isn't great at burning fat if you have a lot of glucose around, as that will be burned preferentially.

HIIT isn't great from a training perspective because it induces a lot of chronic fatigue, which makes you tired, which means you can't work hard enough to get the real benefits of interval training. Chronic stress isn't great from a metabolic perspective anyway. 

This is why most structured endurance training systems have a lot of low intensity volume - to train the base aerobic system - and small amounts of higher-intensity work to target the lactate system in specific ways. 

In between intensities - which is what you get if you do HIIT often - does not work well."

You can add basically whatever you want, I personally like cocoa, raspberries, cherries and then banana on top, but you´re really free to do whatever.

Saturated fats increase serum cholesterol - which is why they explicitly do not recommend saturated fat. The only recommended “meats” under Protein (pg 12) are “lean meats.” Think about it - what makes a meat lean? We call meats lean when they are low in saturated fat. It’s right there - eat protein, but don’t eat fatty meat (ie sat fat), eat lean meat (low in fat - and consequently, sat fat).

What about explicit saturated fat? That’s specifically identified as something NOT to eat - it’s under their “limit” section (pg 13) Again, think about it - why do we limit something? Because of worry of deleterious health impacts. 

So, your reading between the lines is correct - lower your cholesterol/saturated fat intake as much as possible. What does this practically mean? Limit saturated fat and cholesterol in the diet as much as possible."

That quote comes from the section on saturated fat, so cholesterol is being talked about from the perspective of saturated fat intake. On the very next page, they have an infographic showing average dietary intake of saturated fats by food groupings. The top 3 are:

1. Sandwiches (19%)
1. Deserts &amp; Sweet Snacks (11%)
1. Rice, Pasta &amp; Other Grain-Based Mixed Dishes (7%)

With the lowest sources being:

1. Eggs (3%)
1. Spreads (3%)
1. Meats, Excluding Deli &amp; Mixed Dishes (3%)
1. Starchy Vegetables (3%)

The one thing I notice about the top group is that it's predominantly processed and/or refined carbohydrates.

nutrition,"The intensity of HIIT requires more calories to be burnt im the short term than steady state cardio(like jogging).

It's also Anaerobic, which means energy is produced without oxygen. This is important because afterwards the body kicks off a process called EPOC (Excess Post exercise Oxygen Consumption.) Its where the body tries to make up for the lack of oxygen used during HIIT. A kind of oxygen debt. It uses oxygen to restore muscle glycogen and rebuild muscle proteins damaged during exercise. 

This process continues to burn calories after the activity. 

But....it doesn't take hours. 

It doesn't burn that many calories. 

You could easily cancel the calories burnt with a snack. 

And....overtime....the calories burnt aren't much more than if you'd just gone jogging.

nutrition,"Hello Reddit, this is my first post and hopefully not my last. I’m 18, 5’9 and 165 lbs. I was 210 lbs at one point  and dropped a lot of weight. The way I lost weight was healthy for the most part but eventually got bad so I decided to switch it up. I’ve been on this diet here for over a month now in an attempt for a body recomposition but haven’t seen any progress. I’ve been exercising around 3-4 days a week by lifting weights and ab workouts. Can someone point out possible something wrong with my diet. According to calculations, I would need to be on a 500 calorie deficit for body recomposition and that’s what I’ve attempted to do.

My diet:
2 whole wheat breads: 120 calories; 4g protein
3 eggs:200 (including oil) calories; 18g protein
Half a green pepper: 12 calories; 0.5g protein
Half an onion:20 calories; 0g protein
Greek Yogurt: 80 calories; 12g protein
Total:432 calories;34.5g protein

After Workout/MID-DAY:
1 large banana milkshake with 1 spoon of peanut butter: 366 calories; 13g protein 
1 120 g cooked skinless chicken breast (including seasoning/oil so +15): 213 calories; 35g protein
1 spoon of bbq sauce: 20 calories
1 Large Apple:  116 calories :0.6g of protein
Total:715 calories;48.6 grams protein

Dinner:
2 120 g cooked skinless chicken breasts (including seasoning/oil +15): 426 calories; 70g protein
Total:426 calories;70g protein

Remaining calories and protein is 400 calories and 11g protein which I get from the meal cooked at home

nutrition,"Is my roommate's diet unhealthy?


I want to start this post with yes, I know that what I'm about to list is unhealthy I'm more curious about short and long term effects. 

We've been friends since high school and he's always been a picky eater, I first found this out when we were about 18 or 19 and he said he'd grab food for himself and our friends and showed up with hamburgers with no toppings or condiments. From what I've seen most people grow out of being a picky eater and I suppose I had just assumed he had grown out of it as well. 

He just turned 30 in January and moved into the place I live in December, which gave me a deeper look into his actual diet. Every morning he eats Eggo waffles (no syrup or butter or anything just dry) and his dinner is usually one of the following: bag of potato chips, french fries, pop corn, bagel bites, or just some sort of fast food (chicken nuggets from McDonald's no sauce, hamburger plain from Jack In The Box are the main two I see.) Also all drinks are either Pepsi or Sprite. 

I'm not anywhere close to a nutritionist, but I can even tell that this is not a healthy way to live. When you're a child and are picky I understand that but I was wondering if anyone knows, like I asked above, does anyone have any information on what some longterm and short term effects would be?"

3. Put a bunch of ceyenne pepper in. 
4. Add a bunch of ground Himalayan sea salt.

nutrition,"Unless salmon farms are meticulous in their practices, farmed salmon can include pesticides and sea lice. Additionally the amount of chemicals needed to ""produce"" salmon is making the lochs in Scotland (a leading producer worldwide) into a toxic soup affecting the life in the waters around the farms. 

Hardly any of the salmon sold commercially is wild almost all is farmed. So is it healthy? I would suggest in its wild state it probably is very healthy but farmed salmon comes with a environmental and human health price tag.

Wild salmon have a very different life than farmed salmon. After hatching from eggs in streams and rivers inland, they go out to sea to grow strong and then return to their place of birth upstream to lay their eggs. Its an epic journey and once they lay their eggs they die.

So most salmon in freshwater is either too young to keep or near death so not the best to eat."
nutrition,"The current concensus in nutrition is that fat is good and that low fat diet advice never worked very well at a population level

https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-weight/healthy-dietary-styles/

&gt;Low-fat fails: While low-fat was once the diet du jour, subsequent research has shown that low-fat diets are ineffective, and moreover, that eating healthy fats is beneficial for health.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7551440/

&gt;The “fear of fat” began in the 1950s, with the emergence of evidence linking saturated fat with greater risk for cardiovascular disease [6]. As a result, low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets were recommended in the 1970s and onwards for weight loss and reducing cardiovascular disease risk. A public desire to avoid fat drove food industry reformulation of food products by food manufacturers and culinary menus marketing dishes that center around reduced or low fat. This had repercussions, as fat was most often replaced by refined carbohydrates and added sugars [7]. As fat consumption decreased, carbohydrate intake increased and was accompanied by significant increases in total energy and obesity rates in the United States [29,30,31]. Evidence has accumulated that supports dietary guidance more specifically focusing on the type of fat rather than total amount of fat.


However I am sympathetic to the idea that you can eat any ratio of fat:carbs and you'll be okay as long you're eating good fats and good carbs. The nutrition value is more important than the type of macro, maybe. The japanese seemed fairly healthy with their traditional low fat diet."

She is in a clinical psychology PhD program so she learned a lot of tools for that. I’m sorry I don’t know everything she did but heres few. Ensuring she has at least 1/2 a day every week that she doesn’t have anything going on and she can just relax this is the same day every week also. She takes about 30 minutes to an hour every day reading her Bible and journaling. She reminds herself that when people come to her with their problems that it is not her plate of sh*t. She can help them and be a friend but she does not have to take on the burdens for them. She set boundaries in her friendships. She plans out her class work and actual work every week so she doesn’t get behind or remember something last minute. When she gets stressed about something she steps back and takes a moment to pray and relax her mind. She does this even in a large group and nobody notices. If it gets really bad she will do different breathing exercises to calm herself. There are many different tools that you can look into and find what works for you also! 

She had done an intolerance test and had a huge list of things she couldn’t eat. Even avoiding these foods didn’t help very much.

nutrition,"&gt; Potatoes are technically a complete protein but are very low in tryptophan, methionine and histadine. Thus, to make a more evenly-balanced and complete protein, you need to combine potatoes with a food high in at least those three amino acids.

https://oureverydaylife.com/how-to-make-a-complete-protein-with-a-potato-12681075.html

&gt; Only 4 essential amino acids are likely to limit the protein quality of mixed diets consumed by humans—lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan. Potatoes exceed the recommended levels for all 4 of these essential amino acids, demonstrating that potato protein is of high quality. Compared with pasta, white rice, and whole-grain cornmeal, potatoes are the only staple food meeting the recommended lysine level. However, the sulfur-containing amino acids (methionine + cysteine) are lower in potatoes than in the other common staple foods.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3650512/

According to the first source, potatoes don't contain much tryptophan and methionine. According to the second source, ""potatoes exceed the recommended levels"" for tryptophan and methionine.

They have very little micronutrients. Their protein quality is poor. Pretty much all they have going for them is fiber which guess what?... so do veggies and fruit. 

Whole grains aren’t a health food, they are just healthier than refined grains. 

Of all the species of primates on this planet there are two that consume grasses (grains) us included in that number. Of that our digestive tract is least likely to process grain properly of any primate (proportionately we have the smallest colon, largest small intestine, and smallest large intestine of any primate)."

nutrition,Try to eat low mercury fish.
nutrition,"Some people get worried about mercury in fish, but the ratio selenium/mercury is more important: the protective effect of selenium on the toxicity of Hg2+ in mammals is due mainly to the in vivo formation of mercuric selenide (HgSe), a stable and biologically inert complex. Most fishes has more selenium the mercury. Sardines are a good option: rich in omega-3, cheap and easy to find. Corvina, herring, mackerel and lake trout are a good options with good omega-3 levels."

After competition, go back to normal."

nutrition,The issue with fats is when you consume a high amount and don't burn off the energy through exercise and physical activity. This results in the surplus energy being stored by the body as fat.
nutrition,what consequences would those be?

So that why some fitness people say to do low fat. 

One thing to note, most people are getting about 80-120 grams of fat a day. The body only needs about 30 grams of fat a day, maybe less.

You could also get fat from avocadoes/ flaxseeds/ fish. 

Very low fat diet is also very restrictive. Its hard to get below the 16 grams of saturated fat limit."
nutrition,So a general rule of thumb is that you need about 10% of your calories to come from fat at the minimum.  This helps with brain function and some other digestion stuff. So if you are on a 2000 calorie diet. You would need about 200 of your calories to come from fat which is about 22g. But if you want something generally realistic.

nutrition,"Technically digestion already begins in the mouth. You can secrete enzymes that break down food in your saliva although not a high amount. The stomach is insane acidic, anything will start breaking down in there, all foods including fruit. The hardest thing for the stomach to break down is fat which is why the liver produces bile which goes in the small intestine works as a detergent to further break down fat. But fruit definitely gets broken down in the stomach. The fiber from fruit barely gets broken down in the small intestine because the microflora live in the large intestine and they're the ones that break down fiber for you."
nutrition,"&gt;it \[fruit\] slows the digestion of that food

Can fruit and other food be eaten at the same time? I remember reading it is better to eat fruit first because it doesn't digest in the stomach but in the small intestine."

nutrition,"All those ""500 IQ enlightened meditation gurus"" (lmao) says you shouldn't eat 4 hours before bed, but minimum 2 hours.    
It has many benefits and aids digestion, but I think it's mainly because your body should focus on sleeping instead of breaking down and absorbing food.

Sleep is a crucial ""detox"", and it's the only real detox, all those smoothies and teas are just scams.    
When you fast you also get sort of a ""detox"" and other major benefits, so by not eating before bed you are improving the quality of your bodys own cleansing system.

Look in to how sleep works, you use for example spinal fluid to clean the brain of toxic build up while sleeping, and different sleep positions and sleep apnea can disrupt this.    
If you don't get good quality sleep every night you will literally have toxic shit constantly damaging your brain for every second you are awake.   
Your brain needs to be flushed out properly during the night."
nutrition,"As you have probably gathered from all these posts, what and when you eat is highly individualized depending on your caloric needs, appetite, medical conditions, and dietary goals. You don’t mention weight loss, acid reflux, or any other considerations, so keep in mind that would impact any advice I would give. A small snack, balancing a carb and protein, at least a half hour to an hour before bed is fine. I wouldn’t eat a second dinner or a pint of Hagen daz, but some toast with almond butter, fruit with cheese, half a sandwich, etc are good options to keep hunger from keeping you awake. Hope this helps!"
nutrition,"I’m not familiar with dietary/metabolism impacts of late snacking, but I’ve read and noticed that quality of sleep is significantly impacted, especially if the snacking is heavy in carbs. 

For staving off these cravings, my go to is trying to have plenty of vegetables with dinner and making sure I cook using real fats, so real butter vs margarin, opt out of things like low-fat sour cream. They may be lower in calories, but I find they’re not as satisfying, so I end up craving more and they often have more sugar to make up for the lack of flavor. I’m not saying to load up on fats, but make sure whatever fats you use in your food is real/healthy fats. 

When all else fails, drink lots of water or even make a good herbal tea if you want something that feels more substantive."

As long as you have done your research and you can get your nutrients from another source you should be fine. An example of a healthy group of people that cut out a whole food source are vegans. Vegans cut out all animal products and as long as they do their research and take supplements they can be just as healthy as anyone else.

65kg x 0.20% fat mass (I don't know make the calculation correctly) = 52kg x 2gr Proteins = 104 gr Proteins. But you probably have lower fat mass, use a Body Caliper to calculate your % fat mass.

nutrition,"&gt;I'm not sure why they are against potatoes, of all things.

I know this sounds crazy, but it's because that's what the data says. Potatoes/fries are strongly associated with harm. And the authors of those guidelines think that oils are super good for you and have never heard about lipid deteriation.

You can see their logic laid out all across the Harvard Nutrition Source website and in reviews like this. PUFAs are always great, even in oil form, always and forever with no nuance. https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/circulationaha.115.018585

I think there is enough data now to conclude that saturated fat is safe and there is no urgency for it to be limited. Butter and dairy fat seem to be neutral or even beneficial on health. Keto is interesting, it's an extreme diet that I think causes a lot of cognitive dissonance in people who were taught fat is bad for 50 years and they get a bit upset that it works so well. I don't really keep up with the data on that, nor would I try to argue that everyone should do that diet, but I recall seeing a lot of positive results.

Nutritionists are obsessed with saying that PUFAs&gt;SFAs even though it is just a failed model that does not work in real life. In reality, nuts and olive oil are great, cheese is good, and PUFAs in deepfryers are the most harmful part of the modern diet next to sugar."

nutrition,"&gt;	I figured the food we were refering to with the highest fructose ratio would be HFCS since the thread is a healthiest syrup comparison.

I’m sure that statement would be more relevant to that question, but I feel like citing that an apple has almost has almost twice the fructose:glucose ratio of HFCS drives the point more that there is more going on than just the saccharide ratios.

I haven’t gotten it to catch on yet, but I like to use the term glucose force, as it is a combination of both mass (glucose load) and velocity (speed of metabolism). Twist either dial too far and you have a toxic scenario. Do it multiple times every day for years and you have a disease.

&gt;	I was always under the impression that the required splitting by lactase did slow down absorption and reduce glycemic load.

Not only slow down, but doesn’t even exist past infancy in a sizable majority of the global population. Lactose also will spontaneously hydrolyze in water, albiet slowly, so you never have 100% of the CHO load in milk as lactose, some of it is free glucose and galactose. Pasteurization speeds this up but to variable degrees based on milk type, etc. That said, in a similar sense as the apple, there’s only about 5g of lactose per 100g of milk, so you’re going to be generally hard pressed to get a problematic glucose load from milk, and you also have to remember the large amount of fat in our only significant lactose sources (at least until they swap all the fat for sucrose). Fermented milk products are usually mostly galactose, which can be counted effectively as glucose, but again a very small amount per weight, of course again until we add 20g of sucrose to a half cup of yogurt.

In short, lactose only isn’t a problem because the amounts involved are small. If we started adding 200g of refined lactose to everyone’s daily food intake, we’d still be in trouble, although probably less since many people would just have unimaginable amounts of indigestion instead of type 2 diabetes.

&gt;	I have also read that lactose tastes the least sweet compared to fructose tasting the sweetest, so different amounts can be used to achieve the same desired level of sweetness. This would allow someone to reduce the glycemic load by choosing a sweeter tasting sugar and being able to use less of it for the same effect, no?

If you’re going to consider this much logical decision making in the population food behaviors, why not just bail on sweetness altogether?

In other words, biochemically you’re right as far as I can guess, but if we had that self control we would already just not be eating all the sugar. The problem has an inherent and inalienable psychological component."

https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/6/376"
nutrition,It will. Might be worth a look though
nutrition,"I understand that you arent trying to lose it. Just giving context in how you losing it should look like. 

You could look up a product called Soylent or buy some of those meal replacement shakes to try and drink in order to get some calories back.

There is no real set number on the correct number of poops per week. Some people only poop every second or third day while other people poop 3 times per day. You arent pooping much because you aren't eating much. Very normal."
nutrition,I don't think anyone was going to run with a monodiet bread.
nutrition,"You definitely know more about the science than me, and thank you for dropping the condescension. 

I figured the food we were refering to with the highest fructose ratio would be HFCS since the thread is a healthiest syrup comparison.

I was always under the impression that the required splitting by lactase did slow down absorption and reduce glycemic load. 

I have also read that lactose tastes the least sweet compared to fructose tasting the sweetest, so different amounts can be used to achieve the same desired level of sweetness. This would allow someone to reduce the glycemic load by choosing a sweeter tasting sugar and being able to use less of it for the same effect, no?"
nutrition,"No. I said it didn't have a complete aminoacid profile. As far as I understand it, the term ""complete"" doesn't refer to just having all essential aminoacids, it has to have them in a certain proportion as to make it easier to reach your protein goals with adequate aminoacids.

Now this might just be a semantics issue, I googled around and some places follow the definition I was taught (which is the one I gave) and some just say that  any food that has them all, regardless of proportion and quantity can be considered complete."
nutrition,"Yeah I wouldn't overthink it. Even pulverized, oats are going to be a healthier alternative to white flour, white rice, a bunch of breads, etc."
nutrition,Will do
nutrition,"My intention wasn't losing weight, I mean, I was losing weight, but at the rate you mentioned"
nutrition,"I thought about that, but I'm not fasting since I still eat liquid foods, eating anything that has calories will bump my glucose level thus breaking the fast, or am I wrong?"
nutrition,R/fasting.
nutrition,Just get B12 from plant milks and iron from broccoli or spinach.
nutrition,"Without giving actual advice, you have lost weight due to emptying your intestines and losing some water weight. The 12 pounds in the first week is relatively common on the first week of a no-food diet because 3-8 of those pounds are just the food that was being processed in your intestines.

Your weight should be dropping at about 3 pounds per week after that first big weight loss as natural fasting kicks in. If you keep losing 12 pounds per week, something is wrong or you are also running marathons while fasting."
nutrition,"Exactly Huel has more calories than Ensure as older people need less calories, so yeah guzzle that shit."
nutrition,"So basically the same as Huel, one serving is 500cal, and has the main nutrients + vitamins. 

Will do, thank you :)"
nutrition,Luckly I have some protein isolate (35g per serving)
nutrition,It's a meal replacement drink usually used by older people to get enough daily calories.
nutrition,Consider protein drinks also.  You'll need more protein to heal. Hope you get well soon.
nutrition,Ginger needs to be boiled. The tea bags with flakes of ginger aren't going to do any good.
nutrition,"Lactose, fructose, glucose, and sucrose all have different glycemic loads."
nutrition,I eat protein pancakes on training days. I eat them with grape concentrated syrup sweetened with sucralose. It’s about 30 calories for 3 tbsp which is usually about all I need. Sometimes I’ll weigh it out but other times I just eyeball it and enter 50 cal into mfp.
nutrition,"Processed carbohydrates are not a necessity but whole plant foods are a necessity for humans. Meaning if you go long enough without consuming them you will develop a list of different diseases, scurvy and constipation are usually the first symptoms."

nutrition,"Good point! I suggested that my way to do it is the best or only way, but there's more than one way to do it, and the way you suggested could even be more accurate."
nutrition,making your own nut milks is so easy. There are many videos and such. I take the nuts ( preferably cashew ) soak then blend. I often add a banana ( frozen) and some dates. YUM
nutrition,"I agree this is the case for most people, but speaking for myself, I had such a binge-eating problem that I did have to reduce the amount of fruit I was eating. The sugar in 10+ servings adds up, and it would frequently trigger overeating of other food once I got that taste for sugar - like an addict that can't stop with just one."
nutrition,"good karma unsweetened flax milk is my favorite (the regular kind, not the one w protein). i havent heard many people talk about this one so it might be an unpopular opinion idk but its great as far as taste, consistency, and nutrition go. a great way to get omega 3s in too!"
nutrition,"So that's a ""yes"" then? You find that consuming carbohydrates is biologically necessary?"
nutrition,Drink milk. It’s ok
nutrition,I think Kodiak cakes syrup is the best “healthy” syrup if I had to pick a syrup as healthy. Plus they are just bomb!! You can add it to smoothies etc. Sooo good!!!
nutrition,"The problem is that they all have to be highly processed. 

Unless you’re extremely lactose intolerant you may want to try Kalona Supernatural Organic Whole Milk https://kalonasupernatural.com/product/organic-milk-cream/organic-whole-milk/. 

It’s grass fed, non-homogenized, and still has the delicious cream on top. Good stuff"
nutrition,Alpro coconut milk. So delicious!
nutrition,"Yes I do, I have the real deal occasionally, but I like to put a healthier twist on it (whole grain/chickpea pasta instead of white, less butter, etc). I've used this as an opportunity to spice up my cooking skills and try to make my version taste as great as the original. 

I know I've done it when I've tricked my family into thinking they're being served the original version :)"
nutrition,What is the best brand in your opinion?
nutrition,Exactly my point. There are different research projects. Depends how the research is done it will yield different results. Big companies like tobacco companies have been known to pay “scientists”. There is government funding but okay. Might be different in Australia compared to where you’re from.
nutrition,"Different people want different products, but your list is not inherent (or perhaps even typical) to soy milk.

The ingredients list of the soy milk I buy for example: water, soy beans, seaweed.

(The seaweed is to fortify calcium)"
nutrition,"Yeah, this is generally why I do almond or flax instead of soy. I can knock back half a gallon of almond milk in two days and 30 calories vs 100 calories per cup makes a big difference esp when you’re short."
nutrition,Elmhurst makes nut milks without the emulsifiers. Carageenan is really rough on your guts and it flared up my IBS like crazy. Switching to Elmhurst has helped a TON. The unsweetened varieties are just nuts and water.
nutrition,"I have this too, love it."
nutrition,"If you’re looking for nutritionally and environmentally conscious choices, you’re better off making your own if you’re able. It’s easy and doesn’t require much more than a blender and a sieve.

That being said, I really like Elmhurst cashew milk. Just cashews and water (maybe salt?), and cashew milk is richer and creamier than the oat and soy milks I’ve had."
nutrition,"Try upping your protein intake, significantly. I've seen this happen, people get ""full"" only in volume but they don't get ""satiated"", so they are still willing to keep eating.

It's just a thought, it couldn't hurt."
nutrition,Soy tends to be high in calories. Unsweetened Almond milk is my go to (about 30 cals per 8 oz versus about 80 cals for the same amount of unsweetened soy milk).
nutrition,Oat milk is my new favorite coffee addition. Idk why but it tastes so much better in coffee than regular dairy. Chobani makes a zero sugar version.
nutrition,"No milk is going to be really healthy. Think of it like juice. Fruit juice is far less healthy than the fruit. &lt;Anything&gt; milk is less healthy than &lt;anything&gt;.  Don't make any milk a staple of. your diet. Don't drink much of it and you're fine.

I use Silk unsweetened soy milk. Look for anything without added sugar nor added oil. The fewer the ingredients the better. Under those guidelines, any source is fine. Oat, almond, soy, cashew, coconut, whatever you want.

No added sugar, no added oil, and use sparingly."
nutrition,Canned coconut milk is a great sub from cream in soups. It does bring a coconut flavor to the dish so you have to be aware of that.  I am not aware of how “healthy” it is but I’m lactose intolerant so it’s what works for me.
nutrition,"If you called it ""soy juice"" would that make it Moore real? Should we be saying ""cow juice"""
nutrition,"What's unhealthy about gellan gum? 

Also as an option, Kirkland unsweetened soy milk: organic soybeans, water"
nutrition,"I tried hemp milk when I learned how much water is used is growing almonds and was so surprised how pleasant hemp milk is, the seeds are a very mild, sweet flavor too. I use them to make cereal and granola."
nutrition,"I like Malk Oat Milk. It's organic oats, water and salt. Just like I'd make it at home without the slime."
nutrition,"I got an almond cow for Christmas and love it. I use it 1-2x a week, takes maybe 5min total and feel good knowing exactly what’s in my nut milks. *disclaimer, the milk it makes is more watery then store bought stuff because it doesn’t have all the added thickeners etc"
nutrition,"Nothing upsets my stomach liked cooked tomatoes. Definitely not the same as raw for me. I thought maybe it was because they are nightshades, but I think it has more do with acidity."
nutrition,"Spinach. I don't know about fruit, not a fruit guy."
nutrition,"Except as soon as you stick a thermometer in, you’ve basically ruined the steak. Learn to judge doneness by feel, like the chefs do and you won’t lost a drop of juice or flavour."
nutrition,"Oatmilk macros aren't as comparable to actual milk.

Oatmilk is mostly carbs with only 1g protien per serving. Whereas soy milk at least gives you 7g of protien per serving."
nutrition,"This depends on which direction your pH is. If you aren't having any issues you don't need to eat anything specific.

General recommendations are usually not eating big meals, not fasting for too long, and not consuming general irritants like spices, fried food, and carbonated beverages. But this is generally for people with acid reflux."
nutrition,Uhh. And keep getting it pregnant so you can get milk? Cows don’t just make milk spontaneously....
nutrition,"For people like me who are anaemic, we have to eat lots and lots of red meat. I think it depends on individual requirements."
nutrition,Even the original flavour! I make my lattes with them and it comes out so frothy!
nutrition,"How is swallowing a pill more work than cooking spinach? Anyway, eat spinach with some sort of fat for best absorption of what spinach can offer you. Cook it."
nutrition,I used to add applesauce to my oatmeal to sweeten it up.
nutrition,"So, protein bars don't usually give proper nutrition, most of them are just sugar with protein. If you need protein on the go, get a protein shake.

As far as nutrient dense meals you can't go wrong with eggs and dark leafy greens for the most part.

Unfortunately most nutrient dense food isn't readily made for snacking, or for packaging. The closest I can think of here is fruit."
nutrition,"Depending on what you want to use the milk for (taste, to moisten cereal, cookies, etc.), you might look into making your own. I make a blend of almond/coconut milk at home. It’s FAR cheaper, and there is NOTHING in it but what I put myself (vanilla flavor, sugar or honey, etc). It’s easy and quick after soaking."
nutrition,"Maybe it's just me but for me personally I have realized that fruits trigger cravings and sometimes I cannot stop eating once I have started.
For example, I would easily eat 2 apples, 2~3 bananas, 12 strawberries, some frozen mango and pinrapple after (!) lunch or dinner.
Omg, and roastedsweet potatoes, I could eat tons of them any team even if I am really full already.
The portion of the lunch/dinner is normal and I feel full but somehow i crave something sweet and once I start I have a really hard time stopping (and almonds, super addicted to them).

I am not a dietitian but just by the portion size I am pretty sure that I am overshooting on calories.

Oh and I usually eat WFPB. I think it's really weird and I feel like I dont have a healthy relationship to food despite eating (mostly) WFPB."
nutrition,"Unless you're diabetic or specifically trying to get into ketosis, I wouldn't sweat it. This is assuming you mean whole fruits, not juices; also dried fruit is probably not a good idea, easy to overeat them."
nutrition,"When you blend and drink a fruit, your body absorbs the sugar more quickly than it would if you ate it whole. This causes a greater spike in insulin and thus synthesizes more body fat. In the end you are still getting the fiber etc, but it does make somewhat of a difference."
nutrition,"I like WestSoy.  It’s not in the refrigerator section.  Soybeans &amp; water, that’s it (in the unsweetened version, which is what I buy).  9g protein per cup.  Available at our Walmart here."
nutrition,Is that good or bad? Do you want 100% almonds in your almond **milk**?
nutrition,Well that just markets itself
nutrition,"I think there are close to no health benefits in bagged tea, just buy cheap Chinese tea in teashops online or your local ones"
nutrition,Your body absorbs the nutrients more quickly in smoothie than in the whole food due to the cell walls. Blending breaks down cell walls and thylakoids to some extent and make absorption easier. This can mean more nutrients absorbed but also quicker absorption higher in the intestine starving our bacteria that live in the colon
nutrition,They are the food for our gut bacteria. If you completely avoid them much of your gut bacteria will die off and you gut flora will be less diverse. I did the fodmap for a time when I had IBS but it’s not a very effective diet and when I stopped fodmap and switched to a whole food plant based diet my stomach began to heal much quicker.
nutrition,Yes but when eating a whole fruit it will break down slower than drinking a smoothie. If Ineat blueberries while they might make it all the way to my colon and feed my gut bacteria the whole way down. If I blend those berries up they’re absorbed higher up in the stomach.
nutrition,"Well carbohydrates is a bit of a reductionist term. Usually whole plant foods are comprised of many different nutrients. Carbohydrates, fiber, phytonutrients only found in plants, antioxidants, etc. 

Humans do have a need to consume whole plant foods. Our brains require glucose to function, we store extra glucose in our muscles. When people are on the keto diet their brains often borrow glucose from their muscles. When athletes prepare for a long race they often carb load for energy. So yes we do need carbohydrates but we also need all of the other compounds, nutrients, components of plants too.

1 banana,  
Quarter scoop whey, 
1.5 cup coffee(room temperature - espresso + water)

My goals are fat loss and increasing strength.

Please comment your opinions and recommendations"
nutrition,"Book answer is around 100g protein for you since you're weightlifting, and \~500 caloric deficit to cut.

With that said 1400 calories is already on the low end of things and you say you're stuck.  I am reluctant to tell you to reduce your calorie intake even further so I'm going to ask you a few questions--fingers crossed that you're doing something wrong and it's an easy fix.

Can you list down your diet?  How long have you been stuck at your current weight?

Are you weightlifting properly for your goals?  Progressive overload on compound movements with a focus on lower body exercises?  Deadlifts, squats, lunges, etc.  Your goal of building/maintaining muscle while losing fat is not easy.  You can't half-ass it at the gym, you have to go hard.

If you are able to, increasing cardio does help.  Burns more calories and gives your diet more leeway.  Are you currently walking on a treadmill?"
nutrition,"In most cases, yes you can."
nutrition,"Does it sub for milk though?

I buy it sometimes because I don't like milk really. I use it with protein.

But can you sub milk in cooking with this?"
nutrition,"I am not sure many would drink that. I have no problem with it, but I am weird like that."
nutrition,There’s a label on the back

Large scale funding of scientific studies that are dubious can only achieved by very rich companies or industries, I can’t think of any which would fall in that category that would stand to gain from cows being harmful to the environment? I can think of industries that fit in that category that would benefit from the opposite though (dairy and beef)."
nutrition,"I used to deprive myself of the things I’d enjoy and I didn’t actually start losing weight until I worked those into my diet. Lucky charms included, being 1 cup of it, not a whole ass bowl lol"
nutrition,"Whole grains, veggies (try mostly low to moderate oxalate however parsley is fine cause it's eaten in small amounts), have a beta carotene source daily whether it's sweet potato, carrot or some other orange plant food. make sure to include onions or garlic with every meal possible as they significantly boost mineral absorption, ginger and capsaicin have been shown to boost mineral absorption as well.


get a pressure cooker (I don't have one yet) as it can be extremely useful.

You wanna eat a lot of beans too, lentils are probably the best, my favorite now are black lentils, chickpeas are great too, so are black beans too.

Tofu is great and a lot of wonderful recipes can be made with it.

Eat hulled sesame seeds and find a good brand of hulled sesame tahini (maybe see middle eastern stores).

Eat at least a tbsp of ground flaxseeds daily, or you could cook the flaxseeds whole, i think that would make them digestible. You can also eat chia seeds and hempseeds as well, great source of ala.

Don't eat high omega 6 oils, extra virgin olive oil is fine, preferably in it's raw state of course as opposed to cooking it but if you gotta cook with oil used a little of it, or you can roast in the oven.

Make sure to eat a fat source with fat soluble vitamins, a, k, e and i forgot the other one lol

Vitamin c increases non heme iron absorption.

teas can inhibit mineral absorption in food and it's best you not drink tea with your meals.

If you like pumpkin seeds then great, they're an excellent source of nutrition and several minerals, make sure to roast them a little tho.


Increase fiber consumption gradually, and eat meals you enjoy, find what works for you, make sure to take b12 and if you don't go out in the sun take vitamin d3.

Also apart from veggies and other whole plant food sources of calcium you can include fortified plant milk, i prefer soy.

Learn convenient easy nutrition and tasty meals.

You can run into problems as a vegan, just the same as it is for non vegans, some expect perfection after going vegan or mostly plant based, it's unrealistic, whatever problems you run into you try to fix by doing research or getting help."
nutrition,"I’ve been using Ripple “Unsweetened” milk and love it.  It’s sugar free, 80 calories for 8oz, 8GB of protein. It’s also easy to find at places like Target so you don’t necessarily have to hit up more specialty grocers like a Sprouts or Whole Foods:

https://www.ripplefoods.com/original-unsweetened-plant-milk/"
nutrition,"Came here to also advocate for soy milk. Soy milk may not be trendy, but it has the best amino acid profile and amount of protein of all the milk alternatives. It is super versatile in cooking and baking, and has a reasonable fat and carbohydrate content to help with nutrient absorption (and creaminess and mouthfeel).

Is it also more sustainable to produce than all of the nut milks, and doesn’t need a ton of additives to taste good (I’m looking at you, Oatly). Yes, most soy milks have something added, but you can select the ones with only nutrient fortification, which is a good thing!"
nutrition,"I fast from \~9:00 PM to \~6:00 PM almost every day unless I do significant physical activity in the morning. Usually I workout 5-6 and eat immediately after. I do not have any of the poor side effects some have noted. Everyone is different, though.   


As an aside, I do not sit down and eat 1500-2000cal all at once. I eat a reasonable meal and then snack for a couple hours. I do not have problems getting enough protein, I am not a vegan so every meal contains meat, eggs, or protein heavy vegetables like beans followed by a protein supplement. I cannot eat dairy, so my protein supplement is plant based. I also do not have a problem getting sufficient fiber, my meals always have a hefty serving of vegetables. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I feel it gives me more mental acuity throughout the day because I do not ride a hunger pang roller coaster. I am more efficient at work, I do not stop and distract myself to eat. When I want to cut calories it is a little easier, because I am full whether I eat 1500 or 2500. It trains me to drink more water, because while true hunger pangs do not happen my stomach will feel a bit empty...in goes more water.   


To me, I feel as if this is how our bodies evolved: fast then feast. Fundamentally we are still hunger-gatherers. Ag only developed \~6,000 years ago.  No, I am not paleo or whatever (just generally well balanced and healthy)...but once I broke the cycle of eating 3+ periods throughout the day it became easy. When I break my new normal of eating once a day (say vacation or whatever) it only takes a day or two to get right back to eating once a day comfortably."
nutrition,"When you say it depends what scientists you speak to that just depends on if you speak to reputable scientists or not. I think it’s a big problem in our society that people seek out a scientist to back up their view point rather than look at the scientific pear reviewed consensus. Scientific consensus is the collective judgment, position, and opinion of the community of scientists in a particular field of study. Although consensus does not mean every scientist agrees (hence why you can find one that doesn’t) it is the general agreement which is what we should trust. What You or I would like to be true has no bearing on what is true."
nutrition,"There's no mk4 in plant food, your body does make it however, but of course dietary mk4 can have benefits, however eating animal foods to get those benefits is counterproductive as animal foods come with a lot of downsides in terms of health (let alone environmental and ethical concerns).


To me it doesn't make sense to do that especially when if you really want mk4 you can just buy an mk4 supplement (many vegans one) and they're effective and come in much higher doses than found in food, so more effective even"
nutrition,I like my almond milk with extra pulp
nutrition,"I honestly hate being that guy, but is there another name for these kinds of drinks?

I realize that milk is a term used for other non-mammal-gland secretions, among other things  in construction.

I also realize that consumers have no chance for confusion here.

But just curious if there exist other names, or have they been tried in the market?

E.g., plant based meat I see an uptick in people using the term ""plant based protein""."

Stevia is pretty awful for baking, it's inconsistent in sweetness (varies by brand, good luck trying to adjust every one of your recipes) and has a bad aftertaste in my opinion (though it's not bad in a drink). Swerve is as close as you can get to a 1 to 1 sugar replacement in terms of sweetness.

I've vaguely read that raw honey has a lower glycemic index but obviously baking would nullify its properties. Though it may still have a lower glycemic index, I would rather stick with Swerve and have raw honey with bread and butter."

* What a blessing. Especially on a cut. I focus on important shit during the day, in a focused, fasted state. 

* Metabolism way better. Body focused on digesting, then moves to a intermitten fasting state, instead of always having something shoved down the esophagus. 

* Felt way healthier for 22h of the day. More alert, focused, energetic. 

* The 2 hours of eating can be burdensome if you require a lot of calories, but if you cook the right foods it is way easier than people think. (On a cut i'd throw in a couple avocados, some easy dense carbs like rice, my protein, and some veg and its easily 2k. 

* Workouts before dinner were okay. I did not have as much energy and glycogen as on a bulk, but on a cut i still maintained my workout regiment. 

* There is no necessity to even think or worry about food for 22 hours in your day. I used to go to work and not worry about packing or buying lunch

* Super convenient too. I cooked at dinner, after my workout, and ate a bunch of food. 

* Definitely NOT recommended for everyone. Consider your individual circumstances."
nutrition,"There is fish oil with out high amounts of Vitamin A. I personally like OmegaVia fish oil which is sources from small fish like sardines. To my understanding, small fish contain less vitamin A because they're not as high in the food chain (inversely, polar bear liver has insane amounts of vitamin A). It doesn't say what the vitamin A content is on the bottle, but when looking up the nutrition data of canned sardines, the vitamin A content is quite low. Cod liver oil on the other hand is very high in vitamin A (I'm not sure about salmon)."

nutrition,"Wierd answer, but if you get chocolate-flavoured PB2 (or any other powdered peanut butter) and shank the water ratio a bit so it's you get a delicious low calorie pancake topper.  Only 3g sugar."
nutrition,"If you have access to fresh elderberries, you can simmer them with water until reduced and stir in local, raw honey to make elderberry syrup. Delicious on pancakes and it's loaded with immune boosting constituents."
nutrition,"Why are you so defensive, exactly? Sugar is sugar so just use whatever sweetener you like best. Arguing that maple sugar has omega 6 is a joke."
nutrition,"Yeah but broccoli tastes terrible on pancakes.  Sometimes you've gotta live, for crissakes."
nutrition,The question is what is the healthiest syrup. Not what is the healthiest foods lol
nutrition,"Totally goes day to day for me.

Sometimes I’ll go an entire week only eating once per day. But I virtually always intermittently fast in one way or another. It simply works to well and conveniently to manage the amount of calories I eat."
nutrition,i pretty much do that same when it comes to fruit or veggies! good to hear im not totally wasting my time
nutrition,"I pay zero attention to it. Lost 50 lbs 5-6 years ago, now maintain at 12% body fat, still eat an apple before each meal, and a banana before every workout which is 7 days a week for me. Also frozen strawberries and blueberries with Greek yogurt for breakfast basically every day, and sometimes lunch too. So a ton of fruit. Never even think about it."
nutrition,"I would not recommend this. Especially if you’ve suffered from disordered eating (which I think I saw you say). Unfortunately the best way “diet” is no diet. Eating a wide range of different foods that supply all the macro and micronutrients you need. If intuitive eating is hard maybe consider setting meal times aiming for three larger meals and snacks between. I know no one likes hearing It but all these crazy diets (IF, keto etc) are just FAD diets and are unrealistic and not as beneficial as everyone thinks."
nutrition,Nope just strawberries in a pot. They have enough liquid once thawed that you don’t need to add extra.
nutrition,"My mistake. I thought this sub was for discussions of nutrition, not useless pedantry."
nutrition,They're not saying maple syrup is healthy. They're saying they're healthier than other syrups. That difference is tiny but it's still there.
nutrition,"Very interesting! I absolutely agree with the ""binge"" mindset being unhealthy for me too. I'm feeling way better eating 3 meals a day, it feels a lot more like a healthy lifestyle. 

What kind of OMAD meals did you have? Mine involved a lot of veggies and legumes so I wonder if that contributed to my bloating and discomfort due to the large fiber intake."
nutrition,"I'm sure a single piece of broccoli has vastly more of the aforementioned nutrients than maple syrup.    
    
Sugar is sugar. If you're opting to consume sugar then just add it to healthy foods to make them easier to consume, ""sugar makes the medicine go down""."
nutrition,"How does fiber impact bloodsugar? Carbohydrates aren’t really destroyed during blending, and that’s what effects bloodsugar (depending on how much protein and fat you’re eating with those carbs)"
nutrition,"Honey or natural maple syrup are going to be your best bet. Maple syrup has a slightly lower glycemic index (lower the better meaning that your body absorbs the sugar slower, having less of a strain on your pancreas secreting insulin) than honey (54 vs. 58, whereas pure sugar sits at 65), but honey has more nutrients, vitamins, and antioxidants than pure maple syrup does. Definitely avoid the processed fake syrups!"
nutrition,"Meh: fasting doesn't have a difference physically over standard caloric restrictions, per these studies.   


The mental impact can be huge, though. If it's what works for someone, go for it!"
nutrition,Yes that’s pretty much what it means
nutrition,"That’s funny because almost all of these were opposite for me in OMAD. The reason I don’t do it anymore is more of a mental aspect of it which is that my relationship to food changed, and I thought of my one meal I ate as a binge. It was still within the calories and macros I wanted to hit for the day, but the way I treated it and the reason I implemented it was so that I could have the “joy” of binging on a lot of food at once. 

I want to have a long term sustainable and healthy relationship with food so I do more 18/6 and 20/4 now.  

I guess my stomach is comfortable with a lot of food so I never had a problem with bloating or discomfort 

After OMAD for a few weeks was the one time where I can say I literally had ZERO hunger throughout the day until after my evening fasted workout.

I ate exactly what I would throughout a day just in one meal, around 2200 calories at the time. 

BMs were extremely predictable, almost exactly after my meal every evening.

Workouts were energetic and I felt decent with lifts for cutting weight.


I guess everyone is just different!"
nutrition,I would do OMAD only as a part of a ketogenic diet. If you are in a stable ketosis it is mostly ok not to eat anything during the day.
nutrition,"When you say brought to a boil, does this mean you add some amount of water to the strawberries? This sounds good, I’m wondering how you do it"
nutrition,"You can be sensitive towards it and could cause some minor issues with the gut, but you do not need to avoid if. The O in FODMAP is Oligosacharides and is used to determine what type of food is casusing your gut issues."
nutrition,lmao it’s always people with crazy unhealthy diets making these bs “sugar is sugar” statements
nutrition,salad and beans
nutrition,"Green tea/Coffee, oatmeal/dried fruit and nuts muesli, yogurt/vegan milk, and a fruit, I cycle between two or three. These days, I’m enjoying passion fruit that my mom sent me."
nutrition,No thank you
nutrition,"By ""mental health food"" do you just mean... things you enjoy?"
nutrition,"Currently 36 weeks pregnant and my go to is a smoothie with three medjool dates, banana, tsp peanut butter, tsp of flax seed and a scoop of chocolate protein powder blended up with some ice cubes &amp; water. I'll grab a power bar if I'm feeling hungrier but that holds me till first lunch lol"
nutrition,I use a sugar free version. It tastes fine and is almost calorie free. Walden Farms pancake syrup
nutrition,mental health food?? ...lucky charms??
nutrition,"Damn man, it's water with bubbles added to it. Wtf could it do to you? Make you burp? Oh no! Why even ask a question like this? For you op, it will kill you because you asked this question"
nutrition,"Today I had toasted crumpets, marmite spread on top, crunchy peanut butter on top of that and sliced bananas to top it off. Don’t knock it till you try it!"
nutrition,"black coffee, 4 eggs with broccoli and green beans and maybe a piece of fruit

if I feel like I won't be home until late I'll have my dinner chicken breast for breakfast instead, my diet is very protein focused and I'm eating at a deficit currently"
nutrition,"* Matcha latte (soy milk + maple syrup + matcha)
* Pasture-raised eggs, scrambled
* Granny Smith apple

The combination of protein + fat + fiber keeps full for hours even after an intense workout."
nutrition,Carrots and jalapenos.
nutrition,"Anecdotal, but I have had lots of success with this in terms of energy management and my body shape. I do snack on sugary fruits and vegetables though. And my one meal was very calorie dense, biased towards proteins and fats (although not totally carb free).

&gt;OMAD

One gallon of Milk A Day. Now *that* was a shitshow."
nutrition,"Extremely active teen trying to gain weight here... my breakfast is a bit of a doozy. 
-One whole grain bagel 
-Four eggs
-Four slices Canadian bacon
-Two slices of low fat cheese
-banana protein smoothie made of protein powder, a banana, natural peanut butter, and almond milk. 
When you’ve got to eat 4800 locals a day, you gotta start it off strong 😂"
nutrition,I could definitely see it impacting fitness goals but not really weight loss by itself. I usually do OMAD when I want to lose weight because I find it easier to stick to a deficit when I have such a strict window and that one massive meal usually fulfills the urge to eat until I'm stuffed.
nutrition,"Whole wheat toast with goat cheese or cream cheese. With sardines, shaved red onion, jalapeno, capers and a sprinkle of dill/pepper and a drizzle of olive oil."
nutrition,"Got it. Carrot slices cooked in olive oil are unhealthy because “tOo mUcH fAt!”, and maple syrup (which is virtually sugar syrup) is healthy, because minerals.

God help anyone who follows your suggestions."
nutrition,You're welcome :-D
nutrition,Sorghum syrup is another option too. I’ll have one or the other on toast once in awhile. So good.
nutrition,Why are you having lemon water with salt in it?
nutrition,"My friend had great results with OMAD. I’ve lost 50 pounds on a modified OMAD. I’ll have a couple of healthy snacks during the day in order to keep myself from getting so hungry I make bad decisions but I try to only eat one complete ‘meal’. So I guess I really do a 20:4 or a 21:3 fast. Some days I do eat meals throughout the day, just depends on what I have going on. 

All my blood work and health statistics are great and much improved. My doctor has said he feels comfortable with what I’m doing so I have no concerns. My BP is down, bad cholesterol is down, blood sugar is good, fatty liver intrusion is improving etc. 

I’ve been doing this for over a year and I’m used to it now. I just had a yogurt with granola about two hours ago and while I could eat I’m not ‘hungry’. I’ll probably eat an orange in an hour and then dinner later this evening. Ive also had no problems going to the gym or doing yard work etc while eating this way."
nutrition,"Love having a green smoothie with cucumber, pineapple, baby spinach, green apple, 4 oz of OJ &amp; water! Then I have a carrot and a piece of sourdough toast with butter. Lots of water and a black cold brew too!"
nutrition,"I’m supposed to use a pallet jack but I just go back to my childhood football days and push the boxes, usually I move up to 1800 pounds a day... followed by shovelling the contents of the box into a machine. I try to think creatively, I still workout 2x a day but it’s a light workout, light as in heavy weights low reps. I get carpal tunnel if I don’t lift weights and bike at home to keep everything fluid"
nutrition,"Try fasting like Muslims, ramadan pretty much the same but gives you more time to eat."
nutrition,"4eggs and toast with a ""shake"" of blended spinach and carrots for micro nutrients and fiber"
nutrition,I’d argue that lucky charms would make a mans mental health worse
nutrition,"Can share my experience doing omad and trying to lose weight at the same time for a couple of months

I was loosing 200g each day through Monday till Friday (1kg total) and gaining it back on Saturday and Sunday on which I ate my regular three meals a day

So I failed to lose weight and I can’t say that I felt any better than doing three meals a day

Again, this is just my experience and it may not correlate with other’s or your experience or with any scientific data that one may find"
nutrition,Also take into account that the bioavailability of these vitamins is much lower in supplements than it is in food so even though there’s a high dose your body won’t necessarily use it/absorb it all
nutrition,"Oatmeal with some milled flax, chia seeds, a little honey and a handful of blueberries mixed in.  Same thing every day, it fills me up and makes me feel good. And a cup of black coffee."
nutrition,"The only thing I drink besides water throughout the day is black coffee in the morning. My breakfast right now is two egg and ground turkey burritos with salsa and avocado, and a bowl of strawberries and blueberries"
nutrition,That's the goal of lovely capitalism
nutrition,"Yes, that is what it means."
nutrition,"The question is about the ""healthiest syrups"". Maple syrup is healthier than corn syrup because it actually has some nutritional value. Stay on topic buddy. That seems to be very hard for you to do."
nutrition,"So just to be clear, I'm supposed to be surprised when a person eats the same amount of calories in 1 meal that they did in 3 and maintains their weight without caloric restriction?

Look at my last comment by the way.  I said nothing about larger meals slowing down your metabolism, I said it slowed down your digestion.  There's a huge difference between those 2 things. 

Obviously 1 large meal will store more fat temporarily than 3 meals spaced out throughout the day.  The important thing is net fat storage or oxidation at the end of the 24 hour period when comparing the 2.  The human body is MUCH better at adapting to different meal size and frequency then you're giving it credit for..."
nutrition,"Ohh damm, you are correct. I checked."
nutrition,"Try doing OMAD once a week, and just eat a normal dinner +snack maybe.   It'd be a real nice easy fast, and would be helpful."
nutrition,"Usually skipped, but eggs and avocado otherwise"
nutrition,Black coffee. I don't eat till evening usually.
nutrition,Bacon eggs green beans.   Tea with coconut milk
nutrition,None.
nutrition,"No, I’m here to tell armchair scientists that the factoid nonsense they’re spreading is, in fact, factoid nonsense."
nutrition,Gotcha.  I've been focusing on a percentage this whole time but will start focusing on grams instead.  Thanks for the info.
nutrition,"You are, or you are *not*?"
nutrition,"I'm doing a paper on this so I must ask-aren't the omega 3 in seed oils mostly ALA? I found that algae oil is the closest to fish oils in its omega 3 composition. Do correct me if I'm wrong, you can never know everything"
nutrition,"OMAD still includes snacks, usually OMAD is a strict variation of intermittent fasting. So instead of a 6-8 hour eating window with 2 primary meals, you have a 2-4 hour window with one primary meal and maybe a large snack.

Personally I prefer having a window from 11am to 6pm. It works for me because I don't usually eat a breakfast anyways, and this keeps me from having a large late dinner as well as eliminating evening snacking including alcohol."
nutrition,Aren’t the ones in a can technically soaked?
nutrition,"I do eat it sometimes, but I get very sensitive on my mouth afterwards and it can hurt a lot. And even if that didn't happen, sometimes drinking is just a different experience of getting your food."
nutrition,"Agreed! If you want to support organic produce, by all means go for it... but please don't think its automatically healthy. And half the time companies have non-organic things in them anyway."
nutrition,Because it is?
nutrition,"I don’t eat meat, but even when I was an omnivore back in the day, I was regularly iron and b12 deficiency anemic. I have an underlying health condition that causes it, diet is not a factor; bleeding is lol"
nutrition,"I work in retail and i can do 20 000 steps on a busy day with very little to 0 time in in at the cash register. I carry stuff and move pallets all day long. Youd think i loose weight super easy?

I had it easier to lose weight when i was uneomployed or studied. So much easier to control my urges as i had more time to commit to eating. I could also eat whenever i want and i wasnt hungry all the damn time. So i only ate when i was supposed to do.

My schedule can look like like this.

Alarm starts at 05:10. In the next 30 minutes i eat breakfast and get myself ready and go to work. I work reall hard and i get 30 minute break at around 9. Sometmes 930. Then i get off at usually 13 or 1400. Always very hungry and im in a hurry to get home due to having a child. 

Dinner at 16 - 17 usually. 

That ""lunch"" at 9 fucks my entire day up. No excuse but my job makes it harder to loose weigh for sur."
nutrition,Why not just eat the orange? You get rid of all the fibers if you squeeze out all the flesh and youre left with only liquid sugars.
nutrition,Chicken breast instead of red meat
nutrition,"Oh yeah. Plenty of people just open a can of beans, rinse them quickly, then eat."
nutrition,"No, you are absolutely right. Beans can really get you if you process them incorrectly before consumption. There's a reason traditional Southern food involves soaking beans overnight and then baking them low and slow all day."
nutrition,"Okay, that one made me chuckle."
nutrition,"MARGARINE.

WHY IS THIS STILL PUSHED AS HEALTHY."
nutrition,I didn't know there are people who don't soak them
nutrition,I was just wondering
nutrition,Yeah but those people who are out of shape at your work might be in better condition then if they worked in a sedentary job
nutrition,"I may get some disagreement with this but.. *unsoaked* beans and legumes.

90% of people cannot fully digest them. They contain lectins. Anti nutrients. Can be very tough on those with Inflamation in body and/or autoimmune diseases. Plus they are not vital to nutrition in any way.

Unless you *really* enjoy beans/legumes, I would say avoid them. Or at very least, soak them before eating (which most people do not do)"

nutrition,Looove ghee especially the brand 4th and Heart
nutrition,"That’s not what I said. I said they’re not healthy, as many people think, which is what the question asked 🙂"
nutrition,Job type is a huge influence if you manage every other factor properly. Also lets get our definitions straight. 10k steps isn't an active job. 24k+ is an active job. A few problems with this job type though-- managing hunger becomes very challenging with this job type. You can lose too much weight too fast if you aren't careful. Great for losing weight but difficult once you need to gain again.
nutrition,Asian pears and brussel sprouts.
nutrition,Factory farmed meats. I try and only eat organic grass fed. It changes the nutrition drastically!
nutrition,"My theory is that people with active jobs subconsciously eat more calories to “make up for” the movement. Our brains prompt us to do weird stuff like that.

It’s the only way I can explain overweight people who work on their feet all day, and there are a lot."
nutrition,"Yes the water-based ones do work well. But you'll need to consume with fat to absorb the fat based ones. FYI, vitamins are probably cheaper"

nutrition,"So what? Kept in a cool, dry space, lots of foods will stay good for extended periods of time — apples, onions, potatoes to name a few. 

What makes you not trust them?"
nutrition,rice cakes with greek yogurt and strawberries
nutrition,"The problem with threads like this is people's often quite loose definition of words like ""healthy"" and ""unhealthy"". 

Fats, sodium, sugar, etc... Outside of things like transfats, which you shouldn't have at all... Most of these things are not inherently unhealthy, in fact you need them. You just shouldn't have them in excess. 

So stuff like yoghurts and fruit juice... If you're getting the stuff without added sugar, they're not inherently unhealthy. They're unhealthy if you're already consuming too much of the stuff in general. Greek/low fat yoghurt with no added sugar and fruit-only juice? Pretty healthy if you consume them in an healthy diet and in moderation.

With that in mind, let's get the most obvious and generic out of the way: Most pre-made food you buy in shops will have a higher than desired amount of sodium, fats, sugar, or some combination of the above, as most people are fairly ignorant regarding labeling and nutrition (and in some places correct labeling isn't even enforced) and these things make food more palatable, particularly relevant when food is done with economic priority instead of taste - such as cheaper ingredients. Even the most underwhelming salad can taste at least passably with an (un)healthy dose of salt and fatty dressing! So if you're planning to eat outside, read your labels before assuming something is good, and budget your nutrition in mind that you'll most likely be consuming a higher fat/sugar/sodium meal than usual.

Additionally: highly processed meat, such as most pre-packaged ground beef and burgers, is linked to higher chance of colon cancer. This does not include freshly ground beef, as its mostly related to the presence of conservatives such as nitrites, but over-consumption of \*red\* meat does seem to increase chances of cancer as well. 

This does not mean that you should never have a cheeseburger or can ever buy cheap ground beef, just that you should try to limit to a couple servings a week or less if possible. Moderation!

In that same note, most BIG fish, like Tuna, can lead to mercury poisoning. Basically small fish build up mercury in their body. Bigger fish eat smaller fish, build up THEIR mercury. Even bigger fish then eat those, get their mercury, and so on. Result is that very big fish can build up higher than desired concentrations of mercury. Much like before, this doesn't mean ""stop eating big fish!"", simply that you should limit your consumption of these fish to a couple servings a week (which, personally, sucks because I'm a sucker for tuna...)."
nutrition,"Baby carrots, I like them warmed with popcorn seasoning. Delicious, healthy and a great substitute for nachos/ corn chips/ crisps"
nutrition,"Wouldn't any cleanse or ""detox"" be bad?"
nutrition,Salted
nutrition,I bet there’s natural stuff from which nutrients are worse absorbed than from some synthetic stuff.
nutrition,"Lots of bad ingredients, vegetable oils, soy, sugar (and ""hidden sugars""), etc."
nutrition,You think these are in general worse for you than real processed meat?
nutrition,Anything 'low-fat' or 'high fiber' out any other buzz words that make you think your doing something good for your body when if you look at the ingredients it's actually awful.  They usually have sugar or artificial sweeteners or a ton of fillers.  Just eat smaller accounts of the real thing

nutrition,"Just adding my anecdote to this point: I used to work as a forestry firefighter and we were supplied Gatorade but were instructed to dilute the Gatorade with our water, not only to make it last longer but because Gatorade generally had too high of a sugar concentration to rehydrate effectively and would have the opposite effect, even for guys and gals working hard, sweating profusely for 12 hours a day during the hottest time of year."

nutrition,I like the supremely spicy hummus that sabra makes
nutrition,"It’s really sad that the health and wellness community has gotten to a point where this question needs to be addressed. 

From my understanding, because fruit contains fructose, eating too much too quickly can result in weight gain.  But you’d have to eat a lot to have that happen, and in no way shape or form should you avoid fruit."

nutrition,"I’ve always thought a plant based diet would be a great option. I’m currently reading “How Not To Die” and Dr. Michael Gregor who wrote that is a strong advocate for plant based food. If I weren’t trying to gain muscle I’d probably do it, but otherwise it’s so hard getting all your daily protein in from lentils, beans, nuts etc. (definitely doable, I’m just a lazy fuck). 

Thank you for the link though I’ll give it a read."
nutrition,I feel like this is an overexaggerated thing. Many low-fat alternatives don't actually add sugars as many seem to suggest on here.

The animal based diet causes our body in increase stomach acid changing the pH of the stomach which allowed different bacteria to flourish.  The bacteria that flourishes in an acidic environment seems to be less ideal for our body.  

With that said.  I think salmon, chicken, eggs can def be part of a healthy diet.  As long as you’re also eating a good amount of vegetables and some fruit I think it’s absolutely fine.

nutrition,Why
nutrition,"Sounds like a great diet. If you want to eat fruits though, you can. High GI doesn't mean bad and most fruit GI isn't that high anyway. GI also doesn't actually count when you eat it with other food because it slows the digestion of that food. GI is overhyped. Parsnips have a high GI but are healthy while table sugar has a lower GI than parsnips but I'd never say table sugar is healthy. What I'm trying to say is that judging a food by GI is pointless and you're restricting yourself of foods when you don't need to."

nutrition,"&gt;Relative to saturated fat, especially animal fat, yes, PUFAs are better for you

Hmm, the study in the article I posted said that PUFAs were healthier than carbs AND saturated fat, equally. That makes vegetable oils healthier than most of what people eat on a daily basis. Harvard appears to be aware of that and are unequivocal that vegetable oils should be encouraged, I don't think they say it needs to be limited to 1 tbsp.

Dairy tends to have beneficial associations with CVD outcomes so I don't think saturated fat is inherently bad anyway. Maybe the palm oil in processed food is a bit bad though."
nutrition,"Squeeze the orange,  toss the juice, eat the leftover fruit.   All the fiber without all the sugar."
nutrition,"A couple things to keep in mind: Relative to saturated fat, especially animal fat, yes, PUFAs are better for you.  (Incidentally, coconut oil is almost completely saturated fat.)  But even with the healthier choices of oil, you're not recommended to consume more than about a tablespoon per day.

nutrition,"On the face of it I would simply doubt this. Nutrition has always had a chip on its shoulder about saturated fat and they just think its ok to blame it for anything and everything. I am aware of some data that could be used to support that position but consider it fairly unvalidated and unlikely to matter in reality.

I imagine it is plausible there might be studies finding that people who report eating more saturated fat tend to be more overweight. This would be a poor form of evidence to rely on.

This study ranked several foods by their associations with weight gain. By far the strongest association was for french fries, which is tentatively assumed to be made with unsaturated vegetable oils. Saturated fat containing foods like cheese were not associated with weight gain.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21696306/

To get into the biochemistry, it is actually known that PUFAs are strong activators of the various PPAR's that can drive beta oxidation. There are studies showing they are pushed into energy quicker and are ""more ketogenic"" than other fatty acids. On the other hand there is a suspicion that the endocannabinoids and signalling molecules produced from omega 6 PUFAs may drive addictive behaviours like overeating.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23762050/

On the other other hand, stearic acid (C18:0) has also been linked to increased beta oxidation. And saturated MCTs also clearly raise energy expenditure so who knows what will win in terms of realistic human behaviours.

nutrition,"Whole fruits, he explained, contain a bounty of antioxidants and healthful nutrients, and their cellular scaffolding, made of fiber, makes us feel full and provides other metabolic benefits. When you bite into an apple, for example, the fruit’s fiber helps slow your absorption of fructose, the main sugar in most fruits. But fiber is not the full story.

“You can’t just take an 8-ounce glass of cola and add a serving of Metamucil and create a health food,” Dr. Ludwig said. “Even though the fructose-to-fiber ratio might be the same as an apple, the biological effects would be much different.”

Fiber provides “its greatest benefit when the cell walls that contain it remain intact,” he said. Sugars are effectively sequestered in the fruit’s cells, he explained, and it takes time for the digestive tract to break down those cells. The sugars therefore enter the bloodstream slowly, giving the liver more time to metabolize them. Four apples may contain the same amount of sugar as 24 ounces of soda, but the slow rate of absorption minimizes any surge in blood sugar. Repeated surges in blood sugar make the pancreas work harder and can contribute to insulin resistance, thereby increasing the risk for Type 2 diabetes.

“If we take a nutrient-centric approach, just looking at sugar grams on the label, none of this is evident,” Dr. Ludwig said. “So it really requires a whole foods view""

I don't think fasting is that bad, but it definitely attracts a lot of anorexics. It isn't supposed to hurt though, you're supposed to feel mostly fine."
nutrition,Best explanation! Whole fruit is great for you.
nutrition,"If you read above, I actually agreed with you that the sugars are the same but the way the sugar is processed is different. I also said it’s processed different because of the aspects of the fruit, which includes fiber. Also, the body has to break down the fruit itself before the process can be processed as opposed to just eating pure sugar and only break down the carb itself. However, you do whatever you want man. Drink 5 L of coke a day or avoid fruits all together - your life."
nutrition,"So his problem was primarily being overweight? What do you think would have happened if he cut his intake of something else instead? I don't know whether he ate cheese, sausages, butter, eggs or whatever. Would his fruit intake still have caused issues, you reckon?"
nutrition,"No fruit and carbs are not bad! There is really no bad food. 
I follow some registered dieticians on IG and they all really talk about NOT cutting out ANY foods! Unless you have a sensitivity or allergy or don't like it. And buildings your meals around protein, add in veg and a startch!

Agreed. That's not at all what /u/Themedicaladvisor was saying."
nutrition,"Everything in moderation! I've never ever been a sweets or sugar person nor has fruit ever been on my grocery list(minus frozen for smoothies) but now that my nutrition and health is on track with an intentionally active lifestyle I find myself craving fresh fruit. 

I'm listening to my body and theres no way my modest bowl of fresh mango and strawberries I had today is bad for it. Now if I had massive amounts everyday or mindlessly snacked on it I imagine that could be problematic and add up pretty fast."
nutrition,"I \*did\* choose grapes for a reason; the glycemic index of grapes is pretty close to grape juice. 

My point is just that if you eat a lot of fruit, you'll end up with a lot of sugar, and grapes in particular have a high glycemic index. 

Fruit is a better choice than fruit juice or soda, definitely. But that doesn't mean you should eat as much as you want. I knew I guy who was eating 8 servings of fruit a day, and that ended up not working very well for him metabolically."
nutrition,"The only thing I would add if you are diabetic you may need to measure the portion of fruit you eat at one time but you still can eat fruit. 

For me I’ve gone from a diabetic H1ac to a prediabetic H1ac and have not cut out fruit. Depending on the fruit the amount I eat can vary due to how it may raise my blood sugar but I replaced a lot of the sweets I use to eat with whole fruit.  So far I’ve lost 55 lbs calorie counting and doing moderate carbs (100 to 150 per day)

People are too afraid of carbs now due to some types of diets but you have to take into account the source of the carbs. Cutting out whole fruit for me was too restrictive. I, however, no longer drink juice.

Hope this helps"
nutrition,Ngl I could easily eat a bowl of strawberries and two bananas in one sitting 😂
nutrition,"I'm no nutritionist, however whole fruit (important you eat the skins too) have fiber, minerals and vitamins in them that would not be present in sugar.

Like anything, moderation is key. It's kind of hard to do on fruit though considering most of it is water and will make you feel full."
nutrition,"I agree with all of that. 

But I don't think anybody is suggesting that a can of soda - which might be more comparable - is a good idea. There are many people who say that you can eat as much fruit as you want."
nutrition,"How much fruit are you eating? Having a piece of fruit a day is fine. Having an apple, two bananas, an orange, and grapes is probably too much unless spaced out throughout the day. 

The other thing is to factor in that not all fruit is created equal as was mentioned earlier here. There are some fruits that have higher fiber or in the case of avocado even contains fat as well as fiber."

Someone else mentioned electrolytes, which I agree with. You can get electrolyte powder which can be added to water to chug before you begin your fast

It might be a good idea to adjust your work outs until Ramadan is over. Either reducing the intensity, or you could just move it to morning or evening, whichever is easier for you

I'm fasting right now too, and this is what I'm trying. It's working so far :)"
nutrition,MCT oil always helps me feel full and energized when I can’t eat for a while. I add some to a protein smoothie or add to your food.

nutrition,any examples
nutrition,lol
nutrition,dw about it ;)
nutrition,oh sorry I thought you meant drink water while fasting
nutrition,... you can’t eat during the day either. I was talking about when he/she CAN eat.
nutrition,"Do you mean to eat ahead of time and last the longest, or consume during the fast? I'm familiar with some stuff that might work for both, but don't have much experience with the parameters of Ramadan.

For stuff that is slow to digest, think proteins and fats. Maybe some fibrous grains like brown/wild rice, even oatmeal. It's just about what takes the longest to become accessible, proteins and fats fall into that category, especially meat, protein contributes to a feeling of fullness also, it might seem obvious but adding more just increases the time it takes to digest and stay readily available as energy. I've found eating a giant meal can tide me over for a while, especially if I'm not exactly famished when eating it.

If it's more of an intermittent fast, I really like miso broth, but have also done beef broth during a fast, which is good. Basically any broth.

You could probably just eat like a hog beforehand, and then forget about eating for most of the day. Having your mindset in the right place (just forgetting about food) is the biggest part."
nutrition,Bacon is my top choice.
nutrition,I don’t think you can drink water during the day during Ramadan
nutrition,Focus on protein.
nutrition,Protein is the most filling!

Also, don’t forget to eat a lot of protein or you will suffer from muscle loss.

Finally, but most importantly, DRINK WATER!"

nutrition,"That isn't how fasting for Ramadan works though, you have to fast during daylight I believe"
nutrition,Just avoid sugar and you will be okay
nutrition,Start your fast after your evening meal.  Use most of the 16 hours after this meal and your sleep time. Just skip breakfast and you got it made. That’s what I do everyday
nutrition,"I'd say casein is important since it's a slow release protein, same for complex carbs.

Also fasting 16h is nothing impossible where you HAVE TO eat something before, it's mostly a mental thing where you have to overcome the need of eating. It's not that hard if you apply yourself. r/fasting can help you with that. You can find there people that easily fasts for weeks"

I'd eat more if it was cheaper. At the moment it is more expensive than just buying 90% dark chocolate."

I drink half at 6 AM then the other half at 8-9 AM so I get better protein and nutrient absorption.  Usually start getting pretty hungry around 11 again. Take lunch at 12. 

I’d recommend adding seeds and a few other things optimize the macros.  Fruit and Greek yogurt is great, but can always be improved."

&amp;#x200B;

It started a bit more than a year ago. I was trying to gain weight because im really skinny and i input in MyFitnessPal that i wanted to gain a pound a week. this must have been a big jump in calories because I realized it was hard to chomp down so much food and i started burping and farting a lot. Like every single meal. So im assuming my digestive system had to slow down... but i was eating pretty good food like pasta, eggs, veggies, peanut butter, etc. and then one day, i just started getting acid coming back up my throat after almost every meal. I found no way to stop it other than slowing way down on eating and dropped all the way back to my started weight. it stopped. I waited a while and tried it again... but same results. So all of this time I've been convinced that i can just never gain weight. I noticed that once i hit 136 pounds, i start getting acid reflux until i lose weight. im usually fully good if im 134 pounds which is just above underweight for my height. I hate being skinny

&amp;#x200B;

I also work out and eat a lot of fiber and a lot of fat but almost all healthy foods. Every other day ill have some chips or ice cream but other than that, its all good for you food that i eat (i prepare every meal from scratch). So im thinking that either im eating too much fiber, too much fat, eating too many calories and not letting my digestive catch up, or maybe when my stomach expands, it puts pressure on  something that causes acid to come back up my throat. I have been on the hunt for the answer for almost 2 years. Any advice is appreciated"

The majority of bodies crave fatty, dense, warming foods during cold months and our liver has to process all of that hard to digest, heavy food. So, when spring comes our liver could be a bit stressed. Most people will crave lighter fair and start eating more veggies as well as less dairy and meat which gives our liver support. For this reason, it is a great time to help it out even more and do a small liver cleanse since technically our bodies are expecting it. It's not like you can't cleanse your liver at other times but this is just a less traumatic experience for the body, imo. I hope that made sense.

nutrition,"There are some great herbal teas you can look into that could be helpful and still stay within keto restrictions, like black cohosh, vitex/chaste berry, or dong quai. I would speak with a practicioner in your area or your doctor to get a better picture. Hormones are nothing to be toyed with, in my experience. NAC might also be a good option for you. It is basically an amino acid so should be keto cool and can be helpful to the liver while your in a diet transition. It's spring time too (well in my neck of the woods) perfect time to take care of the liver. https://blog.metabolicmaintenance.com/n-acetyl-l-cysteine-for-hormone-support/

Listen to your body and take it slow, good luck!"
nutrition,"One tip for making these is to keep the temp lower than normal pancakes on the pan you're using. Often times the extra sweeteners in the protein powders means that they will carmelize/brown quicker than regular pancakes, and thus have an easier potential to burn.

They'll never be as good as regular pancakes, but they hit the spot if you've got some calorie goals that need protein."

We also address the likelihood that cooking was adopted more than 250,000 years ago (kya), a period that we believe is sufficient in length for the proposed adaptations to have occurred. Additional experimental work is needed to help discriminate the relative contributions of cooking, meat eating, and other innovations such as nonthermal food processing in supporting the human transition toward dietary quality.""

""Here, we describe a system for characterizing the energetic effects of cooking and nonthermal food processing. Using mice as a model, we show that cooking substantially increases the energy gained from meat, leading to elevations in body mass that are not attributable to differences in food intake or activity levels. The positive energetic effects of cooking were found to be superior to the effects of pounding in both meat and starch-rich tubers, a conclusion further supported by food preferences in fasted animals. Our results indicate significant contributions from cooking to both modern and ancestral human energy budgets. They also illuminate a weakness in current food labeling practices, which systematically overestimate the caloric potential of poorly processed foods"""

Here’s the real question OP: who do you trust? Redditors who cite no scientific study to support their claims and tell you what you want to hear?

Or the collection of experts/scientists who study these things for a living?

The choice is yours."
nutrition,"Firstly congratulations on improving your eating habits. You could be in a calorie deficit but the thing about BMR is that it's not static. It differs daily or even hourly and by the minute. If you eat food on day 1 and on day 2 you don't eat food, you will actually burn more calories on day 1 because of the energy required to digest the food. You took in more energy because you ate but some energy is used to digest the food. Remember that calories in vs out is independent of one another. This phenomenom is called 'thermogenic effect of food' (TEF). Protein has the highest TEF, sometimes up to 30% of their calories. This means if you eat 100 calories of protein, you could potentially burn 30 and be left with 70.  
What I'm trying to say is that while you may be eating less than before, you might not necessarily be undereating because the BMR is flexible in a sense. But since you mention you are exercising a lot, it's possible that you might be undereating but if you're generally healthy, I think you'll find that your body will give you the right signals. If you're hungry, eat and if you're full, don't eat. However, if you are concerned, you could always snack on some nuts or get a cheap protein powder to get some extra calories in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I myself, actually recently spent about 2 years eating 1000 calories less than I did for the decades prior and just recently I wanted to experiment with bulking up again and began to eat about 1000-1500 extra calories worth. It's incredibly difficult but it seems my BMR hasn't changed in those two years."
nutrition,"Every day for the last 9 months (like literally every day) I’ve eaten Chobani non fat Greek yogurt with diced strawberries, as well as scrambled eggs with avocado on the side. HIGHLY recommend. Great way to get your protein and healthy fats. And you feel great for the rest of the morning"
nutrition,Do pumpkim seeds help regulate hormones?
nutrition,"Probably too much honestly. I struggle with binge eating sweets. Ice cream, pastries, etc. Unfortunately I’m not too sure because I didn’t track it prior. But basically I was eating lot of carbs via veggies and greens but also binge eating carbs such as processed sweets"
nutrition,"How much fat did you eat before your change? Fat is hardest to break down in the stomach and requires the most enzymatic action. If you're not used to eating a lot of fat, your body isn't routinely used to creating enough enzymes and bile to break down the fat so it's basically just sitting there in the stomach for longer than other foods tend to do. Fat can also trigger higher amounts of satiety feelings in some people via a hormone called cholecystokinin.  


IF this is what is going on, you might be overeating on fat. Try to reduce it and then increase it slowly over time instead because your liver is simply not producing enough bile at this point.  


That's a possibility but I'm not a medical professional."
nutrition,Have you tried coconut yogurt? I loveeee yogurt but stopped eating it as the diary was breaking me out. Love coconut yogurt as a substitute
nutrition,Me too! Toasted walnuts and fresh blueberries. It’s my dessert nearly every night :)
nutrition,I prefer skyr too! It’s like go to breakfast!
nutrition,"Second for overnight oats. I do: 
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup almond mink 
1 tbs chia seed
Little bit of honey 
1 tsp vanilla extract 

Then usually topped with different things different days.. fresh berries, frozen berries, peanut butter banana.. whatever you want to mix it up and keep it interesting. Super easy and I can prep 3-4 at a time."
nutrition,"Good start :) they can still add excessive sugar through fruits/honey (which doesn’t count as added sugar). 
The brand i use now has 7g total sugars. 
Also sugar alcohols don’t count towards sugar but are partly like sugar."
nutrition,You really need to switch to full fat and then you'll be swish
nutrition,True! I think this subject isn't discussed enough in nutrition.
nutrition,"You're right that how the food is cooked determines the severity.

However, even boiled food will have more AGEs than their raw counter-parts."
nutrition,"OP asked about any health risks associated with meat, so I provided some. Don’t recall anyone saying anything about buns or doughnuts."
nutrition,Yep. UVA through glass only. B and C become heat which is why greenhouses work.
nutrition,How many eggs do you usually make at once? I'm trying to figure out how many burritos I'd be able to make at once and store because this sounds good.
nutrition,I love making a breakfast casserole the night before. It will last for awhile and all I have to do is heat up a piece every morning. Ideas on Pinterest! 😊
nutrition,178cal x 0.09 = 16.02 cal
nutrition,"You are already getting enough protein from some of the best protein sources, you should be looking to cut carbs/fats.  It's hard to recommend without knowing portion sizes but the pasta and nuts stand out to me as high calorie foods you could consume less of.

&gt; usually close to 100 g of fat 

Why does this happen?  Can you stop it from happening?"
nutrition,"""The mechanism for hunger suppression is thought to be a decrease in the rate of gastric emptying""

Sounds like slowed digestion to me. Maybe actually read the article instead of waiting for it to be spoofed to you"
nutrition,Yes exactly.
nutrition,I think this will be easy to prove one way or the other using a blood glucose meter and running the two experiments. Personally I’d hypothesize that adding vegetables won’t reduce your bodies glycemic response given that the fiber in whole grains bind to the carbs versus white rice being freely exposed to digestive enzymes in your gut
nutrition,"Nice information, thanks for sharing! 

What do you think about people being in a caloric deficit? I consider myself a healthy resistance trained adult and I am cutting at the moment. Any idea if the 1.8 would change in that case?"
nutrition,"If you eat a good amount and variety of vegetables throughout the week, I wouldn't worry about multivitamins at all. You could probably take one every week and you'd be fine, if you feel you must. If you want to put on weight, I don't know what to say other than eat more and if that's difficult, maybe get yourself a protein powder drink without any added vitamins. You won't be able to overdose on protein and it's always easier to squeeze down a drink rather than more food when you're beginning to feel full."
nutrition,"That sounds good actually! I used to put as much fruit as possible in mine (a lot of apples too), as I was sure that the more fruit I ate, the better - which is in fact true, I'm not demonizing fruit! But when blended we might end up eating amounts of it that we would never eat if it was whole, without realizing, and ending up feeling heavy and with a sugar peak. The golden rule I was given was ""put in your smoothie as much fruit as you'd eat on itself""."
nutrition,"I’ve definitely been there with the burn out! I don’t do resolutions anymore for that reason, especially if it’s something I want to do why wait for a certain date to begin? That’s never made sense to me. But I tried doing P90x and couldn’t even get through the shortest workout! My hip flexors are very week. But I’m hoping the Pilates and abs of steel will strengthen them and that I can run again if not next month then two months from now."
nutrition,"Firstly, I'd suggest seeing a medical professional. But, if you ask me, I'd tell you to gradually start eating less dairy. Not because dairy is overall bad but because it looks to me like you're eating too much of it. You don't have to go vegan, but fatty food in general can increase cholesterol. You could change those fatty protein sources with leaner protein, more chicken instead, or more protein powder instead, and I bet you in a month, your cholesterol levels will reduce. Now high cholesterol might actually not necessarily be a bad thing. It could be, but it also might not be. 

Triglycerides are fuel in the form of fat and triglycerides can't travel in the blood because it's hydrophobic. Remember the water and fat don't mix etc? That would happen in the bloodstream which would be disastrous. As a solution to that, triglycerides are packaged in lipoproteins (proteins) which is ""basically"" cholesterol (LDL = Low Density Lipoprotein) so now it can travel in your bloodstream. That could be why your cholesterol is high.

I understand that you're trying to bulk, but I'd start by reducing the amount of dairy you're consuming to perhaps half of what you're consuming and if that doesn't work, I'd have to suggest  a mild caloric deficit and see how that affects your cholesterol. There's evidence that a caloric deficit is very effective in reducing cholesterol. You might be lean but it's actually possible to to consume too much without gaining weight and you could be such a case. I once was myself."
nutrition,Thank you so much! I use mango strawberry and blackberry for my smoothie. It’s a small cup not something big maybe 12 oz. I’m not sure if that’s bad ? I recently did an analysis and was told nothing about my sugar levels
nutrition,"If you want to go plant-based, you should try to get used to pulses and legumes. The first couple of weeks they can cause some bloating, but that's completely normal, it's your gut getting used to digest them. 
Moreover (and this is true for whatever regime you follow), you should try to eat the widest possible variety of vegetables and fruits: this will stimulate your gut to produce a lively microbiome, which is essential to a healthy metabolism. If you eat only kale/spinach or anyway too few vegetables, your gut can get ""lazy"", very much similar to what happens with your muscles when you do the same workout everyday without changing/upgrading it. When it comes to the smoothie though, keep an eye on not putting too many fruits in there, or it'll come out as a sugar bomb (I learned this the hard way lmao, first thing the nutritionist taught me) - a couple of fruits like banana and blueberries, plus a green leaf veg, will do the trick.

Edit: if you go plant based remember to eat some nuts and seeds, especially walnuts and flaxseed, for Omega-acids."
nutrition,"For sure, anything will work. The most important thing is that you do some kind of exercise that you enjoy because that makes it easier to stick to it. Countless people make the same mistake to jump right into some crazy exercise only to get intimidated by it because it's too hard or not fun for them so they quit. It goes like that for anything, like when people do new years resolutions, they jump right into it instead of gradually building into it.  


If somebody wants to work out but aren't in shape, it's infinitely better to start out by doing just 1 push up. Maybe next day or even next week, do 2 push ups. That's not at all intimidating for probably the majority of people, but starting the new year with doing 100 push ups when you aren't used to it, now that's hard and demoralising."
nutrition,"Visceral fat is more metabolically active, as in it has more more blood vessels and more hormone receptors and has a higher response in your autonomic nervous system. This essentially means that it's very responsive to exercise. If you continue to do your lifting, you will lose your visceral fat. If you exercise frequently, it will go. You need to be at least in some caloric deficit. Try a month, a few weeks etc. However long you think is appropriate. In this time, there's a chance you won't see improvements in your progressive overload, but maybe you will because everyone differs. The best thing to do is to measure your waist every week that passes and if you don't see an improvement in 2 weeks, then you'll have to reduce your calorie intake a bit more."
nutrition,"My honest recommendation is to find a nutritionist to work with. They are trained to look at the individual in front of them, take all the knowledge they have about nutrition and help guide you through the mud. They can help plan meals, give ideas for reaching your goals and work with your doctor to help make sure you’re not deficient. Good luck!"
nutrition,Thank you this is great advice! I’d normally start running but I’m getting older and my knees were hurting quite a bit. So I’m doing Pilates / abs of steel videos 3x a week for a month until maybe I can run again. This will probably be the easiest.
nutrition,"Studies have shown fasting to have benefits for many with metabolic disorders or other chronic conditions, and for some others it works really well for energy and weight loss. However, every human body is different, needs different fuel and fasting doesn’t work for all. You could try something short at first to see how you do, like a circadian rhythm fast (only eating when the sun is up) or maybe a 16:8 (fast 16 hours from dinner time through the night to late morning and then eat normally and so on. I do a 16:8 nearly every day and break my fast with a healthy smoothie to regulate my blood sugar. Hope that helps!"
nutrition,"It's good that you acknowledge that your diet isn't ideal. Firstly if I were you I'd consult a medical professional regarding lowering your cholesterol. 

&amp;#x200B;

But if you ask me, there's a ton of evidence that suggests that the best thing you can do is exercise. 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, if you eat junk food every day, then you can reduce your junk food consumption little by little, week by week. Monday, no junk food. Next week, Monday and wednesday no junk food, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of exercise, any exercise will work for you but my personal favourite is any kind of high intensity workout, even a short one that lasts 15-30 minutes. Using your muscles for something intense will cause your heart to pump very fast, your respiration has increased possibly by more than double the speed as your resting state. This is effective because your muscles have worked hard and your heart will continue to work faster and the regeneration of your muscles causes a lot of heat production which means you're burning more energy for hours after your workout is done. For some people that post exercise heat production lasts 24 hours.  


A general caloric deficit is also incredibly effective at reducing cholesterol levels."
nutrition,"Smoothies are great because you can mix in greens, proteins, fiber and healthy fats into one glass!"
nutrition,"It sounds to me like you're exactly on the right path. What makes you believe you're not going to lose more fat? Has your scale been stuck around the same range for a while? You've done really well so far, sticking to your regime for half a year. It's actually incredibly healthy to lose excess fat slowly, rather than quickly as your body can experience metabolic adaptation which I think many know as ""slowing of your metabolism"". That said, your simple carbs like rice and pasta could be replaced with their wholegrain counterparts at the very least, or you can cut some fat or carbs and eat protein instead. Protein is satiating and can have up to a 30% thermogenic effect."

nutrition,"You might want to look into chia seeds as a fat blocker for weight loss to block out fat content. 

 I haven't tried anything with them yet but you can eat them, they won't do anything unusual to your blender.

However I recommend that you go with a coffee bean grinder if you want them ground. 

Or add some fluid to them in the blender to mix it up.

You should add water to them and soak them so they don't swell up in your belly."

The annoying thing is that I’ve still got a bit of belly fat/love handles that I’d like to get rid of. I get the sense that it’s mainly my diet that’s the problem but I’m not certain as to what aspect of it. I eat fairly healthy, I never snack unless it’s an apple or orange after dinner, I avoid soft drinks like the plague, I never eat cake or pie or cookies and the only things I eat that are I suppose less than ideal are breakfast, for which I usually have special K’s cinnamon protein cereal or their almond crunch stuff. Both of which are better than most other cereals on the market. That or my consumption of rice/pasta. I’ll have rice or pasta maybe three nights per week. Which of these are the culprits of all the fat retention and what can I eat instead?"

I'd love to discuss that topic. I was referring to stuff like [this](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/the-three-laws-of-protein/) (2nd point of the article)."

nutrition,"From the article:

The greatest stimulator of CCK release is the presence of fatty acids and/or certain amino acids in the chyme entering the duodenum"
nutrition,Because 3 x 500cal is nothing. That’s like 3 lots of beans on toast. Also most diets consist of lots of processed food and alcohol which are very calorific.
nutrition,"For sure. The American obesity problem is compounded by the fact that their food has different regulations than most of the world, so their food is really sugary. Along with the fact that America &amp; Canada are pretty much built for cars. I’ve been in some really nice neighbourhoods with no stores around for miles, and no sidewalks so it’s not feasible to walk. It’s just organized terribly lol."
nutrition,"With that math they would be, so my guess is snacks, drinks, alcohol and meals with more than 500 calories. You can easily get 1500 calories from a mcdonalds meal. This could also be combined with a general lack of exercise if you drive everywhere and don’t workout."
nutrition,Interesting. Thanks!
nutrition,There is no evidence that lots of protein damages your liver.
nutrition,"&gt;Sounds like it may be a matter of maintaining the appropriate balance for the individual. 

Agreed.  My point here is that there is some evidence in this study that there is no impact to GI load by including protein with carbs.   I've seen nothing posted so far which contradicts that other than anecdotal evidence."
nutrition,"you don't have to have LOTS of protein, beacause it could damage your liver and you can't absorb it all, so its kinda pointless. have like 1g per lbs of weight (can bit over by like 20g or maybe more if having a cheat day or just treating yourself but too much long term is dangerous). and like the other person said lean meet, chicken breast, turkey, egg whites, tuna, mackerel, salmon (kinda high cal  but healthy fats). greek yoghurt, protein powder (120-130cal for 30g protein), veggie quorn substitutes, tofu!!!"

On the other hand, these individuals might be more susceptible to body protein loss during dietary protein restriction. Definitive answers to these concerns are still unknown.8""

nutrition,"A high protein intake raises IGF-1 no matter the calories intake, which is why people pursue it for gaining muscle (people on gear peruse it all the time). A reasonable to high-normal intake when cutting is optimal. Don't kill your fat intake, don't overdo the carbs (if you're *too* sluggish after meals you probably overdid it, or lack chromium maybe) and fill the rest with protein, all while eating as clean as possible. Bless homemade protein ice cream. 

As for how to calculate the daily amount of macros, id use something like Cronometer if your looking for an app, or I'd find the research on examine.com.

MorePlatesMoreDates is something you should check out imo, as is Dan Johns work (especially MassMadeSimple) and the book ""Keys to Progress""  (all of these have something about nutrition mentioned in their work, not just exercise sruff)"
nutrition,"Thanks for the info, I kinda knew about the carbs protein and fats being part of macro but how to calculate it. I see some people posting about 1.8g per Lb of body weight for protein and the rest should be carbs and fats, but I’m unsure how to calculate that. If that makes sense"
nutrition,"Macros (or macronutrients) are carbohydrates, protein and fat. Every food contains at least one of these three macronutrients. Carbohydrates and protein have 4 calories per gram, and fat has 9 calories per gram, where calories are a unit of energy. If you are bodybuilding, you probably want to focus on getting enough calories to gain weight and enough protein to build muscle."
nutrition,Check out r/fasting
nutrition,Lean meat like chicken breast is probably your best option. I would just make protein a priority at every meal. Set your calorie goal and plan your meals and make sure you have a good source of protein with every meal.
nutrition,"Your link states no connections at all between protein ingestion and effect on GI of a carbohydrate.  If you have some evidence, please post it."
nutrition,Thanks. I was curious about water fasts.
nutrition,"&gt; When protein and glucose were combined, the peak response was     similar to that of glucose alone. However, during the late postprandial period, the     glucose response was reduced by 34%. The insulin responses for protein and glucose were     similar, but when combined the insulin response was nearly doubled. The glucose decrease     when protein and glucose were combined was attributed to the increased insulin response to     the combination. See Figure 1."

nutrition,"Makes sense, as protein requires some churning time in the stomach's acidic pepsin to break down, whereas carbs begin their breakdown upon mixing with amylase in saliva.

nutrition,"I don’t know about exact same effect, gram for gram, but fiber (and fat) does slow the uptake of insulin by 1) displacing some of the carbs that may be absorbed by small intestine and/or 2) translocating the carb to a point lower in the intestinal tract where less insulin secretion is shown.  I imagine this effect is less than changing to brown rice, which protects from insulin spike by directly creating a barrier between the carb and the intestinal lining. But it’s better than nothing."

**THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR WEIGHT CHALLENGES ARE HORMONAL.**

In NEW YOURK TIMES, there is an article says that 99 percent of the weight loss resistance is hormonal.

According to Dr, Wood ,who is one of the top hormone experts, there are five hormonal blocks that affect millions of women and men. These hormonal blocks causes something called (Weight Loss Resistance), So, it would be impossible to drop even one pound. The solution is to adjust and fix these hormonal blocks in order to be easy and possible to loss weight.

THE FIVE HORMONAL BLOCKS ARE:

1. THYROID.
2. CORTISOL.
3. ESTROGEN.
4. INSULIN.
5. LEPTIN.

One of the most powerful and efficient treatment is **HB5** which refers to: (Hormonal Balance 5)

HB5 increases the energy in the body, makes the mood much better, improves the sleep and the **most important purpose it burns the fat.**

nutrition,"It makes sense in theory, but using LBM doesn’t seem realistic as most people don’t have the resources to access BIA machine or DEXA. 

My personal view on it is that protein should be prioritized as it’s the most important nutrient with regards to body composition changes and dieting in general, regardless of the goal. Even for someone who isn’t looking to build muscle, protein is about as satiating as fat (more satiating when you adjust for calories) and has a higher thermic effect during digestion. That being said, a majority of people who want to lose weight also want to gain muscle mass, which will be much easier to do when erring towards a larger protein intake than a smaller one. Overall, a chronic excess of protein consumption (let’s say 20-50g/day) is going to have a significantly more positive impact on body comp than calorie-equated excess CHO or fat consumption. 

There are many reasons why I believe protein should be prioritized, but mainly the satiating nature and muscle building properties. I’ve also realized that there are a million different ways to prepare different types of meat, which combats what I think is the biggest obstacle during diets, which is boredom with food due to a lack of variety. 

At the end of the day, though, I understand that not everybody really enjoys eating a lot of protein. Many people who are busy 5-7 days/week find it easier to snack or have small meals, which makes complete sense."

Is there a way to control visceral fat loss and subcutaneous fat maintenance/gain while still trying to improve muscle mass and strength in powerlifting? I have a healthy body image but would like to minimize health risks for when I'm 50."
nutrition,"The label you linked actually proves my point about the ingredients pretty well. While the one you purchased contains no carageenan, the fillers it uses are black locust gum and gellan gum. The other ingredients are either ""almond milk"" (water+almonds), salt, or vitamins used to enrich the product (add nutrients that are not otherwise present).

Milk, by comparison, requires no fortification/enrichment to be a nutrient-dense beverage. Of course, US milk producers generally add vitamin D (sometimes vit A too), but even without the added vitamin D, milk is packed with vitamins (A, D, and most of the B's), minerals (e.g. calcium, potassium, phosphorous, iron, and trace minerals), protein (1g pro per serving in the almond milk, compared to 8g pro per serving of milk), and essential fatty acids. 

Consider the almond milk: the vit D, vit A, vit B12, and vit E were all added during the production process, as indicated by the ingredient list - had they not been added, what would the nutrition profile look like? It probably wouldn't be much more than carbs, fat, and negligible amounts of protein listed - likely no vitamins or minerals listed at all.

(Another interesting note, is that calories from protein in the milk, is pretty close to the total number of calories in the almond milk - approx 32 kcal from protein in the milk, compared to the entire serving of almond milk as 40 kcal.) Protein is a very important nutrient in milk substitutes, so the fact that almond milk has only 1g is significant. Further, we don't even know for sure that it even has 1g of it, as producers are allowed to round up from 0.5g on the label; in other words, as long as it has at least half a gram of protein, the manufacturers can say it has a gram. 

--------

Interestingly, I think that this kind of label-rounding is happening with the almond milk you linked.

Unsalted almond label for reference (from google): https://media.fooducate.com/comments/images/598DDF2A-4EF3-90FD-4517-920467B12BFD-29693.jpeg

1 serving size of almonds is 160 kcal and provides 6g protein. 1 serving size of the almond milk is 40 kcal and provides 1g protein. Kcal-wise, the almond milk is a 1/4 of the calories, but 1/6 the protein. Going by ratios, I'd expect the label to say 1.5g (25% of 6g), or the label to round from up to 2g. Also, if you math out the calories, it seems right (27 kcal from fat, 4 from pro, 8 from cho; adds up to 39 kcal and rounds to 40 kcal). However, keep in mind that the manufacturer added vitamins A, D, and E which are all fat soluble, and likely were lipid solutions (easier to mix than powdered forms), meaning that adding them bumps up the fat content and calories. Doing this, would explain why the protein appears lower than the expected 1.5g to 2g based on the ratio. Pure speculation, though.

--------

Now again, to be clear, my goal is not to trash on almond milk as a beverage. I am simply saying that it should not be considered a milk substitute from a nutritional perspective. As far as nutrition is concerned, one serving of almond milk is functionally the equivalent of about 5-7 almonds and a glass of water. Almond milk is not nutrient dense enough to be a proper milk substitute."

I personally eat green leaves like a giraffe and don't worry about kidney stones. You might try mixing it up with other greens: kale, collard, chard, etc. The known benefits are too great to sacrifice for avoiding a low probability concern. For the vast majority of people, the best way to avoid kidney stones is to simply stay hydrated. Make sure to drink a minimum of 2.5 L of water per day- much more if you are sweating a lot (working out or it’s hot) and you won't have any issues.

These are also foods and substances that prevent and / or help dissolve already-existing kidney stones. Lemon juice, cranberry juice, and apple cider vinegar (ACV) are fine examples.  Citrate, a salt in citric acid (as found in lemon juice, ACV, etc), binds to calcium and helps block stone formation.

The fact that your body does not derive energy from it means it’s not really “good” or “bad”, it simply exists, and if your body isn’t using it, it doesn’t just magically vanish - it has to come out.

There is a limit on how much fat the body can breakdown within a limited time frame. That's why bodybuilders cut weight at a small deficit. The larger the deficit, the more of that energy will come from muscle breakdown in addition to fat. Especially if there is a lot of glycolytic activity which requires carbohydrate or protein breakdown to fuel."

nutrition,"Yes. The key with these two minerals is balance. Magnesium is mandatory for the proper assimilation and use of calcium, as well as other important nutrients. If we consume too much calcium, and without sufficient magnesium, the excess calcium is not utilized correctly and may actually become toxic, causing painful conditions in the body.

Many researchers and nutritionists believe magnesium is more important than calcium in order to maintain healthy bones. In addition, magnesium is responsible for more than 300 biochemical reactions, all necessary for optimum health. Magnesium plays a vital role in digestion, energy production, muscle contraction and relaxation, bone formation and cell division. In addition, magnesium is a key nutrient in the proper functioning of the heart, the kidneys, the adrenals and the entire nervous system. 

Most calcium and magnesium supplements contain a ratio of two parts calcium to one part magnesium. The logic behind this ratio is based on the relative amounts of these nutrients used in the body. But in order to determine how much we might need to take as a supplement, we should consider how much of these nutrients we are getting in our food and how they are stored and recycled in the body. For example, the body tends to hold calcium and either store it or recycle it again and again. Magnesium, however, is either used up or excreted and must be replenished on a daily basis. So, even though the daily need for calcium is greater, we are much more likely to become deficient in magnesium."
nutrition,"In normal intakes, saturated fats are very healthy for you and required for various bodily processes. In excess, saturated fats are bad for you (same as anything else).

Some saturated fats (such as medium-chain triglycerides, found in high amounts in both coconut and palm oil) are extremely healthy for you and substantially raise your HDL cholesterol. Some sources of dietary saturated fat are also extremely healthy for you and have a great deal of benefits for various biomarkers of health. Oily fish and coconut oil both contain a substantial amount of saturated fat but are super healthy for you."

nutrition,"I read it. It was a fine thesis. However the answer really is much simpler then that. And you said yourself ""I didn't really answer your question"" These kinds of responses are why people believe it is so hard to find good information and struggle with weight loss. While the chemical process of breaking down different nutrients may be incredibly complicated, this person asked whether sugar or calories led to weight gain. The answer is very simple. Calories. Don't leave them more confused then they started"
nutrition,Am I not allowed to be curious and try to explore and learn? That's kinda the point of this post.
nutrition,No idea what's she's trying to assert but there's some people who believe you can't burn stored body fat without being in ketosis because your body will preferentially burn carbs and them muscle to get the glocuse it needs. It sounds like she's kind of hinting at this without knowing what she's actually talking about.
nutrition,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""hits"". The eggs provide more nutrients and satiety. If you ate 500 cal worth of skittles you would probably feel worse and get hungry sooner, leading to eating more. But isolated from everything else, yes 500 cal is 500 cal and will have the same effect on weight."
nutrition,"No.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15615615/

&gt;A limit on the maximum energy transfer rate from the human fat store in hypophagia is deduced from experimental data of underfed subjects maintaining moderate activity levels and is found to have a value of (290+/-25) kJ/kgd. A dietary restriction which exceeds the limited capability of the fat store to compensate for the energy deficiency results in an immediate decrease in the fat free mass (FFM).

* 290 kJ = 69.31 kcals 
* 1 kg = 2.2 lb
* 290 kJ/kg = 31.4 kcals/lb
* 1 lb fat ~ 3,500 kcals 
* 31.4 kcals/lb / 3,500 kcals/lb = 0.89%

This is on a daily basis. If you use the rule of thumb that 1lb fat is equal to ~3,500kcals, your body can contribute ~0.89% of its total stored fat to energy. If you have 60lb fat, you have 210,000 kcals of energy stored as fat and at 31.4 kcals/lb, you could on average contribute ~1,884 kcals to your daily energy needs from fat stores.

The ± values would be 34.2 and 28.8 for the high/low."
nutrition,"I'd like to add to that has been the hypotheses. I am a certified sports nutritionist.
1. Body will burn carbs or fats depending on the type of activity.
2. For everyone this is different cause of height, weight, gender, age and activity level. Along with any ailments or diseases.
3. What I am noticing is that people are talking about maximum amount of fats one can burn in a day while trying to maintain muscle mass. Firstly that's BS. You will burn muscles even if you are very well within the suggested %. Your body is built to take energy from wherever it is convenient. So that's why people say you need to workout efficiently.
4. Keeping that in mind if you goal is to maintain muscle then you have to lift weights with a respectable amount of volume that basically takes up energy which is readily available so that will be your carbs and protein from your muscles.
5. How to help reduce this is by feeding your body with enough protein and also refilling your carb storage pre and post workout.
6. Where does fat burn in all of this? It is a combination of caloric deficit and sendentry activities which will make the body take energy from fats. Even post your gym routine you will take up energy from fats because you're mostly sendentry and fats is the ideal source of energy during such activity level."
nutrition,I have seen these spam ads on multiple subreddits this week.
nutrition,“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence”. There are also anti-vax MD’s so why care about everything any professional has to say.
nutrition,"&gt;I hope that you seek out an MD position and try this new theories out on some people with diabetes. 

These ""new theories"" have already been tried on people with diabetes; there is good clinical evidence that both keto and VLC diets provide superior performance. I'll provide the studies if you agree to read them. 

&gt;I think that people with diabetes should have a normal life and not a life that they cannot enjoy because they need to be on a VLCD diet.

I'm not sure how you define ""a normal life"", but the reality is that the pharmaceutical treatments for type II diabetes are not very effective; they help a bit but most type II diabetes end up on injectable insulin and the long term prognosis is not good; their life expectancy is about 10 years less and there are a lot of very unpleasant complications to long-term diabetes and long-term obesity.

I'm not personally an advocate for VLCD because they are hard to follow. Keto diets are also hard to follow, but the real question is whether you want to be healthy as you grow old or not. The ""eat what you want"" diet just isn't going to get you there."

It's got a lot of carbs, which can be good if that's what you're going for, and you can use it in place of buttermilk for things like biscuits and pancakes. But it's lower in protein than sweet whey from cheese making."
nutrition,"Never heard it referred to as 
Acid Whey before; sounds so nefarious! A lot of people consider whey to be liquid gold from a health standpoint.

Maybe chobani starts lesser fat milk despite the whole milk title.

nutrition,"I used to work on a brunch restaurant, the type of healthy/organic food, my favorite meal was the ""requeson sandwich"" (sorry I'm mexican, but requeson is basically cottage cheese). It tastes like glory but is also super easy to do, that's why I love it.

You put the cheese in both pieces of bread (like you'd usually do with mayonnaise but on a thicker layer), add a bit of sal and pepper to the cheese and then you put spinach, lettuce, tomato, onion and cucumber. 

One customer used to ask me to add some carrot instead of onion, taste very good as well.

People also loved the apple salad. Here, you just mix everything:
Lettuce,
Spinach,
Red and green apple,
Goat cheese (or cottage cheese for those who felt awkward with goat cheese),
Toasted nuts and peanut,
We had a tamarind dressing but unfortunately I don't know the recipe, yet know there's a few of this in the super market and the flavor is not so different, so I suggest to get one of those."
nutrition,"Raw Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) with the Mother works really good for increasing HCL and can help you digest protein better. It will allow protein-digesting pre-enzymes to transform into their active form. If you have low HCL you should also consider some other things that may contribute to your problem. For example, *H. Pylori* (Helicobacter pylori), the bacteria that causes ulcers, can also cause low stomach acid. There are tests and treatments you can take that can help you pinpoint if you have it. Btw low stomach acid / HCL is one of the root causes of GERD."
nutrition,"Thanks, I really appreciate it!

The biggest change was more structure. I went from drinking beer and eating garbage in college to moving to a HCOL area where I had to learn how to cook or my money would be non-existent haha

I started meal prepping more to save money/time than losing weight but the portions were smaller and the pounds started shedding off. I started making small incremental changes to my lifestyle b/c seeing the scale getting lower was amazing and it made me realize that I don't need to be a fat person for the rest of my life! Life got easier, doing physical things was less painful and less sweaty, and the confidence skyrocketed. The changes were small at first, like adding a little cardio to my lifting routine, drinking vodka sodas instead of beers to get tipsy, limiting fast food to the weekends, eating more greens, etc. Now, I'm running 20-40 miles a week, have a strict lifting routine, and my diet is pretty controlled with the cheat meals I save for seeing friends or dates! But I want to emphasize that the small changes were key; if I were to go from my senior year of college lifestyle to where I am now, I would give up in 1-week tops"
nutrition,"Agreed. Same way I don't leave piles of cocaine lying around on my counters. Sooner or later, I'm gonna consume it, just like the oreos."
nutrition,"She's probably just referring to the fact that in a caloric deficit the body will also start to preferentially burn muscle, not just small amounts of fat - because holding muscle mass is very metabolically costly. This is of course a gross simplification on her part, since these ratios will vary greatly based on levels of anabolic hormones, and environmental stresses like lifting weights."
nutrition,"Sugar is a great way to end up with insulin resistance because of the effect of fructose, and insulin resistance is a great way to gain weight because insulin down-regulates fat burning.

It certainly is true that high-sugar foods tend to drive more intake because carbohydrates are not satiating after about 2 hours, and because processed food is designed to encourage as much intake as possible."
nutrition,"Yes. According to Wikipedia ""*Even after marked weight loss, the body never loses adipocytes. As a rule, to facilitate changes in weight, the adipocytes in the body merely gain or lose fat content. However, if the adipocytes in the body reach their maximum capacity of fat, they may replicate to allow additional fat storage.""*

This phenomenon may sadden a lot of people but it's actually a survival mechanism by our bodies. When you are starving to death those fat stores can buy you extra time until you can find something to eat."
nutrition,Dude that's awesome! Can I ask what moved you to make such a great change in your life?
nutrition,"I feel this and love it! I lost around 90+ lbs or 40+ kg a couple of years ago and my family is shocked about how much I eat now and maintain my weight. They are all convinced I eat more now than when I was 260 lbs. Obviously the food is healthier and I work out more, but my TDEE has increased and I'm loving it. I eat 3000cals a day to maintain at 172 lbs or 78 kg! Good job, brother."

nutrition,"I'm aiming to become a dietitian, but I'm not one yet, so someone else would be able to answer this question better than I would.

From what I understand, there's no ""switch."" It comes down to the efficiency at which the body is able to burn fat. Your body can only burn so much fat per hour, so too great a deficit forces the body to break down muscle tissue as well.

There are other factors that impact this as well, such as testosterone levels, muscle usage, and protein intake. There's more nuance to it, but in a nutshell, losing fat while maintaining muscle requires complete workouts, high protein intake, and a moderate caloric deficit."
nutrition,"Is almond milk from the supermarket overrated in terms of nutrition, e.g. from brands like [Moola](milk/products/unsweetened-almondmilk)? My understanding is that most if not all commercially-sold almond milk includes only a handful (if even that much) of almonds to produce. Perhaps most of the health benefits come from the pulp that is filtered out.

 I know to avoid gums, preservatives, and ""natural flavors.""

Often times, foods are advertised as ""really healthy"" when they might only be a healthier alternative to something else."
nutrition,"It's science. If you take in more calories than you burn, you will gain weight. Don't complicate it"
nutrition,"Is honey simply a healthier sugar alternative or can it actually be healthy on its own? I don't cook with sugar at all (not a self-imposed rule, I just don't eat much sweet things). Wondering if I should add a bit of honey (unfiltered, the real stuff) to my warm teas just for the sake of health benefits.

I believe those health benefits are apparently too insignificant to have any positive impact."
nutrition,TL;DR Eating more calories than you burn causes weight gain.
nutrition,I did say it makes sense as a last resort. But I don't understand why it would happen if there's still fat to burn
nutrition,"Don't make it more complicated than it needs to be. Calories in, calories out. In regards to weight gain or loss, it's that simple."
nutrition,Ooooh I think someone was trying to explain that in the comments. Thank you!
nutrition,"She may have those references, but I only know two tik tokers that consistently list references in videos. I gave her 2 days to respond with references and she hasn't. 

I was giving her the benefit of doubt."
nutrition,"I’m thinking what she is referring to is the glycerol backbone of triglycerides which can be converted into glucose and accounts for 5-10% of the triglyceride weight. This would be a completely nonsensical argument on her behalf though, because we can get fuel from things other than glucose."
nutrition,"It does make sense for a last resort. Especially if you don't supply the body with enough calories and all your stored fat has been reduced to substantial amount. If you are not using your muscle, your body will use your muscle mass and eventually move on to your organs as the last resort."
nutrition,Oversimplified but your body can’t get the amino acids it needs from glucose or fat.
nutrition,Is it realistically feasible for someone to get an excessive amount of any of the fat-soluble nutrients through food alone?
nutrition,If she doesn't have any references than why are you listening to her?  It's probably all hearsay.
nutrition,A taste issue
nutrition,"thank you so much for taking the time to answer like that ! Yeah it does make sense that saturated fat is better than refined carbs, but if you can avoid both..."
nutrition,"No, I’d say that is usually not the case. Bulking is used by bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts alike to allow their bodies more fuel to grow more muscle mass. They will most certainly be less lean when bulking in comparison to while running a cut, but the main idea of bulking is that you’re simultaneously working your muscles extra hard so that you are using most of the extra calories consumed. Bulking, when done correctly is also usually focused around healthy foods that are not going to turn straight into fat, and therefore bodybuilders tend to aim for what is called a “lean bulk”. There are many other factors involved, but that is the main idea."
nutrition,"This is a good explanation, thanks.  I took the slow approach, and still lost some muscle on my way to getting to my GW.   But I was able to get it back and maintain once I got there, which took around two years."
nutrition,What don’t you like about other veggies? Is this a taste vs. texture issue?
nutrition,Being accurate would have meant losing ad revenue and viewers? Usually the reason that science is misrepresented.
nutrition,"Just recall- science is not whatever any random person claiming credentials and expertise on the internet says.  Science is peer reviewed, long process of converging lines of evidence studies.  So its nice when we can find legitimate advice from actual experts, and trust them to synthesize all that literature and data.  But...its hard to find in all the noise of influencers, and fake scientists, and people with the training and education but dump all that for $$$ from all those sweet sweet ads. More than ever, online advice should be taken with a huge dose of skepticism."

nutrition,"This is basically just a question of what comes first: obesity (CICO) or metabolic syndrome (insulin).

**CICO**  
In other words, you get fat because you eat too much and develop insulin resistance and probably other related metabolic conditions like hypertension, high cholesterol, and endocrine dysfunction.

**Insulin**  
Your diet and lifestyle is poor so you develop insulin resistance which leads to obesity and the other metabolic conditions.

Am I correct in my understanding of these models?"
nutrition,"&gt; many people don't get accurate calculations of their body fat

The only people who get are lying on the corener

There's no reliable way to measure BF% without opening someone up, and most people under-underestimated how much they have, this redditor for example would have won any competition if he managed that because it's unheard of in the bodybuilding community."
nutrition,"It sounds more like desperation moves rather than wise, practical solutions to a child's weight gain.

For the first 10 years or so, what a kid eats is almost 100% under the control of the parents. If they get their kid hooked on fatty sugary foods, that's on them. If they then continue to have that stuff in the freezer at all, that's on them.

There's no question that obesity has run rampant in the US recently b/c of food choices. There's always an underlying genetic propensity in some families, but they never had these issues 100 years ago, for example.

This reminds me of in-laws who have a tremendously obese dog. They literally tell me ""we buy low-calorie dog food, don't let her snack much, we just don't know what to do."" and it blows my mind. What your dog eats is **100%** in your control, just feed it slightly less than its caloric needs until its at a good weight, and then feed it exactly its caloric needs from then on.

It's basically as simple as that with a child. Don't have crap in the house in the first place, instill healthy eating habits from the get-go, and in the vast majority of cases, you will not have an obese child."
nutrition,Oh I have a whole other rant for soda hahah

nutrition,"Sure, bruh"
nutrition,"In all fairness, Tik Tok videos like this have been great springboards for tons of other concepts and theories I've researched.  Usually these concepts are based in some grain of truth, and that's what I am seeking to find, if there is one."
nutrition,"You're misunderstanding.

If you gain enough weight, you can double or even quadruple the **number** of fat cells in your body.

If you lose weight, you can *shrink* the fat cells significantly, but you can never decrease the number of fat cells."
nutrition,"The biggest offender in my opinion is soda.  I gave that up young because it upset my stomach, but I’ve seen people guzzle that crap down so much and wonder why they gain weight. 

I grew up with a decently balanced household. Good dinners. Always had fruit around. But I was known to binge on the occasional full sleeve of Oreos or giant bowl of sugary cereal. Always thin as a a rail. Was told I had the Golden metabolism of the gods. In reality, I was just a super active kid and I don’t feel hunger unless I’m bored so I didn’t eat very much. I’m pretty fit still but being way less active as an adult, I definitely pay more attention to what I eat now and notice the impact on my body when I let loose."
nutrition,"on tik tok, that answers your question."
nutrition,"On the plus side if you grew the fat cells as a boy they probably grew all over in different spots on your body. You can now store fat there as an adult male. If you had been a fat free adolescent you could now only grow fat on you abdomen and that spare tire, causing a more pronounced pot belly on sticks kind of a look. I'm thankful for my adolescent fat phase. Now if I fluctuate no one can tell (until it really gets out of hand.)"
nutrition,"I also believe that tracking exercise is bull. All the devices tracking are usually way over evaluating what you are doing. Like going for a light jog = 700 calories ... I mean comm on!

nutrition,Yes. I cycle many many miles everyday
nutrition,"Agreed on all counts. I'm not going to speak for anyone else, but reading accounts from other people, my experience seems pretty common. 

I personally think it has nothing to do with ""plant dodging"" but is the absence of processed / refined foods. Hunter gatherer societies across the globe had marked differences in what they ate. That being said it was all unprocessed foods - and we see very low to no incidence of the ""diseases of civilisation"" in those cultures until they were introduced to the wonders of alcohol, tobacco and processed foods."
nutrition,"I'm reading that 8-20% is ""healthy"" or ""normal"" [whatever that means].  And that 3% is considered the bare minimum safe % and that is usually only found in endurance athletes and bodybuilders.  Are you sure you have an accurate measurement? At 2% you should be able to see striations (spelling?) which is the definition of each tiny muscle fiber.  Not judging or acussing you of being wrong I'm just surprised at the number."
nutrition,Some junk food (think McDonald’s) is best not enjoyed at all. There really isn’t a correct way to enjoy it.
nutrition,"Just heads up, but 800 calories of exercise is really a lot. 

Go outside now and try to jog 8 miles. It will likely take you 1 hour and half or even two hours +. 

8 miles jogging burns 800 calories. Jogging is probably the most efficient way of burning calories. HIIT is really overrated and if you do it correct, then you can only do it say 2x a week.

I feel people go on an exercise bike for twenty minute look at the display and it says they burned 800 calories. In reality they probably only burned 100 calories. Or they go from the apple watch calories burned calculation, but the apple watch is just seeing this human has a high heart rate so is burning a lot of calories when it more that the average human is unfit.

Also, as someone who burns on average an extra 800 - 1,100 calories a day by jogging 1-2 hours a day. It would be easier to just eat less calories. 

For example, how much vegetables are you eating? I eat 300 grams minimum a day."
nutrition,True. They flatten when you lose weight.
nutrition,"That's the way to do it! Keep in mind that having some adipose tissue is normal, healthy and necessary. Ironically, men who have an unhealthily low body fat percentage are more prone to cardiac issues, can experience plummeting testosterone, your bones can become brittle, it can begin to affect your strength and workouts, etc. Take care and congrats on feeling good!"
nutrition,"It might be a reference to the daily supply of fat that fat storing cells can provide.  Like, if you have 100lb of fat on you, that means around 350 000 calories you can have access to. Does that mean that you can access all of that energy at once? Of course not, there is a rate at which fat cells can release fatty acids back into the circulation to be consumed by other tissue. This sounds reasonable, but the thing is, there are no definite measurements of how many calories can you access from your stores in a given day. Some say no more than 1000 calories, other say different numbers, but none of that is conclusive."
nutrition,Thanks I did not know seeds and nuts were not the same thing!  I did some research I will be looking to try these out!  Thanks again!
nutrition,"There are a lot of people with all the qualifications but who aren't helpful. Not to mention there's a huge market for advice that's ""body positive"" but not entirely factual."
nutrition,"Oh yes, I think you can get plenty of protein using whole food sources. Btw, it’s helpful to use a coffee grinder to grind up the flax or chia seed just before adding it to a smoothie. Makes for a more pleasant smoothie consistency."
nutrition,"I'll be honest, I assumed you fall into this group lol. But I don't want to assume so may I ask what method you rely on for measuring your body fat %.  I hear there are several and they can all yield varying results."
nutrition,"I'm sure this may not apply to everyone but I don't track my exercise and I don't think it's efficient to do so. I've always heard and read online that exercise calories are way too inaccurate to be able to accurately track how many calories you are truly burning.  I just track my calories consumed and adjust accordingly. But that's just me and my job is very physically demanding so I have a much greater margin for error than many others I must admit.

Best of luck."

nutrition,"Ah, okay in the context of a day that makes more sense...I wish she had been more specific."

nutrition,"&gt;Fat in the bloodstream can build up inside the muscle cell and create toxic fatty breakdown products and free radicals that can block the insulin signaling process. When that happens, no matter how much insulin we have in our blood, it won’t be able to open the glucose gates. That causes blood sugar levels to build up in the blood.

and yet, despite this far-fetched and suspiciously specific mechanism you are proposing, low-carbohydrate and ketogenic diets are **in the real world** among the most effective protocols for *reversing* diabetes and cases of healthy individuals developing type 2 diabetes under these interventions are unheard of

how would you explain that under this mechanism? either its impact is irrelevant or it's just wrong"
nutrition,Yes it’s somewhere around two percent. Don’t get me wrong I’m getting close to 12st don’t know what that is on kg or pounds so I’m not skinny just not much of any of it is fat
nutrition,I have no idea where the 5% thing comes from. She might be referring to a limited amount of body fat you can lose **per day** before you start breaking down muscle proteins. Lifters who are  cutting weight can't have too steep a caloric deficit because of this. There's no long term limit to how much fat you can lose.
nutrition,"haha, you'd think that would be enough but unfortunately there are still people out there that have ""reasons"" to why that doesn't disprove the theory"
nutrition,"It can be dangerous. But many people don't get accurate calculations of their body fat, so there's the chance it's off."

nutrition,"Depends who you're talking about, really.  If you mean the muscular but lean actors like Ryan Reynolds then for him it's mostly a matter of being able to maintain very low bodyfat% for a short amount of time.  You can guarantee these guys don't actually look like that shirtless 12 months of the year.  If you're talking about guys like Dwayne Johnson or Mark Wahlberg, I'd put my entire paycheck on them being on roids yeah."
nutrition,"Yeah, I'm not sure either --- and I could see the body having some kind of preservation mechanism where maybe it switches on/off between muscle and fat, but, even that didn't make sense when I reviewed body scans from keto-ers. So I'm starting to think this might just be trash ."
nutrition,"Congratulations! And I appreciate you responding. Yeah that's kind of along the lines I was thinking. I've spent about 10 hours since this video came out trying to find ANYTHING on it, and it's coming up short, Big time."
nutrition,"Wait, what?  Your body composition is less than 5% body fat? I heard that's dangerous and the body needs some fat for proper function. Am I mistaken?"
nutrition,"I just finished school to be an RD, haven’t sat for my boards or done my internship yet, and I have never heard this. When you lose weight, you will lose a mix of fat and muscle so it’s good to do some resistance training to rebuild the muscles. The 5% can’t be true, because then people wouldn’t be able to lose massive amounts of weight, and they totally can. Hopefully this makes sense, I am just waking up and need coffee, lol."
nutrition,"Yes, but for all practical reasons that’s not relevant to losing weight, and keeping it off. Having those fat cells already in existence does make it a little, and I do mean a “little” easier to put the weight back on. It doesn’t make it dramatically different though. If you drop the weight, and change your eating habits to fit your new calorie maintenance level for your new weight, you’ll be fine."
nutrition,"We evolved adipose tissue to supply extra energy, among other things, during a deficit. 

Maybe she’s saying after 5% of your body fat is burned, your body dips into muscle tissue to supply glucose? I’m not sure. 

Our bodies thrive on fat, so perhaps it’s just another archaic relic of 60’s-70’s nutritional education."
nutrition,I appreciate anyone who takes the time to  comment &lt;3
nutrition,Couldn’t you say anyone who loses weight while having higher insulin disproves the insulin model of obesity?
nutrition,"No I wouldn't say that. 

Saturated fats are an essential part of the diet. They are used in hormone production and are needed to facilitate absorption of fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Vitamin D specifically is needed for healthy immune function. Low vitamin D levels are often associated with autoimmunity and increased susceptibility to infection. 

As with anything moderation is key. Meats and saturated fats have been associated with inflammation and and obesity because often these individuals are eating too much. That combined with their other lifestyle factors leads to high inflammation markers."
nutrition,Calories. The issue is many excess calories in peoples diets are coming from sugar. The answer is literally as simple as this. Anyone telling you it’s sugar and not excess calories probably has some sort of agenda.
nutrition,"True ... i do realize that by doing 800 calories worth of exercise would help me a lot better than 300. Hitting micros is not an issue for me ... i am an (not certified) nutrient optimizer, i have targets way higher than RDIs .. and i do meet 95% of them daily with ease (for me) and with deficit. So for losing weight it should be no difference between 1 and 3.. but some differences must be.. hence the question here on reddit"
nutrition,I'm not your pal guy!
nutrition,Sorry I can’t help prolly shouldn’t have left a comment. I’m defo not a fitness guy just spent all of Covid getting healthy and haven’t seen anything about a limit on fat reduction. Due to biological reasons
nutrition,"I am eating about 2g/Kg BW/daily of protein. My goal is to lose weight so i increased the share of protein in order to help me with my satiety. I reach all DRI for all vitamins, minerals, essential fat and aminoacids (for most of them i even go to 200-300%). I don't want to lose weight at the expanse of my health so micros are top priority. I managed to lose weight so far (a lot) ...but i know that my current deficit (not eating) will no longer be able to do it's job .. as the leaner i get through not eating the more my BMR will also drop. So at some point i will have 2 choices; not eat more (going even less with my calories in) or start doing exercises. I am not really fond of them (I know .. .I know... i have to) so that's why i am wondering how would it affect me going with example 1 or 3. You already gave me an answer...i did not consider body recomposition."
nutrition,"Well, duh, I know that. But a lot of times what happens is people take a known concept and either blow it out of proportion or cherry pick it to fit their specific agenda. 

I'm trying to find the roots of where this might have come from and understand the real facts behind it, if any."
nutrition,"Well yeah, I know that, but I'm trying to find where this whole 5% number came from, and the ""science"" behind it, if any."
nutrition,I didn’t see it but I’ll tell you now I have less than 5% body fat right now it’s around 2% the rest is muscle and I know that there are ppl with less than me so if you have 60lb of body fat then u can burn almost all of it off. Don’t get me wrong not saying you should but it defo can be do e
nutrition,"""Obesity is increasing in an epidemic manner in most countries and constitutes a public health problem by enhancing the risk for cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. Owing to the increase in obesity, life expectancy may start to decrease in developed countries for the first time in recent history. The factors determining fat mass in adult humans are not fully understood, but increased lipid storage in already developed fat cells (adipocytes) is thought to be most important. Here we show that adipocyte number is a major determinant for the fat mass in adults. However, the number of fat cells stays constant in adulthood in lean and obese individuals, even after marked weight loss, indicating that the number of adipocytes is set during childhood and adolescence. To establish the dynamics within the stable population of adipocytes in adults, we have measured adipocyte turnover by analysing the integration of 14C derived from nuclear bomb tests in genomic DNA. Approximately 10% of fat cells are renewed annually at all adult ages and levels of body mass index. Neither adipocyte death nor generation rate is altered in early onset obesity, suggesting a tight regulation of fat cell number in this condition during adulthood. The high turnover of adipocytes establishes a new therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention in obesity.""

nutrition,"In terms of weight, a calorie deficit will cause weight loss regardless.

Option 3 might be a slightly better option health wise based on more exercise and more food(hitting your micros)."
nutrition,"I've done both so putting in my unsolicited opinion, sorry.

Maybe this isn't the norm but internet is filled with the same story. My coolsculpting was more painful than what the doctor said it will be. I went there and was given pain meds first thing, then told to eat a sandwich because the pain will cause low blood sugar. I was surprised but didn't think much. I had paid for 5 cycles and after the first one I wouldn't have done the second if I hadn't already paid. Afterwards I was in so much pain that I could barely walk to the car. The waist swole from 32 to 46, and the pain was indescribable. That night I needed to pee and on my way back from the loo I fainted from pain. Swelling remained bad for 7-10 days, and the pain for 3 weeks. The results were visible and impressive but not worth it.

I got liposuction some time back, a massive surgery. They took 6.5 litres which is a bit more than normal outpatient surgery. The side effects from anaesthesia were bad that day but subsided the next day. I was in pain but able To bare it much easier. I needed help getting up for 2-3 days since it was a 360 lipo with full abdomen full back and sides. On the day 4-5 I was doing little chores in the kitchen, able to take stairs slowly, and basically feeling well altogether. On day 7th I went for a dinner as the pain had fully subsided. The swelling took a month to subside and the results were so freaking amazing.

If I had to do it all over again I'll surely pick lipo over coolsculpting. As for the price, I picked the top places in my country for both and the lipo was cheaper even including the laser tightening, for coolsculpting I not only paid more but also had to shell for tightening so lipo was 60% the cost I spent on coolsculpting."
nutrition,"In terms of fat loss, cico is the basic rule. In theory, your examples make sense to an extent, but in application, very difficult. So example 1 is a calorie deficit, makes sense, as well as example 2, calorie surplus. Example 3 is a little bit harder to explain because there is no way to *accurately* track the amount of calories you're burning. I think example 3 would be closest to a body recomposition (assuming the exercise is resistance training) so that you're eating in surplus, and you're using those calories to build muscle. You may lean out in this muscle building process. 

The other thing that is a big factor in these examples are macros. Your macros will affect your body composition. You want to make sure you are getting enough protein to help your body recover and reserve (not sure if that's the right word) your muscle. The type of exercise you are doing is also important in your goal. If you are burning x amount of calories through cardio, even if your goal is fatloss, you may not look ""toned"" if you do not have muscle, giving you the skinny fat look. 

Then the last category, micronutrients. Theoretically, as long as you are CICO, you can eat whatever you want and gain/lose weight. As long as you eat within your macros, you should be able to have the body composition you want. Something to keep in mind os the quality of foods you consume. Can you eat only McDonald's and poptarts and lose weight? Sure, but you'll probably feel like trash. Micros are important more with how you feel, so remember to eat veggies and less processed foods when you can."
nutrition,"Well I eat mostly and often only meat, so let's see how your knowledge of epidemiology squares with my practical experience over the last 2.5 years. 

&gt;Meat Elevates Levels of C-Reactive Protein 

False. My C-Reactive Protein is 0.4. All my other inflammatory markers are low. 

&gt;Meat Causes Insulin Resistance 

False. My fasting insulin is 4, and I'm in ketosis, which requires low insulin. I was previously pre-diabetic (skin tags, high fasting insulin) which rapidly reversed in about 3 months on a meat heavy diet. If you want to claim meat causes insulin resistance, explain how I reversed mine with a meat heavy diet. 

&gt;Meat Raises Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 

False. The clue is in the name. Insulin stimulates hepatic IGF-1 synthesis. My fasting insulin is low as previously mentioned. Fat stimulates no insulin and protein has a minimal effect on insulin in the absence of carbohydrate. This should not be a surprise to anyone who engages in a little critical thinking on this matter. 

&gt;Meat Produces Trimethylamine-N-Oxide 

False. I had a microbiome test along with my (vegan) boss. Incidentally I had higher microbial diversity and a higher health score than my boss in that test. The researchers were keen to check my trimethylamine levels. They were surprised when it was normal. 

&gt;Meat Can Lead to Accumulations of Persistent Organic Pollutants 

So don't eat farmed fish and chicken/pork, animals highly exposed to our polluted crop residues. Animals biomagnify and bioaccumlate nutrients and toxins alike. Specialist herbivores like sheep and cows living most of their lives on pasture can extract significant nutrition efficiently which they pass on to me. Hence my intake of Vitamins A, D, E, K2, critical for good health, are very good. And of course, we already know meat contains all essential amino acids and fatty acids. 

&gt;Meat Contains Advanced Glycation End-Products 

Like all cooked foods. Don't cook in high heat - I don't. What mitigates this? Antioxidants. Like glutathione, the king of antioxidants, which we make endogenously from complete proteins. Or carnitine, taurine and carnosine, highly potent antioxidants abundant in meat."

Neither has been 100% proven or disproven but to me one seems much more likely and that is the CICO model of obesity. It makes much more sense logically and is more widely supported by experts. When looking for studies on the topic I found these:

For CICO model:

If you’re a former alcoholic, drug user, or smoker, you’re going to have a hard time resisting that stuff (and have the physical tissue scars on your lungs etc), than someone who never started, but it’s not impossible.

The same can be said for mental issues caused by various forms of abuse, war, rape, crime, porn, adultery, hookups etc. It’s totally possible to come back from that stuff, but your brain has been influenced by it. You’ll never be 100% what you would have been if it never happened. The good thing about reformed people is they can say “look kid, you do NOT want to make the same mistakes I made. So stop while you’re ahead.” The bad ones just continue to indulge in it because it’s “too late to change” excuse and they pass that behavior on to others, mainly their kids."

I think it's pretty likely that excessive fructose causes NAFLD - see the papers in the search [here](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C48&amp;q=nafld+causes+fructose&amp;btnG=). 

Fructose metabolism is well understood, and it's very easy for fructose to result in de novo lipogenesis in the liver when the fructose is eaten along with glucose, as it generally is. There are theories that the ability of humans to convert fructose to fat [was a survival benefit earlier in our evolutionary history](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/joim.12993?utm_source=mp-fotoscapes). 

It's also well documented that NAFLD causes disregulation of gluconeogenesis ([reference](https://www.cmghjournal.org/article/S2352-345X\(18\)30162-0/fulltext)). That causes a chronic supply of extra glucose coming into the bloodstream, which causes chronic elevated insulin (hyperinsulinemia). 

One of the commonly used measures of insulin resistance in research is HOMA-IR, which is based on fasting glucose and fasting insulin, so it's a measure of both hyperinsulinemia and elevated fasting glucose. It correlates well with the gold standard for insulin resistance, the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. 

From that point, it's a short journey to more problems; the elevated insulin makes it hard to burn fat, which bumps up triglycerides and makes the liver fat worse. The constant supply of glucose means that glycogen stores are rarely depleted, which shows up as carbohydrate intolerance and larger and longer blood glucose spikes when carbs are eaten. 

If this is true, we would expect that diets that can resolve the hyperinsulinemia would be effective against type II, and other diets would not be effective. Which is exactly what we do see; conventional diets take people who are diabetic and make them a little less diabetic. Very low calorie (&lt;800 cal/day) diets and keto diets address the hyperinsulinemia and provide superior performance against type II. Fasting likely does as well, though there are fewer clinical trials with fasting. 

&gt; With type 2 diabetes, the answer is a little more complex. Though we know sugar doesn’t directly cause type 2 diabetes, you are more likely to get it if you are overweight. You gain weight when you take in more calories than your body needs, and sugary foods and drinks contain a lot of calories.

Why should I give credence to the view of an organization that does not provide effective treatment for type II diabetics? The standard treatment that they propose is a low-fat moderate-carb diet along with diabetes medication and injected insulin as the condition worsens."
nutrition,"Ooh yes that sounds like what I ate today haha! (Actually my lunch everyday 😅)Hemp seeds are my go to! Great superfood and worth the price! 
 I eat wraps everyday, with humus, avocado, chipotle powder, broccoli, and caramelized mushroom+onion, and kalamata olive. It’s the BEST, especially if you toast the wrap it in a skillet. 

Yeah, thanks to this thread , I realized 
I’m not eating enough calories so I’m going to double up my meal prep. Once I’m eating a surplus, then I’ll look again at the protein. 
Thank you! 
I will try out protein squares, I haven’t made those before! And absolutely, back to basics I should go back to eating lots of oatmeal, I’ve been overlooking the basics! Do u have any recipe recommendations for the protein bites?"

Keep eating oats every morning too, they are good for your health."
nutrition,"I’m biased, I’m plant-based. But I would encourage you to reconsider and omit the eggs. Just keep eating clean, protein-rich plants. Here are some ideas to up your protein intake: Use coconut flour + nut butter when making energy squares. Add a generous portion of hulled hemp seed to your smoothies, oatmeal, salads. Make hummus and omit the low quality oil, put it in a veggie wrap with quinoa and broccoli. There are so many protein-rich plant foods, and so many ways to prepare them."

We're all still morbidly obese even though I've been out of that house for over a decade and my siblings for even longer. Making good progress since 2018, but the psychological side of obesity is hard to get control of. It's not just the exposure to the bad food, it's the exposure to the unhealthy coping mechanisms as a child that make it so hard to break out of it as an adult."

No matter how hard I go on a diet/workout streak, all other parts of body lose/gain fat and muscle but the waistline just seems to be set in ~~fat~~ stone."

nutrition,"I guess that when the serious loss started, i wasn't 113kg (which was my highest mark that I recall) as I stated in another comment but was already around 100kg. so basically I worked out a lot, around 3hs per day of gym+cardio+swimming; and dieting, all combined resulted in around 20kg loss in 3 months (I know that it wasn't a good plan to lose as much in that short time, but I wasn't expecting such results, neither was my nutritionist) anyways, I have loose skin but it's almost unnoticeable.
And to maintain the loss... I didn't do much, as I said I don't need to have a good diet anymore (although now i'd prefer eating healthy 100% but it takes time and resources), i kept working out, because I enjoy it and fell in love with the process of being able to build my body, though not nearly as much as i did in the past: some running from time to time, and a bit of calisthenics."
nutrition,"Animal fat is generally high in saturated fat, which raises LDL, a casual factor for heart disease. Generally, just because something has a long tradition does not mean it's optimal for health."
nutrition,"The point is that if it's set in adolescence, a lot of us did not magically pull ourself up by our diet bootstraps before we graduated high school even if we later managed to lose the weight. Hopefully you just didn't read what they were saying and aren't actually blaming people for not teaching themselves about calories and cooking their own healthy food before they were even legally able to have a job."
nutrition,"When I'm talking about how someone was raised I am obviously referring to childhood. Even if mommy and daddy still feed their 30 year old, it is clearly irrelevant to my argument. Full grown adults blaming someone else for their issues is a whole different story.
I took responsibility at 14 and kept the weight off despite being fed dinners slathered in butter. My two siblings and I were all overweight by the age of 5. My dad wasn't fat until he started living with my mom. This is a common occurence. Children shouldn't take responsibility for their own health, weight, food choices or exercise. When they're forced to, it easily goes south. My entire family has some sort of disordered eating or a full blown eating disorder."

nutrition,This only makes it worse. A lot of us grew up fat because of how we were raised.
nutrition,"This isn’t a cut and dry answer. Simply because experiments are difficult: accurate specific cell counts in a living specimen, time, lack of a perfect control, health conditions, genetics, etc.

We will be working on and developing an accurate answer for decades if not longer. “Googling” gives simple answers, but in reality there is much more nuance. And maybe you missed it but I did reference where I learned the information. It wasn’t on a forum,or a clickbait website, or any other .com. It wasn’t from a coach or a friend.

nutrition,The set point theory is about your body wanting to stay a certain weight and doing its best to do that. You can reset your set point by either gaining or losing weight and maintaining that for a few years.
nutrition,"First of all, fiber might be the most lacking nutrient in the developed world, and its importance to health cannot be easily overstated.  More importantly, defining fruit by two or three components is careless and unscientific.  There is synergy in whole plant foods, part of why we cannot be healthy living on olive oil and a multivitamin.  
 
Fruit-deficient diets account for many life years lost globally.  Feel free to look that up, if you care to."
nutrition,"I think the fat cells can be lysed, and release their contents, but the cell still remains and it can be re-filled up again."
nutrition,"With few exceptions, skeletal muscle cells are terminally differentiated and do not divide (hyperplasia). They will increase the number of intracellular sarcomeres through hypertrophy, which will increase strength and size of individual myocytes. These adapatations are induced by stress and must be sustained by continued stress (e.g. exercise)."
nutrition,"Sorry for your loss. Yeah, I dont remember a ton in regards to the nitty gritty from my certified fitness trainer certification, but I do remember that. Most people don't ask stuff like that before training. Stay well"
nutrition,I think you don't know what the set point theory is all about.
nutrition,"Let me walk you off the ledge a little: why does any of this matter to you? The exact biological mechanisms that is? If you want to lose weight, and keep that weight of, you can. Mechanically speaking, outside of \*EXTREMELY\* rare cases, it's trivial - eat at a caloric deficit and you lose weight. Then maintain a calorie neutral diet to maintain weight. 

The biggest problem and most common factor, by a mile, for people to regain lost weight is that the moment they finish their weight loss they just start defaulting to the same calorically excessive and overindulgent diet they had before that caused them to gain weight in the first place.

So change your diet and nutritional habits and your weight and health are guaranteed to change too."
nutrition,Are those level per day? 1.3g/kg/day?
nutrition,"Makes sense! Tbh my mind was kind of blown because I recently realized she was the only person who’d ever explained it this way to me, and I’d just accepted it as true and never asked anyone else! She passed 11 years ago, so thanks for confirming this “momism” and bringing a smile to my face!"

nutrition,"I saw somewhere while I was looking into this that the amount of weight you'd have to gain would be \~60% of your healthy weight to increase your adipocyte numbers. So if your healthy weight is 150, based on this statistic you have to get to 240 from fat accumulation."
nutrition,"I like paleo diet cookbooks - Nom Nom Paleo is my favorite. I’m not really on the paleo diet; I have no fear of gluten for example. But the basic philosophy of using fresh ingredients with as few processing steps involved as possible is really solid. On top of that, Nom Nom does a good job teaching building blocks. Like, instead of hyper focusing on a recipe, it’s about realizing how to combine fundamentals and cook without a recipe. Stuff like balancing fat with acid, and adding fish sauce for umami richness."

nutrition,"&gt;In model 2, in which change in BW was added as a mediator to those variables already present in model 1, after a total protein intake of 1.3 g/kg BW/d was exceeded, the effect on LBM change continued to rise with resistance training and declined without resistance training. 

For the people who do resistance training, do not lower your protein intake to 1.3g/kg LBM 😅"
nutrition,"Thanks for sharing, that is interesting indeed!

nutrition,"Fruit can't really always be judged by price, as that fluctuates wildy based on season and source location, which are the more important factors. 

Local fruit that is currently in season will be abundant, fresh, and cheaper than any alternative. The same fruit, however, can be expensive if bought out of season/imported from another country and there is no guarantee that it will be fully GMO (growing fruit out of season is hard/impossible to do naturally).

So learn what fruit grows near you at what time of the year, and focus on that. If the fruit you like does not grow near you, try to at least match the season with the land it is imported from.

If you don't want to bother, fruit that is on sale is usually in high supply, but that could also mean there's simply low demand so I'd just do my research if you want to be absolutely sure"

nutrition,"Bollocks.
Animal fat has been used for cooking since the utensils and fire been invented. It's normal. There are toxic oils and then not harmful oils. 

Cars are also bad for enviroment? Let's stop using them.
Smartphones too.
Everything is bad."
nutrition,And what does Type 2 diabetes have to do with sugar?
nutrition,It depends on the fish. The wild caught fish near my city is bad and is not really recommended to eat more than a couple of times a year. The farmed fish from our neighbouring country is much better in that regard and can be eaten as per the recommendations of 2-3 times a week. Don't you have any governmental guidelines of what fish to eat or not? It is really hard for Reddit to know if it is safe or not.

nutrition,"I absolutely adore the flavor -- I started out on sugary yogurts, decided to try making my own, slowly reduced my toppings, and now I just prefer it plain, full-fat, with nothing in it. Fage 5% is my favorite of the brands I can usually find. Nancy's Grass-fed is my very favorite though, so far. 😊"
nutrition,"Calories per 100g of substance is not very relevant information. Oats have more calories than ice-cream. That doesn't mean ice-cream is healthier. It's how much calories does it take to satisfy you. 80g of oats can fill you up real good, but 80g of ice cream is nothing. You will almost always eat more than than. Same with greek yogurt. It's very filling."
nutrition,"It depends. And i don't know if there's enough research about GMO vs organic long term benefits. Grains have been crossbreed for decades naturally, is speeding that up or modifying tomatoes with fish or other dna so they don't freeze in the refrigerator healthy? 

Also many large stores pick fruits and vegetables when they're not ripe yet before they're shipped to the stores. They spray them with nitrogen to ripen and look the color they're supposed to be, but that last stage of growth is where all the nutrition comes from. 

If you can't buy local produce, i supplement my nutrition. If you want to talk more about supplements, i can rant there too. 

Local isn't always more expensive. In season produce is also better IMO."
nutrition,"The BBC did a documentary comparing higher priced items such as chia seeds and flax seed and compared them to ordinary fruits such as strawberries and bananas, in terms of the nutritional value each posses. 

Turns out, there’s actually no benefit in opting for the flax seed/chia seed over the ‘ordinary fruit’, it’s just a marketing ploy to get you to spend up to 5 times as much...

Save you more and don’t fall for the marketing BS. My local shop sells both, strawberries are about £1.50 a box, chia seeds are around £4.50..."
nutrition,"Fullness,vitamin a,k2 etc."

nutrition,Do these work the same with meat and vegetables?
nutrition,Woooow that’s incredible!
nutrition,"I would say they’re equally healthy 
 
They might have different nutritional value( amount of sugar,fibers,vitamins and antioxidants)  but they’re pretty much the same.

Absolutely not worth it for the nutrition alone."
nutrition,"Protein intake suggestions are usually related to lean mass if you are a bit overweight. 

But if you are trying to target increasing lean mass and decreasing fat mass, you should probably prioritize protein anyway, since it is also satiating, making it easier to eat less in general but also giving your body the materials to add muscle. I'd suggest aiming for 160 - 200g of protein per day (1.2 - 1.6g/kg). In conjunction with that, decrease either fat OR carbohydrate (but not both) for the rest of your calories. 

So you could go the bodybuilder diet route - lean chicken breast + rice &amp; broccoli type meals. OR you could try a low carb diet targeting 1.2 - 1.6g/kg protein per day, where the rest of the calories come from fat, but only to the extent that you require them to satisfy your hunger. 

Whatever you ultimately choose, the main thing to consider is how well can you stick to it in the medium to long term."
nutrition,"Agreed. I'm a regular consumer of low fat greek yoghurt with some combination of protein powder/cinnamon/all spice/sweetener and some mixed berries - absolutely delicious, whilst also being incredibly nutritious and relatively low calorie too."
nutrition,"It’s 600.

EPA and DHA are both different types of omega-3.
I assume the 2000mg is the fish oil itself."
nutrition,thanks!
nutrition,"unfortunately this is seen in animals and egg production too. Animal feed can contain the same problematic components which are accumulated in fat and muscle tissue then, or the egg yolk."
nutrition,Use brown rice! I say it’s healthy in comparison to other foods. Fried rice over drive through.
nutrition,"Sorry, wasn't trying to tell you what to do. That's a valid reason to use fat free yogurt.

I'm just aware that a lot of people think it's ""healthier"" because there's no fat, which isn't inherently the case. Carry on, and good luck!"
nutrition,"Interesting!! Is this process seen in chicken, pork, or beef? Does a fish’s aquatic biology make it more apt to absorb and store these toxins?"
nutrition,"Thanks, but I know what I'm doing though. I find fat free yogurt more convenient because I don't plan my day's diet in advance, so I prefer pretty ""pure macro"" foods - very lean protein sources, straight fats, etc. I have nothing against full fat yogurt."
nutrition,"One of the biggest problems is the fish food. The fish is only so healthy as it’s  food. 
Fish turned into fish food comes almost exclusively from the sea and is very often heavily poisoned by chemicals like dioxin, heavy metals and also microplastic. The plant feed fir fish comes from monocultures that have been intensively 'treated' with pesticides, so this poisonous cocktail also ends up in fish feed.
Besides,  there is the point of poisonous feed additives: 
Ethoxyquin, which is very widely used as a fish feed additive, is extremely problematic. It prevents fishmeal from going rancid. Originally it was used as a 'plant protection product'. Farmers in the EU have not been allowed to use it since 2011 - because of its presumed toxicity in very low doses. Absurdly, however, it can still be added to animal feed. This is despite the fact that substances may only be used in the EU if it can be proven that they do not cause any damage. Studies show, however, that ethoxyquin resp. whose breakdown product is very likely carcinogenic and can even get into the brain. This finding is particularly worrying for pregnant women, because the brain of an unborn child is extremely sensitive to pollutants. 
I do not trust any farmed or wild caught fish anymore when it comes to their chemical load so I have stopped eating fish."
nutrition,Maybe it’s been too long since you last ate before your workout? You could have a carby snack about 20-30 mins before your workout for a quick and easy energy boost. Maybe you haven’t hydrated enough?
nutrition,"Greek yogurt is basically just more concentrated. You get the same nutrition from a smaller bowl of thicker yogurt, but otherwise there is no nutritional difference. Personally I just strongly prefer the thicker texture."
nutrition,"I'm not an expert but I've read that the margins on whey products are quite low, so only very high output dairies can produce the bulk quantity to get a tanker truck to come collect it; with smaller ones rarely go to the trouble of buying new tanks and carefully collecting and storing it until they have a big enough pick up."

nutrition,I loooove tzatziki!! But I'm also addicted to sweet breakfasts. I do recommend trying full fat Greek yogurt for your salad. It's definitely worth it for taste and satiety.

nutrition,I love yogurt but I mostly use it as a component of things. You're a demonic entity
nutrition,Do you have problems with high blood pressure?
nutrition,"My yogurt delivery method has been a basically-tzatziki cucumber salad lately. I like finding ways to ""savory"" things like oatmeal and yogurt to avoid the feeling that I need sugar in it. I do a whole diced cucumber with roughly a heaping serving nonfat greek yogurt (around a cup, I do it all by weight), with minced garlic, salt and pepper, dill, pepper flakes, and some chopped pepperoncinis. I'll add up to 2 tbsp of olive oil depending on how my macros for the day are shaping up."
nutrition,Very true. I see your point now.
nutrition,"They don't have that kind where I live and I've never seen it in other stores. But I saw you posted the ingredients, should be easy enough to recreate, thanks 🤗"
nutrition,"That's beyond the point. You'd be rewarding Reddit and not OP, that's what I mean."
nutrition,"Thank you! If you do ever try going plant based, remember to take the high fiber that come with it into account. Go into it slowly and allow your GI and microbiome time to adapt. It will get worse before it gets better sometimes. I never thought I’d be able to eat whole grains again and now I can literally eat a whole bowl of popcorn...no blood no flares nothing. Best of luck 🤞 my friend!😁"
nutrition,Ok so why humans started agriculture when we can eat meat? Wouldn't you agree that we also evolved the last 10.000 years to eat grains and cooked lentils and stuff? Think about the next 10000 years what will we eat? Probably not that much meat
nutrition,"I think it would be better to store them separately honestly. I can imagine that the fruit would go quite soggy sat in the yoghurt while it was freezing and lose its bite. You often find fruit blended as a layer on top of a yoghurt or mixed in, but this would make the fruit used quicker as energy and not keep you as full for long.As long as they are frozen, both should be similar in shelf life being perishable goods I would reckon (Not a nutritionalist, going off of what I know)"

nutrition,Sure fiber deficiency is a problem but every single ingredient you eat doesn't have to contain fiber to meet your needs.
nutrition,"They can only eat what the farmer provides, which is likely the cheapest possible grain. Wild caught fish eat what nature intended."
nutrition,"I hope I'm answering your question: 

Calories are calories. If you want to lose weight your calorie intake has to be in a deficit. Go online and use a daily calorie calculator and find out what calorie count will put you at a deficit. Then since you want to build muscle mass I would consume protein totalling 45-60% of those calories. 

I would go with a 500 calorie deficit. Intermittent fasting helps me also, I'm doing a 16/8 fast schedule. 

I'm no pro but an old dude that's been playing this game for a long time. 

Hope I helped, good luck."
nutrition,"Honestly from a biochemical standpoint, the human body can’t metabolize the minerals in “chlorophyll” water the way plants do.  Furthermore, we have our own electron transport system, not entirely dissimilar to plants PS1/PS2 ETS, but the nutrient and electron transfer is different at the atomic level.  

That all being said, aside from drinking a green water that has a higher mineral/trace element concentration than your typical overpriced Jamba Juice sugar explosion, I highly doubt it has the therapeutic effects you’ve listed. 

TikTok is the same platform that lets people talk about how the covid vax is gonna brainwash you and give you radioactive three headed children so take what you read with a grain of salt."
nutrition,A lot of people say at least 1 gram per pound of lean mass. So if you are overweight then it would be significantly less than your bodyweight. However you should be eating at least 150g at your height and weight.
nutrition,It works.
nutrition,Yup get plain Greek yogurt and add honey if you want to sweeten it up! I always have green yogurt in my fridge because I use it as sour cream as well!
nutrition,"Not sure, but I do it all the time. The berries just turn soft, which makes it easier to mix into the yogurt though."
nutrition,"That “dye” is a natural pigment called astaxanthin found in crustaceans and krill. Wild salmon turn pink only after feeding in the ocean. A land locked salmonid usually has a white or pale pink flesh because pigments are less abundant in their diet. The normal feed for a farmed salmon does not include pigment because it is expensive so they are fed a finishing diet to give them pigment just before harvest.

Unsweetened with low sugar is essential for me in a yogurt, but considering this I wouldn't eat Greek yogurt again. Vegan yogurt has the same probiotics and benefits essentially and no animal products."
nutrition,"Thanks! I was also surprised as I was expecting the doctor to say I was morbidly low in each lolol. The food I was eating around then was oatmeal, chia seeds/flax, some vegan yogurt mixed with peanut butter, plus walnuts, almonds, plant milk (I think coconut was the one) and fruit + veggie every day. Peanut butter on it's own, pretzels, and a protein shake may have contributed also. If there are any other methods I remember or know of, I'll come and update this comment.

nutrition,"I did a blind taste test with my friends, topped some chili with greek yogurt and sour cream.  With my extremely reliable sample size of 5, we all chose greek yogurt in terms of flavour."

nutrition,Try the Fage brand. Their plain is bomb!
nutrition,Hi! Does anyone know if Spirulina will drastically cause weight loss? I was reading up on it and it says it's speeds up your metabolism. I feel like it has so many benefits and I want to keep using it (only a tsp a day) but i want to gain weight not lose it or stay the same.
nutrition,I personally prefer the thicker texture of greek yogurt.  Also cold whey from the fridge is a really refreshing drink.
nutrition,"Very healthy, opt for full fat to stay full longer."
nutrition,"I like the thick texture of Greek yogurt. If you prefer the thinner texture of regular yogurt, then there's no need to strain.

Additionally, acidic whey from yogurt is much less useful than sweet whey from cheesemaking. You can't make ricotta from yogurt whey, for example."
nutrition,"The only way to know for sure is to do studies and trials. 

With that said... aside from minerals and nutrients that you could get from other sources, I’m unaware of anything unique that we could get from chlorophyll. In theory the chloroplasts would be broken down just like when you eat a salad."
nutrition,"Yea, like the other post said get the sugar free. I eat it for a treat and to get some collagen at the same time although I prefer to supplement. My joints and tendons take a beating from working out so much at my age (late 30's, yea I know not that old but I'm doing high level exercises) so I need that collagen desperately. Just understand that collagen is a very low quality incomplete protein so don't factor it into your protein allotment if you monitor that. Make sure all of your protein requirement is fulfilled with higher quality protein sources. The amino acids that are present are good to have though as your body apparently produces less of them as you age so they become almost essential amino acids at that point--and collagen/gelatin are a good source of those."
nutrition,definitely a more useful way of looking at things than the binary healthy/unhealthy qualification of food
nutrition,"You’re right—either extreme can be really detrimental. Because fruit is super good for you. But at the same time, someone drinking 3 glasses of apple juice per day (“because it’s like having 12 apples!”) would also be detrimental, especially if they have no other vegetables or fruits throughout the day."

Some people still drink “malt liquor” and a “malt” that is a milk shake contains malt (and imo tastes better).

If you need more carbs, mix in some uncooked oatmeal and just a bit of water the night before as well for a quick, healthy breakfast!"
nutrition,"No evidence we ever got it from water, you'd need gallons.

You'd need to eat 150g+ of manure rich soil daily to get enough B12.

Most animals get B12 from coprophagy (shit eating) or from bacteria in their rumen feeding on cobalt.

Humans have only ever got B12 from meat until recently."
nutrition,"Surprisingly accurate. Although replace definitely bad for you with probably bad for you. Unfortunately the only truly healthy beverage is water, and possible tea or coffee without cream or sugar."
nutrition,"I love the taste and creaminess of the full fat variety, but it is has too much fat and too many calories for me. 

As a compromise, I get the nonfat variety of plain yogurt and stir in a dollop of the full fat Greek version."
nutrition,Interesting. Well pesticides wreak havoc on your body's hormones and immune system and so obviously a high pesticide fruit which has a fraction of the nutrients it's supposed to is not worth eating.
nutrition,"I guess it's better to eat fruit and just drink water for hydration instead. I like this subreddit, I never knew juice had to be fortified."

nutrition,I don't understand the downvotes mate. You spoke no lies.
nutrition,"Depends on the type. Flavored yogurts usually contain a fuck ton of sugar.

Plain, full fat greek yogurt though is full of protein and probiotics"
nutrition,"seems like it is more concentrated and consistently thicker.  I understand where you are coming from, making your own and all.  but as a consumer it makes sense to buy greek yogurt since it is more concentrated.  You are paying for less filler, essentially."
nutrition,"Yeah for sure, super high in protein so important for vegetarian diets! Like others mentioned, most (if not all) flavored yogurts are super high in added sugar so watch out for that!"
nutrition,"Texture: greek yogurt is much thicker.

Macro content: Greek yogurt is much higher in protein, and may be more geared towards someone's fitness goals or diet."
nutrition,Add your own fresh fruit for a bonus flavor instead
nutrition,"Haha I have this for breakfast most mornings, it is really good. I know what you mean with the consistency too, just stiffer than normal yogurt."

nutrition,"Calcium inhibits iron absorption regardless of whether it is given as Calcium salts or in dairy products. When you do eat meat, do you eat white or red meat? 

Heme iron found in animal products is better absorbed than plants, as it contains ferrous irons (+2). Plant iron is in the ferric form (+3), and consuming vitamin C can help convert it into ferrous. That means that adding lemon juice to your veggies or drinking orange juice with your dinner will maximize iron absorption from plant-based sources. Keep in mind that plants like spinach contain oxalates which block iron absorption. Coffee, milk, tea and zinc also negatively affect the absorption of iron."

nutrition,"In the 1950s Ancel Keys and fellow scientists observed that people living in the Mediterranean, especially on the isle of Crete, were lean and heart disease-free. And true, their diet consisted of olive oil, but it also had an abundance of fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, coarse whole-grain breads, beans, and fish. It was only around 20% fat. And they walked about nine miles daily, often behind an ox and plow.

But much has changed on Crete – and throughout the Mediterranean – since then. Today, the people of Crete still eat a lot of olive oil, but their intake of whole, natural foods has gone way down, as has their physical activity. The island’s new staples are meat, cheese, TV, and the Internet. Today, more than 60% of Crete’s adult population – and an alarming 50% of its children – are overweight."

Olaflur is a substance that basically has a part that can attach to your teeths enamel and the other part is hydrophobic, which keeps the enamel, that you've hopefully strengthened with fluorine, from dissolving. I hope this explanation is somewhat comprehensible my scientific English is not very good yet.."
nutrition,"Calcium, magnesium, zinc and iron all have the same intestinal transporter and there is only so much you can absorb at one time (around 700mg on average). So, yeah kinda, it can prevent absorption depending on the amount.

You didn't mention which anemia you have. Iron isn't the only one, but i guess since your talking about iron that that's what you ment. B9, B12 and copper deficiency are also causes. 

Copper is necessary for iron absorbtion. If you are copper deficient no amount of iron will help. 

Vitamim C increases iron absorption. 

Aronia (Siberian blueberry) has a good amount of iron for a plant and was pretty popular in past say 10 years or so when it comes to kts benefits one of which was fixing anemia. 

 If you settled for fortified cereal just take an actual supplement. There are plenty of properly made ones which won't cause any stomach upset.

If you dont have an appetite and don't want to eat meat it's probably either zinc deficiency or low stomach acid. These have had such effects on lots of people who loved eating meat and have no moral biases around it. I'm in the process of fixing such problems myself and it's insane how much zinc helped. I've yet to fix the stomach acid levels, which probably along with a few things caused malabsorbtion issues for me and the low appetite basically make me have a sub 1000 calories diet (i eat more but if i cant absorb it it doesnt matter)"
nutrition,"How you cook them makes a huge difference in how well they retain their nutrients. Some cooking methods preserve nutrients and even help them enter your bloodstream, while others can destroy them.

When you cook vegetables in water, you lose nutrients. That green hue the water takes on after you’ve boiled or blanched your broccoli? That’s a sign that vitamins like C and B have leached into the water, only to be poured down the drain. 

To retain the vitamins found in vegetables, cook them in as little water as possible for a minimal amount of time (unless you're planning to consume the water, as in a soup). Steaming and microwaving, both of which use little water, will give you the same results as boiling or blanching but with much less nutrient loss."

nutrition,"Of the 3 macronutrients - protein, fat, and carbohydrates - carbohydrates are a quicker, better source for energy than the others.  Protein is for building and repairing muscle and fat aids in several body functions and CAN be utilized for energy but at the same time 1g of fat has more than twice the calories of 1g of carbs.  You CAN try to rely on protein for energy but the body has to work harder to convert it into energy, harder even than fat.  This is why, according to my trainer, I felt like shit all the time when I first started my nutrition plan as I was eating very low carbs and high protein.

nutrition,"The study is unfortunately an observational study with low risk ratios and therefore not worth very much. 

The problem is that all observational studies are inherently confounded by factors. Some of those can be partly corrected for - perhaps on medical condition or family history - but unfortunately these corrections aren't perfect and there are always things that we can't correct for. They also tend to use poor measures of what people eat. 

The correct description of this study is something like.

*We looked at a set of data and compared those people who said they ate more processed meat to those who ate less and looked if there was a difference in dementia rates.* 

The problem being is that the people who eat lots of processed meat are different from those who eat little processed meat in a lot of different ones. 

One common one is known as ""healthy user effect"" - people who care about their health are just generally more healthy than those who don't. If you tell people to eat less meat, the healthy people are more likely to listen to you, and you get results like this. 

This is one of the reasons that there isn't a solid answer around things like eating meat; the observational data isn't really measuring what people think it's measuring. You can find observational studies that say all meat is bad, some that  only certain types of meat are bad, some where processed meat is bad and other meat is fine, etc. None of them are actually generating real information."
nutrition,"I would be cautious anytime you see the word ""could"" in a peer reviewed study. Anytime they use words like ""could"" or ""may"" to describe the outcome of a study, it generally means a very weak correlation. In this instance, could it be that people that eat processes meat are also more likely to eat other unhealthy foods or partake in unhealthy habits?

&gt;""Those who consumed higher amounts of processed meat were more likely to be male, less educated, smokers, overweight or obese, had lower intakes of vegetables and fruits, and had higher intakes of energy, protein, and fat.""

This should be the quote from that study that let's you know that this conclusion is a correlation without causation. There are much stronger correlations with high sugar consumption, especially fructose, and dementia risks. This is the reason why much of the medical community has moved to referring to alzheimers as Type 3 diabetes as it is an insulin regulation issue. Remember, we're always instructed to lower our cholesterol yet cholesterol is what protects our brains and neurons.... 

Unfortunately there will always be debate here and people on both sides of the argument but hopefully I was able to show you here that it is dangerous to just take conclusions drawn by studies without really dissecting the details."

nutrition,"\&gt; There have been studies in which they've fed people up to twenty servings of fruit a day and found absolutely no detrimental effects on their health, despite the copious amounts of sugar 

Neither of those studies support that assertion; they are both looking at fruit and vegetable intake. 

Further, the first one is observational data. It says:

 *This meta-analysis showed several inverse associations between fruit and vegetable intake and prospective improvements in anthropometric parameters, and risk of adiposity. The present meta-analysis seems to be limited by low study quality.* 

The second study says this:

*Our results suggest an inverse association between fruit and vegetable consumption and diastolic blood pressure in metabolic syndrome patients.* 

That's all they found."

nutrition,"What is the best way to healthily gain weight as a recovered anorexic?

I am 105lbs right now, but at my lowest I was &lt;100lbs. My weight has plateaued no matter how much I eat. I don't know how else I am supposed to gain weight. Even though I am in recovery, my doctors still think I am starving myself (they would not stop asking me ED questions) since my weight is still so low. I don't really keep track of what I'm eating or how many calories I'm consuming, but all I know is I eat 3 full meals a day with snacks. Yet, I still don't gain weight. I am active, I walk almost daily and do moderate exercise 3-4 days a week so that may contribute, but I can't quit doing exercises (I am not exercising to stay skinny/underweight) simply because I have other health issues that will worsen if I quit. I try to eat more snacks throughout the day but sometimes it will make me nauseous and the fullness hurts.

How can I safely gain weight? My goal to be at a healthy weight is 120lbs which is about 20 BMI for my height. It also doesn't help that I have severe ARFID which makes it impossible for me to eat most healthy foods without being disgusted and becoming nauseous. I feel like I am at a dead end."
nutrition,"Yes! Thank you, that is a relief. It's such a time-saving way!"
nutrition,I'm under the impression that the mineral nutrition from water is generally inconsequential. This is probably especially true if you eat a varied diet and/or take multivitamins.
nutrition,"&gt; Becasuse that is how recipies fucking work?!! 

Recipes are created using foods that complement each other. Not vice versa. OP is asking which foods go well together, not for actual recipes. You don't just make a spaghetti dish and toss in random spices and hope it tastes good. 

i.e. citrus goes well seafood, basil and tomatoes, mint and lime, strawberry and rhubarb, etc. These ARE  NOT recipes, they are complementary flavor pairings. There is a difference."
nutrition,"Every vitamin have a individual heat stability (niacin, riboflavin, vitamin E are heat stable and others like vitamin C, folate and pyridoxina are very sensible to hest) and factors like ph and contact area important. Steaming in vapor exposes vegetables to 100°c, while boiling oil have a temperature of 300°c."
nutrition,"Was reading this thread, late, but thought to chime in anyway. Lb issues are complex, as you probably know from PT, there's a stretching component, posture, sleep, muscle strength/tone.

So in that regard it seems prudent to optimise for lowering cardiovascular risk factors - however you want to go about accomplishing that."
nutrition,"Uh huh. Because scrolling through 50 random recipes is sooo useful. 

And by the way, it’s recipes. Not recepies. 

What is so hard to understand about this? Complimentary foods are not necessarily recipes. Is that really so hard for you to comprehend? Honey and peanut butter go well together. You don’t need a recipe to know that. 

Now, will you answer my question? How do you think recipes are created? By mashing random foods together and hoping the flavors go well together? Or, I don’t know, using *complimentary* flavors that you already know go well together? It’s a fairly simply question, surely a big brain like yourself could answer it."

My first real experience with Jiggs dinner was at my great uncles house, we started going every Sunday.

He would cook a Turkey stuffed with dressing, the dressing usually consisted of fresh bread crumbs and savory and I think diced onion.
The other meat would be salt meat, usually beef.
There would be peas pudding, cabbage, carrot, potatoes, turnip and greens.
Gravy would be made with broth from the turkey and some pot liquor, corn starch and gravy browning. That's pretty much it

Sometimes there would be a beef pot roast cooked with this as well and every Sunday there was atleast 12 people, I usually ate 2 plates. My great uncle used to make a desert but I forget what it's called, it was mainly just fruit in like a type of home made whipped cream.

My parents specifically get turkey for holidays, any regular Sunday it's chicken."
nutrition,"There are tons of vitamins and minerals, not to mention valuable protein sources in starchy vegetables. I would not recommend excluding them until you’ve done more thorough research."
nutrition,"Ok but you’re leaving out the one item that makes it Jiggs and that’s the salt beef (salt cured beef or pork, like corned beef). Without it it is not Jiggs, it’s a pot of boiled vegetables. I have never met a single person who drinks it for health, they use it to flavour other stuff like the gravy because it’s so high in salt it’s the reason the health science is on wheels 24/7."
nutrition,"Yes AKA vegetable broth
I don't drink it but that's because there is usually cabbage and I do not like cabbage lol however I would if I made it myself.
My parents tend to throw away what they won't use but it's part of the gravy recipe and I have seen older family members just grab a mug and fill it right from the pot lol I tend to wait until everything is done cooking first.
I have heard tell of people using it in their gardens as well but I'm not sure how well that works."

nutrition,"Hey all, 

I'm trying to get a really good hold on my diet, because I've gained a pretty good amount of weight during quarantine and need to drop it down. I used to just count calories loosely and that combined with a lot of exercise was fine, but as I'm getting older (I'm 30 now) I can tell my metabolism isn't keeping up as well. So I came up with something and wanted to run it by some people to see if it would provide a good balance of what I need. 

Breakfast

* Coffee (I use milk and a little raw sugar)
* Raisin Bran, Oatmeal, something like that, maybe eggs some days.

Snack

* Apple or Grapes or Cantaloupe

Lunch

*  I don't always have a ton of time so a smoothie is idea, plain organic yogurt, fruit, almond milk, sometimes coconut meal, is what I usually do.

Snack 2

* Carrots or Nuts or similar

Dinner

* I typically do something like baked chicken, pork, ground turkey (tacos type stuff), steak, and I combine that with one of the following depending on what it is (peas, carrots, green beans, broccoli, cauliflower, pinto beans). I will also sometimes do a sweet potatoes or regular potatoes baked or roasted. I may throw a carb in there as well like a tortilla or slice of bread, might also occasionally eat some pasta. 

Does this make sense? Is there stuff I'm really missing or things I'm having too much of? I know how to handle the portion sizes pretty well."
nutrition,"Alkaline water is only slightly basic (ph 8) and has no buffer capacity.  The second it touches the strong acid of your stomach (which has a ton of buffer capacity) it is now the ph of your stomach, and your stomach hasnt changed.  

The buffer capacity of alkaline water is so week that leaving it open to the air for a few hours will shift it towards acidic (co2 forming carbonic acid)."
nutrition,Not sure if vagmannen meant “caffeine” pills but I used to take a caffeine pill 15 minutes before my warm up. Super cheap and lasts awhile.
nutrition,"Or we could introduce food technologies such as sous vide, sprouting and fermentation to our ways of 'cooking' our food. They all increase bioavailability without the high heat or draining of water-soluble vitamins.

Also you could eat veggies with intention. If you eat spinach for the iron, you should saute it and not give a damn about the vitamins destroyed by the heat. After all, you're eating it for the iron."
nutrition,"*Eating* starches is not the same thing as *filling up* with starches. You probably *shouldn't* ""fill up"" with starches, but considering that they've had 0.8-1.8 million years availability in the human evolutionary timeline and are eaten wherever it isn't culturally prohibited, it's likely that they're necessary for optimal health."
nutrition,Some people with severe digestive disorders live on liquid elemental diets.
nutrition,"Yes, I'd love the recipe too, sounds great."
nutrition,"Good points.  So in an ideal world, we simply eat both raw and cooked veggies in similar portions."
nutrition,"Broccoli, cauliflower,cabbage, spinach, peas have a good amount of vitamins. Heat also degrades these vitamins, so steaming, microwaving and stir frying are better options than boiling."
nutrition,"Sure its makes it more bioavailable, but a loss of 25% of thiamin and riboflavin, and 50% loss of folate, B6 and C-vitamin when cooking with heat.

In general speaking it's mostly minerals that increase in bioavailability,  since they barely get lost due to heat, but gets released by salts and protein when cooked."

nutrition,"I too love sushi. Honestly though, it's mostly rice unless you're eating sashimi. In most rolls, you have  fish, veg, and seaweed which are very nutritious, but we're talking super-tiny bites in each roll. That being said, depending on your activity level, sushi can be a nutritious meal. I train weights fairly intensely 4 days a week and a bit of hard cardio 1-2 per week, so I feel good about throwing down on some sushi a few times per week. I need that carb replenishment. Folks that are a bit more sedentary are loading up on a load of simple carbs with sushi which may start to add up over time. Sushi would be super low on my list of anti-nutritious meals though. You could do so much worse!"
nutrition,"Okay and yeah no don't get me wrong I'm not raising it as an issue, it's just a conversation I've heard people having from friends to family members, so I just wanted to know if one does hold more nutrients than the other, that's all! 

Thank you for explaining though."
nutrition,I am being skeptical that it happens only to carrots.  Nutrients from most veggies become more bioavailble by cooking if you drink the broth.
nutrition,Most likely correct.
nutrition,Depend of time and temperature. Lower temperatures with less time destroy less.
nutrition,Yes i said one of the only. I know it's not very common but works for carrots.
nutrition,Citation?  I am pretty sure it it work for more than carrots.
nutrition,"Finally, a reasonable answer.  Humans started cooking for a reason - ""cooked meat make brain big""

But also, destroying enzymes can be good for things like pea protein, which contain enzyme inhibitors which can reduce absorption of nutrients."
nutrition,But the heat from cooking also makes alot of nutrients more bioavailable.  Extracts them out of the plant cell walls- which we can't digest.   That's why humans started cooking in the first place.
nutrition,"It is up for debate, a peak ripe vegetable will have the most amount of nutrients, if it is frozen there it will keep it. If you go to a store and buy a vegetable, you might chose one that is one day too early for peak ripeness. That could lead to less nutrients.

But this seems like a non-issue. If you get 90% or 95% of the nutrients, does it matter that much?"
nutrition,Vegetable broth.  Lol
nutrition,"""Pot liquor"" aka vegetable broth?

Who doesn't drink the liquid from the soup?  Do you throw it away.  Everyone knows that that is the best part with alot of the water soluble nutrients.  

So yeah, just drink the broth."

nutrition,"This is basically a ketogenic diet. Lots of people swear by it, and it would be good for someone trying to control their blood sugar, but as far as I know there haven't been any high-quality long-term studies on a diet like this. Also, carbs are the ""preferred fuel"" of muscles so a no- or low-carb diet might impede athletic performance.

I, personally, don't think I would do it long-term, but it's not the worst possible diet by a long shot, probably a lot better than just eating starch."
nutrition,I gave into the hype once and bought it everyday for a month from my gym. Certainly tastes good but it's no different than Monster or any other energy drinks. It's way more caffeinated than one cup of coffee though.

nutrition,"It depends on if the vitamins are capsules or tablets. The tablets will probably break down, but the hard plastic coating is too strong for the stew. 🤣"
nutrition,"The fitness forum is a good place to go and I think what you are looking for is clean bulking. 

Indian food as I understand it has a ton of cooking oil, so it may not be the best option for clean bulking. I don’t think you need that much fat. 

Also, you probably need a solid exercise regimen. Then based on your exercise, you can plan your macros. A lot of ppl have different macros for different training days. Legs days or days you work on big muscle groups usually call for extra carbs."

Being super rich in water, fruits are tender, easy to chew and quickly digested, one medium apple (150gr) has an orac value of 4500, fresh vegetables don't top at all the orac value of fruits, you have to eat 300 gr of fresh raw spinash to get as much antioxydant as one apple, 300 gr of raw spinach is way longer to chew, digest and would make you feel full. The main fruits's asset are clearly their antioxydant compund, they are the best at this category, especially berries . Dry spicies and herbs are more high in antioxydant but are irrelevant as we realistically don't eat more than 5gr a day and fresh source of antioxydants are proven to be superior."

nutrition,"Yes basically but elevated cholesterol. At LDL levels 70 and bellow this process doesn’t typically occur and plaques can in many cases be reversed. The calcification happens when the tissue around the lesion has degraded from the chronic inflammation and plaque build up that limits the endotheliums, the inner layer of cells of the blood vessel, access to nutrients and oxygen and becomes necrotic. The other poster explained this better. As far as I understand there is no calcification occurring in the early stages of atherosclerotic lesions, then it’s only cholesterol and macrophages.  So yes when you hear calcification of the blood vessels it’s really cholesterol + macrophages + calcium."
nutrition,"Okay it’s starting to make more sense. Just to clarify, the plaque builds up underneath the endothelial lining and ruptured when replicating smooth muscle cells find their way to the surface and eventually rupture exposing the plaque inside the lumen. This is when calcium gets involved to form a ‘scar’ over the rupture but sometimes plaque can break off and send an embolus throughout the vessel with the potential to form a new thrombus.

Calcium is only coming into play when the plaque ruptured through the endothelial lining. 

Do I have that right?"

nutrition,"When you go all out alkaline (alkaline foods and drink) the human body is at its healthiest. Alkalinity is a part of the ph scale (ph - is potential of hydrogen) hydrogen is the first element. The scale goes 1- 14, 7 being neutral, below 7 acidic - above 7 alkaline. We all know what acid does. Thus when you eat acidic foods your slowly, slowly, slowly eating yourself. Some call this the aging process. They also say disease cant exist in an alkaline environment, it needs an acidic environment. You see most people when they are I'll in any way there diet is usually quite a bit off. Personally I cant go alkaline for more than a few months (I like to eat everything) and alkaline is pretty much going green with all your food. Read Dr. Robert Young's ""The PH Miracle"" to get a good understanding"
nutrition,"When a low attenuation plaque with a necrotic core ruptures the endothelial lining and is exposed to the blood inside the lumen, most of the time this rupture will seal itself with a calcified portion of plaque on top of the rupture. So, the calcifications are like the scab left over from a healed wound. 

When the rupture is not able to heal itself, then you potentially have a thrombus (blood clot) which may be able to block the artery or travel in the arteries to another area with stenosis (lumen blockage) and cause blockage at that part of the blood vessel.

This is not to say the calcifications are not potentially sources of further rupture and injury.

The nutrient calcium does not play a role in this calcification process as it relates to blood vessels.

Hope that makes sense."

25 male, 

Negative for celiac,
Negative for PA,
Occasionally IBS like cramping but nothing like what I would expect with Crohns or IBD 
Not a vegan or vegetarian, plenty of meat and animal products in my diet. 

Now we’ve tracked these levels every 3 months for 2 years now. It’s dipped below normal only once (172 I think) that was when I was hardly eating I was so stressed which may have contributed. Noticed a little easy bruising then-otherwise it’s always 181-195 with the cutoff here being 180. From what I understand that’s still very much low normal. I tried oral supplements and it didn’t budge the number.

Given I don’t have any symptoms and tested negative for anything else could this maybe just be my baseline? I mean it’s not going down at all and I would check it once or twice a year to be sure but isn’t it odd it would sit right at the cutoff to normal? I’m not asking medical advice but just asking if this level is acceptable?"

I asked my doctor several years ago and he said as long as I'm getting healthy fats don't worry about it. The rest of my diet is healthy, I can go into detail if necessary. For healthy fats the bulk of it comes from 1 avocado, \~25almonds, and olive oil daily. I realize they are high in calories; I am tracking my calories, weight, and bodyfat%--it's not a problem.

I used to eat stuff like flaxseeds but I heard it's not an effective replacement to fish oil, something about the body needs to convert it and only 10% of it gets utilized I forgot what I read.

And for every... Who has something agains fruit and fructose, fruit has fiber and slowly releases fructose in a way in which the liver can *easily* deal with it. Fructose is not the problem, rather is the rate at which your getting it (so amount per time).

We have moved on from this and there is no definitive answer on the matter."
nutrition,"Depends. Different oils have different smoking points? (the temperature in which they start to burn and to produce toxic acrolein). The more saturated fatty acids an oil has, the higher you can heat it/the more unsaturated, the less heat resistant.

Generally speaking, you want to have more unsaturated fatty acids in your diet as they have health benefits like binding free radicals. Cold pressed oils also have a lot of micronutrients that are sensible to heat like some vitamins, so cooking with them could destroy them.

There are plant oils that are refined in a way to make them extra heat resistant (oil X for frying) but they are obviously processed and don't have the same health benefits anymore. There are also some oils that are more heat stable than others, depending on their ratio of saturated Vs unsaturated fatty acids and if they are cold pressed semi refined or completely refined. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Smoke_point_of_cooking_oils

Personally I have an cooking oil which is processed and heat stable and cold pressed oils which I use like seasoning after cooking or in salad dressing (they are also way to expensive for me to use like I use the cooking oil 😄).

You can use cold pressed oils while cooking depending on the temperature needed. Sauteing onions should be good, frying a steak not so."
nutrition,Why do you want to eat fruit before you go to bed? Typically fruit is best consumed early in the day on an empty stomach for maximum nutritional benefits.

nutrition,"There's no definite answer, and it depends on your ingredients/overall-lifestyle. If someone asked me to make ""fried rice"" this afternoon, and I was trying to be moderately healthy:

I'd probably get some **full grain rice and other grains** (recently I've been getting a mix of red-rice, bulgar wheat, and a few other grains, to make it more varied and tasty.

Pick out some **nice veggies** to chop and add to the mix, garlic, onion, babycorn, mangetout, broccoli, pakchoi, chilli etc are all good basics to involve with fried rice. Some five-spice, sunac, cumin, chilli and paprika are worth experimenting with aromatically.

The important thing is that you use a **good quality non-stick wok**, thick enough to stay hot when you add cold food, and only use a **LITTLE BIT** of oil whilst you keep the food rotating and stirring. **Coconut, olive oil, peanut oil** can work, however which oil is healthiest is another can of worms, just pick a good quality one with a high smoke point (as frying gets very hot).

If you eat meat, a little bit of grilled and chopped chicken/beef/etc can make the whole meal ""meaty"", if you're cooking for a veggie you could add an egg or some tofu, I love my meats but fried rice is something I'm starting to prefer the vegan way.

nutrition,"Proven? No, not really."
nutrition,"Awesome!  Thanks so much for explaining that.    Isn't it quite normal to start burning fat at some point even if taking in carbs though.  That's how people lose weight (fat)?  Or do you just mean to get to the point where you're not taking in any carbs and burning fat much more efficiently takes a long time?  

Is that something that's becoming more popular in high endurance circles or do people like those runners you mentioned just do it to test themselves?"
nutrition,"I 100% agree! Things like databases on nutritional values of food should be public and accessible. And happy I could help!

Effects of low fructose diet on glycemic control, lipid profile and systemic inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes"
nutrition,"When I was young, that was pretty much true.

As a 50-year-old serious cyclist on a low-fat ""healthy athlete"" diet, that was very much not true. 

I'd \*really\* like to eat more fruit than I do, but humans just aren't good at dealing with large quantities of fructose over time."
nutrition,"&gt;Fruit contains sugar and the primary and preferred source of energy for the human body is... sugar.

To generalize, fruit contains roughly equal proportions of fructose and glucose, perhaps a bit more on the fructose side. Pretty close to sucrose, closer to the most common form of HFCS. 

Glucose is used by the body but - with the exception of the brain and red blood cells - it's not really ""preferred"". It's just that the body will burn it first to try to get your blood glucose back under control. 

Fructose metabolism is very different, and that's what drives metabolic diseases."
nutrition,"He is downvoted probably because of this:

&gt; Well, sugar does spike your blood sugar and insulin levels but it cannot cause diabetes. It is fat that literally gums up to works and causes diabetes. 

This is just not correct. We know what causes type2 diabetes: insulin resistance. What causes insulin resistance? Well, anything that persistently raises insulin: 

* anything that raises stress hormones, specifically cortisol, including not enough sleep
* inflammation
* sugar and starches
* omega 6 fats (not in themselves, but if combined with sugar/high carb diet)"
nutrition,"&gt;There have been studies in which they've fed people up to twenty servings of fruit a day and found absolutely no detrimental effects on their health, despite the copious amounts of sugar.

It would be great if you could link one."
nutrition,"Recreational cyclist, riding about 100 hill mile a week. Low fat diet, carbs before/during/after all my rides. 6'1"", 172 lbs. 

Hit 50, my weight started going up without a change in diet and got significant postprandial hypoglycemia after carby meals. Got all the way up to 178 lbs, but even at that weight I was never fat. 

Pretty obvious to me that I was insulin resistant. Changed my diet, and I'm down to 163, no more energy issues. 

Search ""medically obese normal weight"" on google scholar; you'll find more information.

nutrition,I’m looking to do a juice cleanse but don’t want to make the juice myself. Anyone have a recommendation on where to buy the juices I use?
nutrition,How's your HOMA-IR?
nutrition,Rise of insulin you would get from the recommended 3 servings of fruit is negligible at best. It’s not like we’re drinking sodas non stop getting tons of high fructose corn syrup. It’s over-inflating the scale of what’s actually happening here. If fruit actually had an effect on the insulin enough to be a cause of concern we wouldn’t recommend you eat it just like we don’t recommend people eat things with unnecessary added sugars.
nutrition,"See this thread, just down the page:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/mjghp5/why\_is\_everyone\_and\_their\_mother\_villainizing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/mjghp5/why_is_everyone_and_their_mother_villainizing/)"
nutrition,"There's a catch-22 at work here.

If you are an athlete who eats a high-carb diet and carbs before/during your workout, you will be great at burning glucose and poor at burning fat, so if you don't take in carbs during your event - assuming it's an extended event - you will burn up all your stored glycogen and ""bonk"", which is really no fun at all. So you are ""dependent"" on carbs for your workout, and if you don't have them, your performance is much worse. 

While if you are an athletes who regularly trains at low intensity in a state where there isn't a lot of glucose around - fasted is best - then you will, over time, become pretty decent at burning fat, and then you need much less glucose during your extended exercise. Whether you can get away with no glucose depends on the event and duration, but there was a group of 8 runners last year who each ran 100 miles over 5 days without any food - just water and electrolytes. I've personally run a fasted half-marathon without any issues (I've only been running about a year, so that's my longest run to date).

So, the short answer is that if you flip your training to improve your fat burning, you don't need a lot of carbs during your workout. But it will take time to get there; initially you will just feel dead without the carbs. 

Finally, the idea that fat can't produce a lot of energy is a bit of a myth. It \*is\* true that above a certain level of intensity, all the additional energy comes from burning glucose, but a group of keto ultra runners could burn - on average - about 1.5 grams of fat per minute, which is about 90 grams per hour or over 800 calories per hour. That's a very high rate of energy production, and that was the group average."
nutrition,"&gt; But sugar is just energy and your body will make sugar out of other macros in the absence of it. In fact when you lose weight and use your fat as energy your body is turning the fat into sugars to use. 

Unfortunately it is not that simple because sugar load matters. If you eat refined sugar (or drink liquid sugar, like fruit juice), your body gets a huge sugar load in a small timeframe - to which it reacts with pumping out a lot of insulin. Insulin is best kept as low as possible as long as possible, so eating low glycemic foods is recommended.

When the body converts stored fats/protein into glucose, there is no rise in insulin levels."
nutrition,"If you are worried about cholesterol in any way - the quickest, most effective fix would be to eliminate animal foods from your diet. Cholesterol only comes from animal food sources. My cholesterol levels are way below my levels from 4 years ago.  I too was having issues as well as high blood pressure back then. Also, really bad acid reflux. All gone and healed up now."
nutrition,"If you’re clean bulking then you don’t increase your calories to a high number. And stick to the number until you see no difference in weight. And then you add more calories to the week &amp; so on.
What you’re saying is basically filling a tub of water for a week then emptying the next week. End result would be nothing but hard work with minimal results.

nutrition,"&gt;we all know what a healthy individual is

I think that's not actually true. 

I have a pretty good friend. 40s, male, 6' 3"", thin, active. Looks fit and healthy. Ran into him one day recently. He has type II diabetes. 

It's common enough that there's a name for that group - Metabolically obese normal weight.

My point being that we judge people based on what we see, and insulin resistance doesn't necessarily show. Yes, it's true that the majority of people who have a lot of weight are quite insulin resistant, but people with normal weight or just a little extra weight can also be quite insulin resistant."

nutrition,You are not going to get gallstones from skipping a meal occasionally. Promise.
nutrition,"I used to think the same way as you. I was scared of fruits. But now, I’m healthier than I’ve ever been. I would rather eat a lot of fruit than having junk food when my brain craves for sugar, it satisfy me ❤️🥲"
nutrition,I hate having breakfast and found it makes me more hungry during the day.  I have one meal a day and maybe some fruit but plenty of water and it seems to be doing the trick for loosing weight but just eat when your body tells you it needs it.
nutrition,How many people doing low carb are eating liver? Be serious right now
nutrition,"Also important to note I am not doing intermittent fasting practices during strenuous workouts or work days either, it's usually my Sunday routine, the most I would do is a small walk. It's mainly reading and relaxing lol"
nutrition,"Missing a meal here and there does not cause gallstones. They are primarily caused by an imbalanced, fatty diet.  I suggest you do a google search and show your family the results. Sounds like an old wives tale."
nutrition,"I have never heard of anyone being in poor health or developing gallstones from skipping meals.

The gallstone thing doesn't even make sense to me, since gallstones are mainly cholesterol and come from EATING, so if anything, I'd be questioning my families knowledge on the topic and where they learned it because what they are saying doesn't even seem to be real.

I have practiced intermittent fasting for a few years, I have tried a variety of things on those days.
I have tried 24 hour fasting, I have tried only eating for an 8 hour period, I even did 24 hour fasting with only water.
I'm not dead, no gallstones, no poor health either LOL.

Obviously it's best to listen to your body, knowing is half the battle, but I don't think you have anything to worry about at all if you only do this twice a month, considering the fact I do it weekly."
nutrition,Thank you!
nutrition,"Its still intermittent fasting, you just do it very rarely instead of making a lifestyle change like most of us. So, a bit of a grey area. But, yes, technically still intermittent fasting. 


And as long as your a healthy weight, then yeah, just make sure you eat enough that you don't go into a calorie deficit. Most of us who are doing intermittent fasting do it for weight loss, so we purposefully do it for the calorie deficit. But if your not looking to lose anything, then just make up the calories with your next meal. 


But really, what it sounds like you are doing is just intuitive eating. Eating when your hungry and not eating when your not. Your listening to your body. You shouldn't force yourself to eat when your not hungry. Just make sure you keep hydrated and listen to what your body is telling you to. Skipping a couple meals every once in a while isn't going to hurt anything."
nutrition,Missing a meal is completely fine! Professional boxers making weight have awful practices where they effectively starve themselves for couple days to make weight for competition (this is very unhealthy and a practice that should be banned) but missing one meal is perfectly healthy! Hear what your body is saying!
nutrition,well my primary concern is gallstones which they keep saying im gonna get. and i dont even know if i would put this on the same level as fasting as i only do this like once or twice a month
nutrition,"listen to your body, fasting works just greats for a lot of people. On the other hand, it is true that sometimes it can lead to an unhealthy relationship with food."
nutrition,"You can eat exactly when you want. The three meals a day idea started as a marketing scheme to get people to buy bacon in the early 1900s. Another thing that might have pushed it was the fact that native Americans would eat when they were hungry and not according to schedule and the invading Europeans thought this was gross, disorganised and caveman-like so scheduled eating was pushed as a result."
nutrition,Can it really be considered like intermittent fasting if I only do this very rarely like once or twice a month? And as long as I make up the calories its fine?
nutrition,"There’s nothing wrong with fruit so long as it’s fresh and raw, especially if the other choice would be anything processed. This isn’t the 1600’s where people thought fruit was bad for them. Don’t devolve."

nutrition,Whats the issue if it goes to the liver?
nutrition,"18 months before I started adding back plants. there was a 6 week transition period that felt like it lasted a decade but then I started feeling like a million bucks about 3 months in. I started slow with reintroduction, one thing at a time. I found I really didn't have any issues at all with each new food I added back in. I really missed plants, and while I felt like a whole new person eating just meat I really was looking forward to chowing down on all the plants I love.

Obviously they need to talk to their doctor before starting any kind of drastic changes. I was having regular blood work the whole time and my team of doctors were fully aware of what I was doing.

They can also check out the specific carbohydrate diet, that gives lots of people some relief. It's also a meat-centered diet but you still eat a variety of veggies at every meal, just specific ones that are easier to digest. It's very similar to an elimination diet as your first phase is very restrictive and you add in foods as you can tolerate them.

Another one is the low residue, or low fiber diet. People will do that temporarily to give their digestive systems a little bit of a break when things are heating up. A carnivore diet is definitely in this category, but again, most low fiber folks still eat low fiber veggies every day."

Now if you're eating a plant-based diet you probably get very little calories from your other food sources, unless you eat a ton of beans, so that can partially balance it out.

I actually had an omega-3/omega-6 test recently (hence looking into it more) and my omega-3 index level was 6.9%, which appears to be quite a bit more than the average you've quoted (assuming it's the same thing).   I had an omega-6 to omega-3 ratio of 11.8:1 though, so wondered how much attention I should pay to that.  Most of my omega-6 is from healthy sources though (peanut butter (100% peanuts), almonds, oats, pasta, rice, olive oil).

Breakfast - eggs, cheese, slice of toast, avacado, sautéed bell pepper, onion, steamed carrots, roasted sweet potato with skin on

Lunch - salad greens topped with cucumber, beet slices, chicken breast, pomegranate seeds, ginger miso dressing

Dinner - protein shake with 1.5 bananas, around 0.5 cup kale, 1-2 dates, serving peanut butter, oat milk, some hemp/flax/chia seeds

This adds up to a LOT of fiber and I love eating healthy but I’m not sure if it’s the reason why my digestive system feels backed up sometimes. Especially when lying in bed.

I knew a guy who discovered that when he was barfing he could actually keep down doritos. Of all things. It's now his go-to food when he's feeling like shit. Lol. Can you imagine your doctor telling you to eat strictly doritos until you feel better? Bodies are weird."
nutrition,"Go and read up on how atherosclerosis forms. Then you'll understand why meat/saturated fat doesn't cause coronary heart disease. There is MAJOR studies done on this and they support this fact.

I'll explain super briefly:  you have low density lipoproteins (LDL) which carry fats the tissues to be used as energy. You then have HDL which cleans up excess LDL in th blood and takes it to the liver to be metabolised.
Okay so this is REALLY important to understand: this system works extremely well and is really tightly regulated! Dietary cholesterol has ZERO effect on the bodies cholesterol levels. If you eat more cholesterol, your body will make less, if you eat less- your body will make more.

Okay, now when you have irritants in the bloodstream from smoking or excess glucose- you damage the walls of your blood vessels. The LDL boat becomes oxidised when exposed to free-radicals and it plasters over the blood vessel as a ""bandaid"". This is what causes atherosclerosis."
nutrition,"The UK 5 a day recommendation is based on approx 5x80g portions.  So the aim is to have population eating about 400g per day.

It’s not an exact science.  The more you eat, generally, the better.  I’ve found that people who are concerned about whether or not they’re hitting the target are not people we need to be worried about 🙂"
nutrition,"Yup. You're 100% right. Fibre is only necessary if you're eating lots of carbohydrates. When you eliminate thoze starchy carbohydrates there's no need for fibre. Your stool practically becomes almost liquid and just comes out. Also meat based diets are the ebst ways to get the B-complex because they're higher and more bioavailable!

You're also right on phytochemicals! No studies have shown them to have any health benefits! I don't know why peoppe are downvoting you- my guess is: cognitive dissonance."
nutrition,"&gt; healthy (MUFA/PUFA) fats

You sound fairly smart. Do you really think PUFAs are good?

Nutritionists have always have had a chip on their shoulder about dietary fat and I don't think they're over it. With the development that [saturated fat was just never that harmful in the first place](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/newsroom/featured/experts-challenge-who-recommendations-on-saturated-fats2), the dust still hasn't settled on what a real fat intake should look like and there's decades of bullshit to reconsider.

Olive oil is great, omega 3s are great, nuts are great, cheese is fine. But there's an enormous issue that people keep putting PUFA oils in deepfryers. Deepfryers used to have partially hydrogenated vegetable oils in them. Swapping them for soybean oil is not a fucking improvement. What do ya reckon"
nutrition,"Hi! So I disagree with your three main reasons and here is why:

1.) Gluconeogenesis works really well. A low carb diet that has lots of protein and fat is EASILY able to make glucose from the protein you eat and not muscle tissue.
2.) Studies have shown that Fibre is not as necessary on a keto based, low carb diet- you also get loads of B vitamins from the meat that you consume. Phytochemicals is a strange point because there is absolutely NO proof that their health benefits exist :)
3.) I totally agree that it's hard to sustain! That's why most people cycle on and off. And I hope they didn't teach you in your degree that saturated fat causes atherosclerosis which leads to heart disease, because it does not. It does increase LDL but LDL is not the problem, it's OXIDISED LDL that is. So people om low carb diets shown really good heart health, they also show a decrease in insulin resistance and I genuinely think I've just destroyed your argument here :)"
nutrition,"Omg. Are you sure you want to know? Is it enough to say that many years ago I lost count of how many times I had shit my pants? One time it happened in stop and go traffic in LA. It happened my first week in my new shop when I was in the military. I reached into the fridge to grab my water bottle and then filled my pants with angry liquid out of nowhere. I've shit myself in my sleep numerous times as well. I have puked on my pillow in my sleep, too, and woken up time and again because my mouth was filling with barf. I have taken countless shits on hikes in the woods. I've pulled over and puked on the freeway and shit myself while doing so. Any trip out of the house required imodium before hand and extra for the trip just in case. I couldn't eat in a restaurant because smelling food would stimulate my digestive system and I'd always have to go take a shit right away. Without fail once I'm in that public bathroom I start to have maaaad crazy anxiety about needing to throw up and panicking about the logistics of being in a public bathroom while needing to puke and shit simultaneously. We tried a few times to go out to eat and it was always the same story so we just gave up.

Super gross stuff since all that wasn't bad enough:

My liver and pancreas really have a very hard time sometimes and I don't have a gallbladder any more. Seems like my body sometimes gets things backwards, like turning all of my food into puke rather than poop. Same with my biliary system. 

Bile would get stopped up for reasons unknown and get dumped into my stomach where it truly does not belong and it would cause loads of barfing. Then the bile would change its mind and violently flood my intestines faster than it could be absorbed and it came right out of me pretty much unchanged. 

The toilet would be full of straight liquid, no solids, and everything would be covered in a thick, slimy, viscous, mucous laden layer of super bright highlighter yellow bile. When you're done you have to clean the toilet bowl every time because bile is dense and sticky and syrupy and it coats everything like thick grease. You have to clean under the toilet seat every time, too, because your asshole is shooting it out of you at warp speed. Super fucking gross. 

So many hours of my life spent hanging out in the bathroom in the middle of the night, butt naked, crying, pleading with a god I don't believe in, making promises I can't keep, while emptying my barf bucket and cleaning the toilet yet again that day. Sad times. 

Let's not get started on anal tears that go all the way into your poor little tortured butthole."
nutrition,What are the goals? Maximum muscle growth or strength gain? Cardio?
nutrition,Excellent info - well said! :)
nutrition,Exactly what I wanted to say &lt;3
nutrition,Absolutely. Stressed me out when people suggest fruit is unhealthy: get a grip.
nutrition,"Biotin supplements (even like 20%) are major triggers for my acne. There are some gummy prenatals without them, but you have to read labels when you’re in store. The Olly prenatal gummies don’t have biotin, and there is a certain CVS “compare to” gummy prenatals (I can’t remember what they “compare to”) that is biotin free too. Online, the Solimo (Amazon’s brand) prenatal gummies work too. The Hello Bello prenatal gummies seem to be (nutritionally) exactly the same as the Solimo ones.

I have yet to find a biotin-free non-gummy option. They may exist in big tablet form, but I hate taking those.

I’ve found that multivitamins without biotin aren’t as “complete” as ones with biotin, even for gummies. That may be a good thing if you don’t struggle with getting enough dietary calcium or iron though."
nutrition,"I completely understand what you mean! I learned chemical reactions and all that. But at the end of the day, was really only taught one diet as a one size fits all (with exception of medical issues) which is not the case in real life. This, coupled with the culture of dismissing patients and being condescending made me switch career paths after I graduated lol"
nutrition,"Nutrition is really just the application of biochem, it’s super fun to learn. (I was a biochem major before switching to nutrition &amp; felt the classes were the exact same) 

Persons with degrees in nutrition (like a bachelors &amp; up) learn all of these pathways and have to learn the chemical reactions. The problem lays in that “nutritionist” is not a regulated term, so any random person can say they’re a nutritionist &amp; know literally nothing about nutrition"
nutrition,"&gt; How not to die says vitamin b12 supplementation is absolutely vital. He also strongly recommends d3 supplementation.

saved"
nutrition,"Very well said. Keto just seems so wrong to me. I imagine a diet without white flour and added sugar as healthy, not a diet without carbohydrates of any kind."
nutrition,"I call my diet a plant diet and one that is mainly whole plants. I used to call it a plant-based diet but that is sometimes misunderstood by people who think they can put lettuce on their cheesy meat burger and call their diet 'plant-based'. I remember in the 1980s some meat eaters would eat meat but call themselves vegetarian because they thought it was trendy. For many years I called myself vegan (and I sometimes still do) but these days people assume vegans mostly eat all the newly available vegan junk, fake meat or processed foods."
nutrition,just eat some fruit and don't worry
nutrition,There are a lot of morons out there.  I find it best to not listen to anyone and make up my own mind.
nutrition,I tried carnivore for a couple of months partly because of issues with bloating and it’s the best bowels ever felt.
nutrition,"if you look deep enough, every food has negatives. with fruit it is the sugar and fructose. But keep in mind you are not just eating sugar, fruit comes with soo much benefits that they certainly outweigh the odds. Also notice how most obese people rarely eat fruit. Fruit can never make you fat, what makes you fat is high calorie, low fiber foods."
nutrition,Wouldn’t this just be maintaining then?
nutrition,"I think these are two separate questions that deserve two separate answers (accredited dietitian and PhD candidate here). In terms of physical health: Keto diets do help *some* people achieve particular health outcomes like improvement in diabetes management; but sometimes they end up causing extremely elevated LDL. Meat-based keto diets are by definition low in fibre and polyphenols, so aren’t great for your gastrointestinal and general health long term (gut bacteria need fibre to produce SCFA etc). Keto with lots of low-carb veg usually won’t result in any deficiencies. In terms of whether it’s a sustainable or mentally healthy diet is another conversation entirely. Anecdotally in practice I see keto as a stepping stone to ED behaviours, and as an extremely financially inaccessible diet. 

Regarding doctors: I’m sick to death of doctors recommending anything beyond a basic healthy diet with lots of veg, variety and healthy (MUFA/PUFA) fats. Doctors are people and can have their personal opinions on what diets they like. It’s however entirely inappropriate to recommend a clinical diet to someone in a 5 minute consult without any adjacent resources, dietetic support, or follow-up. Every single GP I’ve worked with has caused my clients so SO much confusion through suggesting low-carb/keto as an automatically healthy diet regardless of their specific health concern. If you have diabetes? Maybe. If you have diabetes with associated anxiety or malnutrition? Absolutely not. If you have heart disease? Nope. Eating disorder? Fucking no brainer."
nutrition,Try cooking the leafy vegetables.
nutrition,"Go with a cup size of everything as a serving, and if you have 10 cups sized portions of veg a day you'll be getting s good amount of veg"
nutrition,Fasting and eating plenty of beans. That worked wonders for myself.
nutrition,"My partner was recently diagnosed with crohns, a couple of years ago we both tried the keto diet and he said he felt great on it, while I felt terrible! I have been trying to encourage him to do it again"
nutrition,"I wanted to second the other post on here saying this is the most level headed comment, maybe ever? As someone who has done keto and it is the only lifestyle that got me to a healthier weight in 10 years. It's almost as if people forget about the psychological aspect and eating disorder community. Not everyone has a healthy relationship with food and for health reasons, needs to work within those parameters. Thank you for your comment!!"
nutrition,"You know, people like you remind me of that clean energy cartoon: ""But what if it's a scam and we create a better world for nothing?"". Like health or not (and current research does indicate animal products are very much not healthy, sorry pal), current levels of meat and fish production are not sustainable. Most emissions are driven by the cattle industries, the oceans are emptying, deforestation hit crisis points long ago. Not to mention the Indigenous people literally hunted into extinction by illegal loggers (to make place for cattle feed) and all the people whose water and lands have been poisoned by the waste produced by cattle and pig farming (this happens a lot in the US, btw, especially among vulnerable communities where rates of cancer and other diseases skyrocketed as a result). So, you know, I'm not a militant vegan here. I just think life on the planet and the lives of vulnerable people are worth protecting. You want to eat meat, fine. Just eat a bit less of it, and get it from a sustainable source. Please do some reading on this subject instead of trolling reddit users."
nutrition,I do. It takes three seconds.
nutrition,"I don't know if it's possible to quantify that. Both animal products and sugar cause inflammation in the body and disrupt important processes, creating an environment where stuff like cancer cells is more likely to grow. Obesity add a whole other layer of complications. It's like asking whether it's worse be a smoker or obese: ideally, don't be either."
nutrition,"And the body regulates its own production according to dietary intake but just like everything else, too much is too much"
nutrition,Very well said. I have always thought exactly this but struggled to put my thoughts into a coherent statement like this. I couldn’t agree more
nutrition,"Why would the minority (less than 50%) not matter?

If this ideal was followed, almost nothing would be studied?

I take exception because I'm the minority. Tens of thousands of dollars wasted on medical professionals who refused to consider anything outside the mainstream as a possible solution."
nutrition,"This is unfortunate and concerning.

1) A ketogenic diet isn't zero carbohydrate. In my experience, most people end up eating more produce (non-starchy veg and low sugar fruit) than they didn't when 60-80% of their diet was starch. Plus lactose if you enjoy dairy, or carbs in nuts and seeds.

2) As someone else pointed out, best source of B vitamins is meat. Cruciferous veg is plentiful in fiber. Phytochemicals are non-essential by definition, but see point #1.

3) Keto has higher retention rate than other dietary patterns (per sources in my research thesis) and I have no idea what you're referencing on heart disease. Plenty of long term keto followers have been getting CAC scans showing zero plaque.  I haven't seen data showing higher rates of cardiac events in people eatting whole food ketogenic diets compared to another dietary pattern."
nutrition,"Hi, registered dietitian here. I say they need to stay in their lane and stop Cherry-picking research that supports their views."
nutrition,https://www.forksoverknives.com/what-to-eat/
nutrition,"&gt;The ancient Greeks new the trick “everything in moderation” 

Especially moderation."
nutrition,"Ahh I see, but like"
nutrition,"I have experience in both dietetics and in medicine and I agree with the general premise of your post. There *is* too much ego and agenda clouding potential new discoveries. The human body *is* adaptable, and frankly, no conclusive research exists to explore the full extent of that adaptability and its implication in nutrition and health. 

My professional advice is to stay away from restrictive diets of any kind, unless you have a medical condition that necessitates it. Too often, the stress of trying to eat the perfect diet is more detrimental to overall health than the actual diet. This is intuitively true, and also scientifically true: stress (cortisol) impairs insulin response (along with many other biological pathways), which is a primary factor in many chronic diseases including obesity. I don’t trust health professionals who swear by a single diet. Food has never been standardized in the history of humankind. 

I will also caution against the premise of a diet itself. Nutrition is often touted as a brand new, cutting edge field that the “establishment” can’t see or refuses to see, but this is generally false. An understanding of statistics and external/internal validity reveals that it’s near impossible to accurately model eating behavior across multiple different populations (at least with current technology). The lack of convincing research generally stems from that.

A saying from a brilliant colleague that I keep in mind amidst these conversations: “The modern world sees food just as a means to control body size and shape, and they call it health.” Food has had cultural and traditional relevance for centuries. This is important. Food is not a pill you take."
nutrition,"Sugar bread fruits seem less nutritious than whole nutrition fruit

Seedless Watermelon is a disgusting abomination
   Less flavor
   Less scent
   Less seeds"
nutrition,"I think carbs don't get enough of a bad rap. Nutrition authorities have failed to acknowledge the harm of white bread, it is not an innocent filler. Refined grains are consistently associated with adverse health, more strongly than saturated fat, but guidelines still take a light approach and say ""eat 15 servings of grain a day, just try to make it at least 50% wholegrains teehee"".

To be fair, I agree with your general point that carbs are not *inherently* harmful and not everyone needs to go on keto. But most carbs in the world right now are bad carbs."
nutrition,You can do high carb and low carb days but what you're suggesting may not get you anywhere.
nutrition,Cognitive dissonance. People who usually advocate for less fruit in diets are also people who eat more meat.
nutrition,"I recommend seeking a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). Using the internet as a resource for nutrition information is very confusing. You’ll find a lot of conflicting information. Nutrition is specialized, especially if you have a disease. An RDN can provide you with the best information to optimize your nutrition for your own body :)"
nutrition,It's really hard to lock people up for 10 years and feed them controlled meals. It's the nature of the beast it seems.
nutrition,"That is... excessive. You would need to ask a doctor if it’s “ok” or ok for you, but that seems like a lot."
nutrition,"I guess it depends on the specific professor, but I've definitely seen professors not understand the reasoning behind anything they say, they just memorize text books and repeat them. Not just talking about these new trends like fasting, veganism, and keto, just in general like ""what is the mechanism that allows high-blood pressure to be treated with a low-salt diet?"" and they don't know. Or professors that basically say ""google the disease and look for the recommendations from whatever large body talks about it"", because they don't know how or why they arrive at the guidelines.

Maybe I've had bad professors, idk."
nutrition,"Most people who *think they’re doing Keto* haven’t researched what it actually is. 
R/Keto has a faq section that’s quite comprehensive and blows apart a lot of people’s very simplistic preconceptions of what that kind of diet actually entails."
nutrition,"I don't know why you got downvoted, seems like a sensible take. Psychological factors are huge when it comes to people actually doing things.

Hell, I've seen some people not be vegan because that's associated with being ""liberal"" and these people in particular don't want that. It's a huge factor."
nutrition,Fair point conceptually. Nutrition is still a subject that sorely understudied.
nutrition,"Well put and helpful answer, I think you’re on to something"
nutrition,"Health is a weird thing because you're never really done being healthy. There is probably always going to be more things that will further push your longevity, but as with everything in these topics, it's always a risk-reward.

Vegan life expectancy vs. omnivore life expectancy is basically the same. But life expectancy from people suffering from obesity vs. people that don't suffer from it is not the same.

So while the conversation around what things we can do to further our health is important, it is also, I would argue, more important to realize that it doesn't mean anything from the average person who just wants to try something and work with it, and as dietitians we should work with them and not against them.

I don't particularly like vegan diets, but if someone is dead-set on doing I will do my best to give them the best results, because the alternative is always worse.

And you know, in my opinion, keto can definitely be unhealthy, but it's hard for me to say that someone eating a salad and a piece of chicken breast every day is doing something horrible for their health.

We gotta learn where we can and help where we can. We have a toolbelt full of tools and we like to say ""this is the perfect hammer"" when we have screwdrivers too... or something."
nutrition,"You do eat fruit and veg in Keto. I eat more greens than ever. I’ve been on it for a year and healthier than ever. 

There’s a lot of ignorance around Keto. Look at r/Keto - if you’re interested."

nutrition,Same! I get bored
nutrition,Couldn’t agree more
nutrition,Mate do yourself a favour and get on the r/Keto sub before you do yourself some serious damage.
nutrition,Do you have a link?
nutrition,"Valid point. I don’t think I could do it to be honest, I don’t think I could absorb that complex level if information unfortunately:("
nutrition,"Maybe the choice I made there wasn't the best lol, but my point is the same.

If our body creates something in the absence of it being consumed, I don't think that necessarily = we must therefore consume it. Just from a logic perspective, I was criticizing the formulation of the argument, not the argument itself. I don't know enough about biochem, as you can see lmao, still learning."
nutrition,"I want to learn more and I’ll try to watch the video, this is a very interesting and strong position"

I’m sugar so healthy when it’s from fruit and Whole Foods, Europeans definitely ruined Inuit diets, and they are a great example of 1. Meat being ok when it isn’t processed and paired with other foods 2. Necessity teaching us about nutrition and the things our bodies are capable of. I am surrounded by a lot of pro vegan health people, my goal is open mindedness, I’ll always learning and still getting my education so hopefully things clear up for me because i do feel there is so much conflicting information. It isn’t one size fits all even though so many diets seem to be promoted as if they are."
nutrition,"&gt;Ketosis is the process of your body converting fats into energy, which produces nitrogen. 

Where did you get that idea from???

Neither fat nor carbohydrate contain any nitrogen, nitrogen is in protein. How would converting fat into ketones produce nitrogen?

And why is your body not meant to be in ketosis for long? Babies are in ketosis. Children rapidly enter ketosis. Most adults wake up in the morning with mild amounts of ketones, even those who eat lots of carbs. Endurance athletes switch to producing ketones when glycogen starts running down."
nutrition,So much confusing info in these comments
nutrition,What diet?
nutrition,"I don’t think this would be efficient, no science here but I think this would be very close to a waste of time. Better off just eating in a small surplus for say a couple months and then cutting."
nutrition,THANKS ill try that!
nutrition,"I don’t know if this is normal, I personally don’t spit that much but do know the relief your talking about especially when sick. Maybe try having water nearby and when you get the urge to spit take a sip of water? This might help if your trying to stop"
nutrition,"Sorry but this comment really is ill informed. I don’t do keto and I don’t intend to, but I have met people who have sound reasons for doing so. Firstly many people aren’t doing it for weight loss but rather health problems, especially problems with insulin resistance such as women with PCOS or people who are developing prediabetes. Secondly keto doesn’t have to = steak and fried chicken. Many people on keto are eating more vegetables than they ever have, they just tend to avoid starchy ones to prevent any issues with blood glucose. The bottom line is that they reduce their carb consumption, particularly refined carbs to help stabilise blood glucose and potentially reverse insulin resistance which in turn seems to promote inflammation and thus, disease processes in some people. There is definitely an issue with insulin resistance in modern society and while keto may be an extreme way of addressing, anecdotally it seems to be helpful for certain people."
nutrition,"Everyone wants a diet that gives them ""energy"" but it's not clear whether that is actually possible or its just a placebo.

A crap diet could potentially be harming you through fatty liver and pro-oxidant/antioxidant ratio even if you look fine on the outside.

&gt;I want my body fat % as low as possible, but also really want to put on weight.

Keep the protein ratio high. 

&gt;general advice on how I should improve my diet?

Eat a diverse range of meat and veggies, this will essentially guarantee you get enough vitamins without trying. Avoid sugar and deepfryer oils and general processed junk food. Cook with olive oil. Eat the full-fat dairy, fat isn't bad anymore. Pick up a cookbook and don't waste your time reading about nutrition, the whole field sucks and you'll only ever find controversy."
nutrition,"I think the Ketogenic diet has its place for people with say, epilepsy. I think people got a hold of it and spread information about it to make a quick buck and treat it as a fix all fad diet. There’s only really studies pointing to a lack of carbohydrates in your diet doing harm to your well-being. Although there are applications, I.E. Epilepsy, which is what it was originally intended for. You’ll find that a lot with fad diets. It’s a diet meant for a very specific medical purpose that random people make into a fad diet to make a quick buck. Although you’re free to try it if you want, I can’t tell you otherwise, I personally would advice against it. There’s just better options."
nutrition,"If you are willing to invest the time, Jason Fung has a 6-part video series on a set of lectures he did about obesity - it's called ""The aetiology of obesity"". There's a 1 hour version but I don't think it's terribly good. 

What most people miss is that people who have significant insulin resistance have a fundamental disorder that leads to hyperinsulinemia that is not resolved by normal diets. It's because their physiology is not normal. 

Because of that, the sorts of things that would work on somebody who is insulin sensitive do not work well on them. The mainstream explanation is that people just eat too much and move too little, and a) that's a very dismissive explanation and b) it clearly does not work well."
nutrition,"3/4 pound of spinach a day, a sweet potato, three roma tomatoes and half an onion chopped to make salsa or half tub hummus, lots of tortilla chips, two bananas, two oranges/small grapefruits, maybe package of berries, Kashi protein cereal with pea protein milk, ~1000cals HUEL, 2/3 Larabars, brown rice with 2/3 eggs or that sweet potato. 

This is roughly my daily intake during my work week. The standardization works for me. I eat all types of fruit, the berries get subbed for anything that was on sale. CLIF bars were once a staple but the Larabar is superior imo. Broccoli, Brussel Sprouts, Peas, Carrots, Black Beans, Bok Choy recently joined the roster, and avocado($$$)."

Hmm....

I'm assuming that you were taught that the best diet for type II was a low-fat, moderate carbohydrate diet. 

How do you reconcile that with the superior clinical results that a keto diet provides for people with type II? They lose weight and they look better from the vast majority of clinical measures."

nutrition,Everything that suffer a process is processed but not all process are equal. Common sea salt don't have nitrites and this home made cured meat looks very safe in this aspect. 😃👍🏼
nutrition,"1) your body does not *need* exogenous carbohydrates. Like you said, our bodies create the blood sugar necessary for our brains. 

2) B vitamins are ample in animals products, so there isn’t a risk of deficiency whatsoever. Fiber isn’t a nutrient, and isn’t needed in the human body at all, so I’m not sure why you listed that. Photochemical, again, aren’t nutrients; they’re beneficial to myriad of organs, but we don’t need them. 

3) the myths about saturated fats and heart health have long been debunked. It’s frightening that a near-graduate with a masters in dietetics is still being taught this bunk science."
nutrition,"Yeah, that’s the one! It’s a really cool app"
nutrition,"I'm really interested in the salting portion of this definition though. If the only carcinogenic aspect of processing meats is the addition of nitrites, but salting doesn't inherently add nitrites, then why does this and other articles go out of their way to say that ""any meat that has been preserved by \[...\] salting is processed""?"
nutrition,"You're not crazy, Fun\_Dragonfruit is completely right. Animal fats and animal protein cause a lot of damage, so keto is best done for specific health reasons and/or short-term."
nutrition,"Morningstar sausages, beyond burgers, Greek yogurt, fat free cheese,  low fat cottage cheese, egg whites, and textured vegetable protein are my go-tos. A lot of people will say beans, seitan, wheat gluten etc but the bioavailability of those protein are so low that I don't rely on those for my protein intake. Dairy and soy seem to have high absorption capabilites (if you care about your muscles)."
nutrition,"I personally would be more concerned about avoiding byproducts from plastics, industrial chemicals on clothing, and city smog than salted/preserved meats. Humans have been preserving meats for 1000s of years, but being exposed to industrial chemicals and PM 2.5 particles from exhaust are much more recent (within the last 50-100 yrs), are much more novel for our bodies to deal with (and therefore, much more dangerous)."
nutrition,"Red meat is healthy. Every single study that claims it isn't is correlational, it's impossible for these studies to be correct as the average person who eats red meat is also more likely to eat deep fried food, fast food, high sugar foods, and to smoke and drink excessively - and less likely to exercise or get proper sleep or have any healthy lifestyle practices. We evolved to eat meat, grass fed meat not hormone and glyphosate-ridden grain fed cows. A meta analysis on people eating healthy red meat the way it's meant to be doesn't exist, and if it did it would show how healthy red meat is. It's loaded with nutrients in bioavailable forms that are critical for optimal health and has a good fatty acid and amino acid profile. That doesn't say anything about keto, keto is good for people who have certain genetic markers that mean they thrive on high fat low carb diets, and even then most of them should cycle on and off it. And it's absolutely amazing for some people with mental disorders, autism, epilepsy, autoimmune issues and many other conditions."
nutrition,"I also have found the keto diet to be healthy, at least so far.  Only 1 year.  But I am thinking of migrating to Mediterranean for maintenance.  I really like that my triglycerides came down to healthy levels.  I am concerned about my LdL levels but can't find any concrete science studies."
nutrition,"All industrial cured meats have nitrite to prevent harmful bacteria. Nitrite reacts with meat amines (generated from spontaneous protein degradation) and form nitrosamines that are carcinogenic.
Home made cured meats don't have added nitrite, but smoking process can turn other types of carcinogens (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and furans)"
nutrition,"Probiotics are actual 'good' bacteria. Prebiotics are are indegestible foods (for us) which bacteria use as fuel. Probiotcs are good if you have issues coming from bad balance of bacteria, and prebiotics are great for maintaining / not letting the bacteria die off. Prebiotics are ofc best when they are actual food.

It's probably a very hit or miss thing, like rare mineral deficiencies. You probably dont need them but if you do they work excellent. You should give them a try once block out a period of no drinking and eating junk and having less stress. I personally wanted to try them out but i won't have such a period anytime soon."
nutrition,Correct answer
nutrition,"I think a lot of it has to do with our society and the desperation people have to look a certain way at any cost... It's easy to deny that higher consumption of meat + saturated fats is associated with increased risk of heart disease because as I said it's not immediate. It's not visible. You can go 40+ years living this way and then suddenly have a heart attack and need a triple bypass. But you wouldn't think to blame it on the way you've been eating. Not initially. 

When it comes to diet trends people tend to see the initial weight drop due to monitoring their portions and how they eat (in order to stick to the diet, they pay more attention to how they eat which is vital for weight loss in general) and they see the benefit of that initial weight loss and don't consider other long term consequences of basically cutting out an entire group of foods. 

I appreciate you asking these questions and taking the time to read my massive responses. I'm pretty passionate about this but a lot of people don't take the time to consider everything. 😊 Happy to share and discuss anytime OP."
nutrition,"Elimination diets were never intended for the general population. They are a response to very specific situations where they can benefit a patient. I am not the most knowledgeable on the topic so please take my opinion with a grain of salt, but unless it is medicinally necessary for your survival/wellbeing depriving yourself of your body's preferred energy source, and the micronutrients that come with it seems like a recipe for health issues later in life to me."
nutrition,The Canada food guide is ridiculous
nutrition,"Carnivore diet, strictly animal products and zero plants, put my crohn's disease into remission. I did/do IF as well to give my digestive system more of a break every day.

The diet change is what finally put five years of chronic vomiting and diarrhea to rest. I was very strict for 18 months and it saved my life. I'm chronically ill and constantly getting blood work and I was fine the whole time. 

These days I eat plants daily again but my diet is still focused heavily on animal protein at every meal.

Not saying one diet is healthier than the other, but for sure plants were trying to kill me and meat healed me.  

There are a few MDs and people who work with this stuff professionally who support these kinds of diets. Then again there are MDs who don't vaccinate and won't prescribe birth control to unmarried women, so like, take everything you hear with a grain of salt."
nutrition,"I recommend reading A Case For Keto by Gary Taubes. You can also find him on you tube, it will answer a lot of questions for you. He is a journalist that had been investigating keto for a very long time. It has changed my mind about keto as I recognize what carbohydrates do to my insulin levels/ response. This book isn't a diet book but a book about facts and I am so glad I read it."
nutrition,Bumbed to hear that. Nutrition seems like a number one factor for health.
nutrition,"Thank you for taking time out of your day to comment on my comment. I feel that it is only fair I do the same but with less Ad hominem attacks. B-12 is the only nutrient I have ever lacked by being plant-based. I have never denied that. I do not need to take a multivitamin, a plant-based diet REALLY does tick 99% of the boxes for nutrition. The original post is asking for a way to get a multivitamin out of a diet, this works to target nutritional goals for many people. I would also recommend speaking with an RD if someone wanted an individualized plan. All diet followers can find something to hate about an opposing dieter. That’s just life. I speak from experience, education, and I do not use attacks as a way to prove a point. Thank you again, for your thoughts and concern."
nutrition," So, I’m aware that smoothies are controversial in regards to health/weight loss. I’m curious because I’ve seen several nutritionists claim that liquid calories are the worst and liquid doesn’t offer enough satiety for daily consumption as in place of a meal. With that being said I hate the taste of veggies on their own and have regularly been drinking smoothies. I keep it to one fruit (usually wild blueberries), spinach/kale, cucumbers, carrots, unsweetened almond milk, sprinkle of hemp hearts and two scoops of vegan protein power. Sometimes I add a tiny portion of avocado. I consume this for breakfast every morning and keep my other two meals light. I haven’t run into any issues, I’ve been feeling great and dropping weight steadily. Is it just high sugar smoothies that are looked down upon or does anyone here really struggle counting liquid as a meal replacement?"

nutrition,I lost 60 lbs on keto. Took about 2 years . Now I still don't eat carbs but I'm not as strict as before. I'll have a burger with a whole wheat bun every know and then or a pizza. Just not often. Like once a week.
nutrition,"Same here, I started with dirty keto which was very bacon-and-eggs but you very quickly lose a taste for them.  So I started incorporating leafy greens which I have never paid much attention to.  Keto really requires a lot of veggie fiber to be done healthy, it definitely increased my consumption, and that has carried over to my non-keto time.  But I agree with the overall thread concepts here, that keto is a blunt instrument in the wrong hands and that fad yo-yo dieting isn't the right use for it (or any diet, frankly).  I have severe anxiety and depression and keto helps a ton with that, which is primarily why I use it.  It's like being on a drug, it's a whole different state.  But that's not to say I would live my life on it."
nutrition,I really appreciate your response. I was sent some links showing that heart health was not affected by meat and I really didn’t buy it. I think people are in denial maybe?

nutrition,"I am 2 weeks away from finishing my master's degree in nutrition and Dietetics. 

I do not support ketogenic diets unless medically necessary (also for those refering to diets for epilepsy, it was the modified Atkins diet that was designed for it ...) 

My three main reasons for not supporting Keto are the following: 
1. You body needs carbohydrates to function and will create them in different ways (gluconeogenesis using protein from your muscles or converting fat) 
2. You will miss vital nutrients in your diet (namely, B vitamins, fibre, and phytochemicals) 
3. On a long term basis not only is Keto hard to sustain, it has also played an impact on heart health specifically with the increase in saturated fats and decrease in overall fibre) 

While you might be able to work around some of these roadblocks, if you're simply doing Keto for weight loss you're more likely to deprive your body of necessary components that keep it strong and healthy... These deficits will not show right away but over a longer period of time...nothing in nutrition is instant. 

Do what you will with your own body, but I will always recommend a well balanced, portion monitored diet for overall health and wellbeing. 

If you're in need of a specialized diet long term you should be followed closely by a dietitian and team of doctors to monitor for any complications if they develop so you can better mediate them before they become a problem. 

I hope that helps! :)"
nutrition,Hmm.  I am not a big egg fan myself but not for any reason.   I love chocolate Easter eggs tho.  (I know... not a multivitamin)
nutrition,"Yup. Glycogen, our body’a carbohydrate reserves in muscle and the liver, hold about 4 times its own weight in water. On a very low carb diet, these glycogen stores are depleted to supply the brain with glucose, and the water weight is lost along with it. As soon as a person eats carbs again, this glycogen and it’s associated water weight comes back. That’s why if someone is on keto they lose a ton of weight in a few days, and gain it back as soon as they eat any carbs. This is why some people think they can’t lose weight and eat carbs, but they aren’t even losing fat tissue on low carb diets either. 


Some people have lost a ton of weight following keto long term, and there have been studies that show keto is effective at helping some people with epilepsy. But there haven’t been enough long term studies of the health effects of keto to know if it’s safe to follow for long periods of time. And any diet that effectively eliminates a food group is a bad diet. Diets this restrictive are difficult to follow long term, can lead to disordered eating behavior, and can make a person feel physically sluggish and run down."
nutrition,"i understand plant protein for vegans but it is not better than whey. animal based proteins such as whey protein are easier to digest and have higher biological value (likely because our entire ancestry consumed meat). Also with plant proteins/diets you need to consume more calories to get the same amount of protein. Look into creatine: research shows that its most beneficial for ppl who dont consume meat since there is no way to get adequate amounts through plant based sources (even getting a 5g dose regularly through a carnivore diet is hard) ill leave research on animal vs plant and creatine below.

&gt;However, when the corn oil was replaced by hydrogenated coconut oil the tumor incidence never exceeded 8 percent, while in most groups it was zero.

https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b44f/0f82cbb7d9473ac99c386626d22d4200e395.pdf

&gt;Thus the substitution of hydrogenated coconut oil for corn oil definitely inhibited tumor induction...

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02531379

&gt;Experiments with 10 different fats and oils fed at the 20% level indicated that unsaturated fats enhance the yield of adenocarcinomas more than saturated fats.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7285004

&gt;Thus, diets high in unsaturated fat appear to promote pancreatic carcinogenesis in the azaserine-treated rat while a diet high in saturated fat failed to show a similar degree of enhancement of pancreatic carcinogenesis.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6577233

&gt;...tumors grew to a larger size in C3H mice fed the 10% corn oil diet (with...60% linoleate content) than in those fed the 10% hydrogenated oil diet (without linoleate). The C3H mice fed diets with 1% linoleic acid developed significantly larger tumors than did those fed 1% oleic acid...

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6587159

&gt;...mice fed a 10% corn oil (CO) diet, which contains linoleate, than in those fed 10% hydrogenated cottonseed oil ( HCTO ), a diet free of the polyunsaturated fatty acid...Both incidence and growth rate of tumors...were greater in mice fed diets containing either 0.3, 1, or 10% CO than in those fed 10% HCTO.

&gt;...animals fed the HF safflower and corn oil diets exhibited enhanced mammary tumor yields when compared to animals fed HF olive or coconut oil diets...

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/107358

&gt;These results show that a certain amount of polyunsaturated fat, as well as a high level of dietary fat, is required to promote mammary carcinogenesis.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6782319

&gt;...the addition of 3% ethyl linoleate (an ethyl ester of a polyunsaturated fatty acid) increased the tumor yield to about twice that in rats fed either the high-saturated fat diet or a low-fat diet.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/416226

&gt;The differences in tumor incidence suggest that carcinogenesis was enhanced by the polyunsaturated fat diet during the promotion stage of carcinogenesis.

&gt;Enhancement of mammary carcinogenesis in the high-corn oil diet group is detectable in most of the parameters studied.

The following study found this effect to be tissue-specific:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1544140

&gt;An inverse correlation...was observed between papilloma number and level of LA; however, there was little difference in tumor incidence...To determine whether this inverse correlation...was due to species differences or organ-model differences, a mammary carcinogenesis experiment was performed...Tumor appearance was delayed in the 0.8% LA diet group, and a positive dose-response relationship between dietary LA and mammary-tumor incidence was observed. These studies suggest that the effect of dietary LA on tumor development is target tissue specific rather than species specific.

The following studies got unusual results regarding cancer incidence and also measured lifespan:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25313149

&gt;Among the CR groups, survival was increased ( p &lt; .05) in the CR lard group compared to either the CR Soy or CR fish groups...Calorie restriction by itself (CR soy vs Control) or dietary fat composition in the CR groups did not significantly alter cancer incidence...

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10198915

&gt;...mistol seed oil (MO) containing 25% of a-linolenic acid (ALA), evening primrose oil (EPO) enriched in gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and corn oil (CO)...corn oil feeding slowed down most of the tumor growth parameters, as did the EPO diet. MO also showed antitumor activity. Olein feeding, which induces an essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD), increased the incidence and the multiplicity of metastases...The diets containing MO, EPO oils as well as those supplemented  with olein, significantly prolonged the survival time...The survival time of the CO group did not differ from the controls...

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9585060

&gt;In both mammary gland tumors, n-6 fatty acid-rich lipids formulae, containing GLA and linoleic acid, were not tumor promoters. On the contrary, both exhibited anticancer activity.

Lifespans of the various groups were: control &lt; corn oil &lt; olein &lt; evening primrose oil.

The following study has somewhat different methodology and involved rabbits:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14473680

&gt;...significantly larger numbers of tumor nodules in...the butter-group than in the sugar-group. The corn oil-group had numbers of tumor nodules intermediate in respect to the other two groups.

Also, 20 rabbits died in the corn oil group, compared to 16 in the butter group and 14 in the sugar group.

Compare this to stearic acid, a saturated fatty acid, which is anticarcinogenic:

&gt;Dietary stearate reduces human breast cancer metastasis burden in athymic nude mice.

I find [this study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/16546628.2017.1305193) very interesting. 

This was a short term test comparing the FFQ approach with the dietary record approach, which is the absolute best conditions for FFQ, and the results were not very good; just to pick an example, the FFQ said that women ate an average of 280 g/day of fruit while the dietary record said it was only 180 g/day.

I would generally eat a pretty big dinner at the end of the day. I did my last one about a week ago when I had just gotten my blood glucose monitor. Looking at what happened to my glucose when I fasted versus when I ate persuaded me that fasting was not helpful to me, at this time. My postprandial glucose that day was my highest reading, along with the morning after the fast. So yeah, it was not working for me.

I do have some fat (BMI about 25) and so I'm now putting some effort into losing weight, and am feeling more motivated for that than I was when it was just about vanity.

Regarding dairy - healthy fats over less healthy fats, and it really comes down to how much and how often, which will differ based on your genes and current body status. Regarding grains - NO, many are processed, and even whole grains are still very high in carbs, which break down to sugars. Sure, sugar is great for energy, but not ideal for true health or longevity. Think about Keto diet - main focus is low carb, you can eat tones of veggies and clean meats, and people lose a lot of weight fairly quickly.

Lots of peas, corn, peppers, salads, sometimes soups, and even then its mostly vegetable. I’ll have tolled oats with some honey and blueberries. I try to change it up so I don’t get bored but keep it as healthy as possible."
nutrition,"I wasn’t claiming that, I was saying that the idea that we can only healthily consume foods that our ancestors ate isn’t true, because we have a microbiome that has a large role in our digestion, and that micro biome evolves pretty quickly.

The example about sushi mentioned that the issue with North Americans’ ability to digest seaweed is because nori is cooked and the bacteria is dead."
nutrition,That's what I use as well. Have a nice day.
nutrition,"And another one:

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-guts-microbiome-changes-diet/

“For hunters and gatherers, diet could be altered quickly and with little transition—weeks of nuts and seeds might be broken up by a sudden influx of meat from a successful hunt—and the ability to rapidly change the microbiome would ensure maximum nutrient absorption from even the most unfamiliar foods”

Your gut bacteria determines your ability to get nutrition from certain foods, and your micro biome can change rapidly. 

Our bodies needs a basic set of nutrients and vitamins, yes, but our ability to extract them from food is affected by our gut bacteria. This has good and bad effects on our health depending on the food and depending on the bacteria we have, but it’s absolutely a vital part of it."
nutrition,"No matter how synergistic it is, the human body reproduces on a **much longer time scale** than bacteria. It's not separate, but it is also not *identical*, and *you* are treating the question as if the human body can be treated as though it were identical to the microbiome. It cannot. Your illustration only demonstrates that a dysfunctional microbiome cannot reliably produce the proper outputs that the human body will need, it *does not* and *cannot* demonstrate that just because the composition of the microbiome can change then the human body must be adaptable to whatever outputs the microbiome produces after that change. Your *very own example* demonstrates that that is *not the case*!"
nutrition,Amazing choice.
nutrition,"I think a lot of the dialogue around nutrition is usually evidence based, but a lot of the evidence is contradictory or cherry-picked to support a specific diet. It’s in your best interest to explore them all, do your research and learn to filter out the ones with inconclusive or insufficient evidence to support their claim. Stick to your basics and teach yourself to do your own unbiased research. Even the best “unbiased” podcast is going to have a few episodes that aren’t as high in quality evidence wise."
nutrition,"Here’s one fun example of gut bacteria evolving to change how people get nutrition from food:

nutrition,"Also saturated fat are very stable for cooking, they don't oxidize easily. Vegetable oil was introduced to human diet in the last 100 years or so, while butter, coconut or olive oil have been consumed for centuries in many societies around the world. So avoid vegetable oils like the plague."
nutrition,Liver?

nutrition,"Yeah I have a lot olive oil, coconut oil, and avocado oil"
nutrition,"There are infinite ways to eat a varied diet which cover all nutrients.

If you want to keep it simple, just have one or two weekly servings of organ meats and you're fine."
nutrition,Red meat isn’t too high in calories and if you eat the fat actually cuts your hunger allowing less calories. The red meat is bad science has been largely shown to be bad science as they included processed meats in their definition of meat.
nutrition,"I know this sounds vague, but considering there is never a specific right answer with nutrition, just focus on variety and adequacy in all food groups and avoid processed foods. If you do this you should absolutely be able to meet all the vitamins and minerals you need!"
nutrition,"Avoid refined vegetable oil such as soybean oil, corn oil, canola oil and a few more."
nutrition,"Saturated fat from coconut oil or pasture raised animals are not bad, in fact they are one of the better oils. Olive and avocado oil are great as well. What bad are refined vegetable oil (linoleic acid)."
nutrition,Broccoli
nutrition,Pharmaceutical grade fish oil and exercise decreasing carbs.
nutrition,Plant based diet...
nutrition,"You’re acting like the human body is separate from the micro biome. It’s a synergistic system. 

Example: cabbage, blackberries, beets, garlic, and apples are typically considered “healthy,” old foods, right?

Well, they’re horrible for people with FODMAP sensitivities because they don’t have the right gut bacteria to digest these foods.

Your gut bacteria determines your ability to extract nutrition from the food for your body in a way that is beneficial for your body.

Your gut bacteria affects what foods will be healthy/not healthy for you."
nutrition,it is super difficult to get adequate protein on a daily basis on a veg diet. are you opposed to taking whey protein supplements? look into the literature on whey. i believe it’s one of the few things worth supplementing after creating.
nutrition,"Honestly my introductory nutrition textbook for college (I'm a Dietetics student) had the most accurate info in one place. It's Nutrition Concepts and Controversies by Frances Sizer and Ellie Whitney. I'm sure libraries and places like thriftbooks would have this book or other nutrition textbooks full of good info (obvs more recent books will have updated info). My textbook in particular is great because it helps break down creating a healthy eating pattern; gives all info on DRI and UL for macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, and water; gets you thinking critically about nutrition and what you can do for your own diet; and outlining pros , cons, and controversies of popular diet trends."
nutrition,"Just eat based on the basics. You probably know what fruit and vegetables are nutritious and what meats are lean and what meats contain more fat. Take that knowledge and run with it you will find what you like and what makes you feel good externally and internally. You can google all day finding new ways to try to eat, diet etc... it depends on your activity level and the foods you enjoy eating. I noticed you keep going back to science. May I ask why? Are you just trying to gain overall knowledge on nutrition or trying to find what suits you best?"
nutrition,"I mean honestly yeah it’s gotten pretty confusing. but there is a general agreement that whole, unprocessed foods are and will always be better (at least most of the time). so like even with our shitty sugar &amp; trans fat filled diet, people in developed nations are living what? 70? 80? 90? even 100 years not being uncommon.. like look you’re bound to dying anyway. eat whole foods, have treats in moderation and imho you’ll be fine. also some foods might have a benefit for this or that but a negative effect on this other thing. health is a big word and it’s not so black and white in the sense of “this good eat this bad avoid at all costs or it’s the end of the world”."
nutrition,"From what I can see, most ""diets"" (south beach, atkins, IF) are essentially about caloric restriction anyway. Ideally we average about what our metabolic rate + exercise is, which means excess calories some days and insufficient on other days. The only diet I've seen that can hit this is roughly paleo, but so long as it's not to heavy on red meat and the plate, on average, has a reasonable spread (ie not the same thing day after day)."
nutrition,Thanks I’ll check out that website! What’s your personal diet like?
nutrition,"As a rule of thumb, all oils are bad. Olive oil is considered one of the better ones. However, it still has saturated fat, which is bad. Plus, even if you’re not older and concerned with heart health, oil is unnecessary added calories. Think how some people might say, I don’t drink my calories. Well, oil is like drinking your calories. Coconut is one of the absolute worst. I highly recommend nutritionfacts.org He does some good videos about all sorts of foods and breaks down the research both good and bad."
nutrition,Green smoothies! That’s what I started. It’s spinach/kale with celery and then your choice of fruit. Every single morning. Eat less junk food and control stress and exercise. You should notice a difference
nutrition,Rise bars (particularly the almond/honey ones) are pretty good!
nutrition,Exercise.
nutrition,Yeah non processed is the key. Real foods. I’d say caloric restriction is good for us every now and then too by what science I’ve read on it helps clean out cells that are damaged etc
nutrition,This has nothing to do with his point...
nutrition,"&gt;The human body does not evolve without the gut bacteria 

Yes, but the human body also does not evolve at the same rate as the gut bacteria. 

&gt;And my point is that we don’t know what that optimized slurry is. 

Not entirely correct: we know within parameters what the optimal inputs are, and we know that the outputs are different dependent upon the inputs. 

&gt;But it makes zero sense to think that our digestion as a while hasn’t evolved since cavemen times, because gut bacteria does so much of the digestion 

It actually doesn't even matter if the gut bacteria does 100% of the digestion (which it doesn't) because the human body does 100% of the utilization of the output! Yes, *technically* human digestion *as a whole* has changed significantly, but *human nutritional needs* have **not**, the part that has changed - the gut bacteria - is *the least important part*! 

&gt;What I’m saying is that we don’t know the answer for certain, but bold claims like “we can only optimally digest what our ancestors 30,000 years back did” isn’t telling the whole pictures, because it’s completely ignoring the role our gut bacteria takes in our digestive system 

The fact that the gut bacteria are so adaptable *does not indicate* that the human body is that adaptable, and for any human, the inputs to the human body are more important than the inputs to the microbiome."
nutrition,"Honestly I just try to eat fewer processed foods, watch my portion sizes, and go natural when I can. I'm not too picky."
nutrition,"I think we probably agree on the basics. You just lost me when you seemed to not understand that good diets are usually high in carbs or fat (high carb is not a good option for most people was your exact comment) and there is a choice to make, I wouldn’t eat high in both as that seems to not be healthy."
nutrition,"Greek yogurt with frozen berries or cottage cheese. I also love any type of salad, Ben and Jerry’s, and mrs Vickies salt and vinegar chips"
nutrition,The nutrition advice is pretty good IMO. They hit a lot of important topics that I don't hear a lot like reverse dieting and focusing on the individual rather than blanket statements.
nutrition,Great idea! I never thought of this!
nutrition,"Just swig that last gulp down! 

I noticed ours are a lot smoothies after we got a higher end blender. I tend to add a lot of spices to ours so don’t mind that final sip as I know it’s saturated. You could possibly play around with different milk types or perhaps stir the spices into some hot water before adding to the rest to help them dissolve. Good luck!"
nutrition,"Building muscle is a physical act that is easier said than done because it needs many variables to be in harmony, both in terms of training and diet.

nutrition,"Interesting, I’ll look more into it. Been using olive oil recently. Always thought it was healthy?"
nutrition,"Yeah it's a huge issue that has gone strangly underrapreciated by mainstream nutrition who keep saying ""polyunsaturated fats are good"" without considering context

Some people are working on it though 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7254282/

&gt;Exposure of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-rich culinary oils (COs) to high temperature frying practices generates high concentrations of cytotoxic and genotoxic lipid oxidation products (LOPs) via oxygen-fueled, recycling peroxidative bursts. These toxins, including aldehydes and epoxy-fatty acids, readily penetrate into fried foods and hence are available for human consumption; therefore, they may pose substantial health hazards. Although previous reports have claimed health benefits offered by the use of PUFA-laden COs for frying purposes, these may be erroneous in view of their failure to consider the negating adverse public health threats presented by food-transferable LOPs therein. When absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) system into the systemic circulation, such LOPs may significantly contribute to enhanced risks of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), e.g. , cancer, along with cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Herein, we provide a comprehensive rationale relating to the public health threats posed by the dietary ingestion of LOPs in fried foods."

nutrition,"6.5mmol is an extremely high LDL and suggests a genetic problem. I don't think diet got you to that place, nor would it be able to reduce it by that much.

It's important to remember that there is more to cholesterol than just the LDL number. The foods most strongly associated with heart disease are sugar, white bread and transfats which all lower HDL and contribute to inflammation. 

&gt;dietary cholesterol myths or facts

Eggs are the highest source of dietary cholesterol and are broadly not associated with heart disease. Your body mostly makes its own cholesterol.

Here's a good review of the totality of evidence relating nutrition to cardiometabolic health

https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/circulationaha.115.018585


For the sake of answering the question, a good way to lower cholesterol is to catch a dangerous infection. The inflammatory process wipes out lipoprotein content as presumably it is being used as fuel for the inflamed tissues to fight back. This might be why low cholesterol in the population is paradoxically associated with higher rates of death."

nutrition,"Yes, and don’t add any oil or ketchup or anything like that. I’d cut the potatos out and replace them with other vegetables. And if you mix em up on a daily basis you’ll get everything you need. Be sure yo add spinach and tomatos in there. Spinach salad would be great for example."

nutrition,"Any deepfried food can be assumed to be quite toxic. The oils have been heeated for hours-days-months and substantilly degraded into a range of lipid oxidation products.

Avocado oil is a more thermally stable oil but I'd still not want to eat it if it has been heavily reused. If you fried potatoes yourself in fresh oil I'd expect it to be quite healthy."

nutrition,"So theoretically a plate that consists of veggies (broccoli, carrots, etc) + some type of protein (beef, salmon, chicken) + some type of carb (potato, brown rice, sweet potato, etc) would be relatively all you need?"
nutrition,"Your first reply buddy. Now you’re replying to someone else thinking it’s me. I said what are you smoking because you are contradicting the whole sentence I was disagreeing with where you said people don’t do well on high fat or high carb by then saying obviously plants are high carb while you’re saying plants are good. (I’m not disagreeing that people can go very well on a plant based diet) 

you seem really confused about ben about what you have said hence “what are you smoking?”"
nutrition,"I would say this, but I’d nix the cheese and keep the occasional salmon, chicken, turkey; and/or venison or buffalo if you can get it."

nutrition,"No I’m not. There are many areas where vegetables do not grow and I’m actually from there genetically so even that weak ass attempt to discredit this point doesn’t work.

I don’t know why people try so hard to attack any science that says yes humans can survive without plants. People are so dogmatic about this one point they refuse to admit that you can chose between carbs or fats as fuel. 

I think if you go for just meat and fats vitamin C is the biggest issue.

If you go for just plants there are Similar issues with B and amino acids from protein being difficult.

But both have solutions if you wanted to go either way.

I myself eat a mostly animal based supplemented with some low fodmap vegetables because of a disease that doesn’t allow me to eat a lot of types of vegetables and grains are very bad for causing worse symptoms.

nutrition,"This is a bit of hyperbole honestly... We know exactly how most of the vitamins and minerals work in human health because when humans don't get enough of them they often develop very observable and specific illnesses which have been studied extensively. B vitamin deficiencies have been studied for over 100 years for example. Laboratory experiments have helped to elucidate the chemical reactions that they participate in to support normal human physiology. The Linus Pauling Institute is a decently organized resource that covers the basics down to the minutia on micronutrients, food groups, and the role of nutrition in health and human diseases.

 When people have this conversation they are often looking at it from an angle that asks, what foods or diet should I follow to be ""healthy."" This has led to in groups around diets where people are protective of what they eat because they feel like the information they have is the ""truth"" and therefore others must be wrong."
nutrition,Good
nutrition,Wow ❤️
nutrition,"Thanks for this, I always thought it was Michael Palin who said this 😂"
nutrition,TLDR; Moderation is key
nutrition,TLDR; Nothing is bad for you?
nutrition,"It isn’t. Those not eating meat typically eat more plants containing iron so it makes up for the loss, and eating them with vitamin c increases absorption. Moderation is void of meaning as people use it to eat whatever they want."
nutrition,"honestly nutrition comes down to what best works for your body. if you listened to all diets on what’s good for you, you would have a plate with nothing on it. your body may not react as well to dairy as mine does. so try the elimination diet where you try what works for you and if it does it does and if it doesn’t it doesnt"
nutrition,"Thanking you. 

I just don’t like how people associate certain foods with being bad and they cause you to be fat. 

Eating in a calorie surplus makes you gain weight/ body fat. 
Not the food itself. 
People just can’t help themselves and then look to blame something. 

To your question on iron and haemoglobin. 
Hmm tricky one. 
It depends on your current nutrition. 

You can get iron and that from red meat which has greater quantities. But you can also get it from beans, nuts etc. Just in smaller quantities. 

I never really looked into it to be honest. 
Myself personally. I eat meat and mix that with carbs and fats. A lot coming from good quality sources. 

The only thing I ever recommend to vegans / vegetarians is this. 
 
Make sure you are sufficient in protein and make sure to get a supplement with b12. (Which can only come from animal products) 

I always think of food as fuel. 
You wouldn’t fill a f1 car with cheap fuel, so why would you treat your body any different."
nutrition,"Human metabolism and digestion is complex and multifactorial, so it is nearly impossible to do ""perfect"" studies. Take into account that food production is for profit, that food has always had moral, emotional, and cultrual values attached, it means that it is very difficult to unravel what the ""right"" thing is for our bodies. Nutritional studies are inherently imperfect due to the difficulty in holding huge, systemic studies where people's intake is controlled: study subjects may lie or fall out of compliance or not track something well, etc. Add that to funding by people with a conflict of interest and an industry that wants to warp even good (if imperfect) science into something saleable...it makes sense that there's a mess."
nutrition,"Dude. Didn’t I say you can survive just not thrive? And that your life expectancy will take a hit due to the protective nature of those foods? And congratulations you’ll get enough vitamin C to avoid scurvy, if you are very careful to include specific sources regularly. I have never seen any published research that maintains the human body does better without fiber. But, I don’t really care enough about your diet to continue this. Eat what you want. I just maintain that eating exclusively meat will keep your diet from being optimal. Not to mention enjoyable. But you do you."
nutrition,"Recommend @guthealthmd on instagram Dr Will Bulzewitz, has a great book Fiber Fueled"
nutrition,"Personally I’m a vegan(not for health) but I like to keep a diet that’s pretty healthy but allows leeway for a cookie or chips here and there. I believe we should indulge every now and then so we don’t binge on these foods when we’re emotional. 

Also, while I don’t believe the amount of meat Americans eat is healthy, moderation isn’t bad. The best diets around the world are the blue zones where several people live to their 100s such as Italians and Okinawa. They are not only healthier, but happier."

Once it comes to applying the science everyone has their own ""religion"" and by my estimation everyone has to make one and the best thing to do is learn as much as possible, so that the way you apply it to your practical real life  situation is as complete as possible.

No one wants to give you the revolutionary answer to your health for free or be 100% honest about how much their advice would help you. 

I think learning about what to eat is something personal that you need to really dive into for yourself. Don't ask others what makes you feel good and energetic. Eat it, write down what it is, and move on. You need to find what makes things work for you. 

If you're interested. You can also look into time restricted eating, long term fasting, and the snake diet.

You still have given no sources, so I’m pretty done this conversation."
nutrition,What????
nutrition,"Med student with an interest in nutrition here.  It is absolutely insane how much the food industry has been allowed to influence our nutritional recommendations.  For example, because of a huge push from the dairy industry, we are recommended to take in much more dairy than is necessary, which can have detrimental effects in the long run.  I think in terms of “diets”, the DASH diet or the Mediterranean diet is best, which emphasizes whole grains, fruits and veggies, low saturated fats, limiting red meat etc.  basically, the simplest solutions are usually the best, and if you find yourself jumping through a crazy amount of hoops to fulfill your diet, it’s probably not going to be sustainable long term.

I think someone already mentioned looking at Google scholar for articles, and I def agree that’s a good place to start.  When reading, also pay attention to the sample size, any conflicts of interest, and there should be a section where studies have to list their limitations."

Both protein and fat are structural in your body; protein not only builds muscles but it key to enzymes, hormones, antibodies, etc. Fat is used in membranes, hormones, signaling, gene transcription, and it's a major part of our nervous system - our brains are about 60% fat.

Carbs, on the other hand, are only used for energy."

nutrition,"Not one food, but a rotation of a few foods could be sufficient"
nutrition,"Check out precision nutrition. I love the term the use - nutrition agnostic. There is no one best way of eating, nutrition is really about a combination of numerous factors, not just macros and micros. Their approach and considerations are pretty good."
nutrition,"The sad truth is that nutritional research is a hot mess and has been for the past 30 years. 

Upton Sinclair said, ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.""

There are numerous people with differing agendas, and there is simply a huge amount of money at stake for the various food industries, particularly the processed food ones. They are working hard to support research that helps them sell their foods and denigrate research that doesn't.

Add onto that the number of people who have philosophical or religious agendas.

My personal approach is really three things...

The first is to look at the clinical evidence we have on how diet affects people. There are at least 10s of thousands of diet trials out there, and while they all have issues, they are, to me, our best source of data. How does a specific diet work when humans eat it? 

I guess the sub-item here is to ignore observational evidence in general; it's just not worth spending time on it for what I think are some really obvious reasons. 

The second is to look at mechanism, and that's all about whether people making claims have a reasonable theory around what they are saying - does what they are saying align with what we understand about biochemistry and physiology? Just to pick an idea, if you want to lose weight during exercise, is it a good idea to eat a carby snack before your workout? Does that make sense from what we know about biochemistry and physiology?

Unfortunately, that takes an investment in time as reading papers and learning the biochemistry is not a simple or quick task.

Third, be wary of zealots. Zealots are sometimes right but the attitude doesn't come with investigation of alternatives. 

\&gt; Everyone is speculating about ancestral eating, is there any concrete proof on how they actually ate and behaved? 

The anthropology around this is fairly interesting and I think the answer is ""yes""; we have some good data on both what ancestral people ate and what indigenous people ate before civilization showed up and changed that. 

The answer is that they ate a wide variety of things, but we know that they didn't eat refined grains, refined sugars, and seed oils."
nutrition,"Cool. Worked out great for these people.

nutrition,"Did... did you just assume they were credible because of the place they were from? I don’t know how to tell you this, but not a single one of these articles says fresh fruit is bad. Sorry it took so long to respond, I was doing the reading you clearly didn’t do.

I swapped out the youtube hyperlinks for the links directly from the page of each article.

Glycates Hb more than glucose: https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/128/9/1442/4722474

“Free fructose, in the monosaccharide form, is found naturally in honey and some fruits (figs, dates, grapes, apples and berries)” The first sentence mentions free fructose in fruits and doesn’t touch upon them for the rest of the article. They are referring to manufactured HFS and HFCS fructose in food products, not fresh fruit. They do mention dietary fructose effects on diabetics, but that doesn’t go for the general population.

Skin Aging: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2020/7145656/

This article is almost entirely about glucose and galactose. When they mention fructose, it’s in reference to fructose-induced oxidative stress, which big surprise, is a result of excessive consumption of fructose. Not from your daily recommended serving of fruit.

Fruct raises Triglycerides: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3513615/  

Again in reference to those with diabetes. In fact, in the sources for this,​ there is an article about fructose not causing increased triglyceride blood concentrations when replacing glucose.

Fruct causes Metabolic problems:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2684484/

This one is about fructose-sweetened beverages, not your daily recommended amount of fresh fruit.

Fruct raises Trig's: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19403641/

This one is about fructose overconsumption, literally in the title, not you​r daily recommended amount of fresh fruit.

Fruct &amp; Insulin Resist:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2673878/

Again, about fructose-sweetened beverages, *not your daily recommended amount of fresh fruit.*

Fruct &amp; Fatty Liver: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168827808001645

“We hypothesize that increased fructose consumption contributes to the development of NAFLD” so... yeah, not about your daily recommended amount of fresh fruit.

Fruct &amp; NAFLD:  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28273805/

Literally the first sentence, “Among various factors, such as an unhealthy diet or a sedentarity lifestyle, excessive fructose consumption is known to favor nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)” AGAIN in reference to overconsumption, combined with other risk factors. Not. your. daily. recommended. amount. of. fresh. fruit.

Fruct &amp; Insulin Sensitivity: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27194405/​

Mentions effects of fructose supplementation, which is fatty liver and insulin sensitivity as a result of *excessive caloric intake/increased energy intake*. 

Fruct &amp; Appetite: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23280226/​

First sentence of the abstract, again, “Increases in fructose consumption have paralleled the increasing prevalence of obesity, and high-fructose diets are thought to promote weight gain and insulin resistance.”
Overconsumption.

Fruct &amp; Leptin Resist:  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18703413/

“It has been suggested that increased fructose intake is associated with obesity. We hypothesized that chronic fructose consumption causes leptin resistance, which subsequently may promote the development of obesity in response to a high-fat diet.”
Not daily recommended amount of fresh fruit.

Stop Fruct &amp; Incr Insulin Sensitivity: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21418711/​

“These data suggest that fructose is the bioactive component of a HF/high-sugar diet that is essential for the induction of leptin resistance.” I don’t even know why he twisted this article so hard, fructose being a bioactive component of a *high fructose diet* is just such shocking news to everyone. But again, I gotta highlight, this article is in reference to overconsumption.

...

Not to mention the title of the video: “Fruit is BAD?”

So yeah, another misleading quack YouTube doctor. I can’t tell if he’s the one bending articles to fit his bullshit and you’re just repeating it or if you completely misinterpreted everything yourself. Because he mentions in the description that a lot of his reasoning is about excess consumption, yet titles his video something that clickbaity and gives people a completely false idea.

Fructose, like anything else in the world, is bad in excess. Nobody disagrees with that. But saying that regular fruit intake is bad for you is just flat out wrong.

nutrition,"Yeah but the links actually have to support the claims. All his references are about fructose consumption as a whole and you can't infer anything about the supposed ""dangers"" of fruit based on those studies (hint: most people's fructose comes from sweetened drinks and other sources of added sugar). There is literally zero research linking fruit consumption to liver disease, and in fact, it [appears to be protective](https://jech.bmj.com/content/74/12/1035). There was even a [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25099548/) where *higher* fructose intake was beneficial, but it was in a population that had high fruit consumption and comparatively fewer added sugars."

All current research points to a plant-heavy diet as the better way to avoid illness. The reason the situation seems confused is that the meat lobby and Big Food are sponsoring studies, and spreading news items, claiming that low carb is healthier or that 'everything is fine in moderation'.

nutrition,"This is true, but it doesn't really extrapolate to diet advice. The body has desaturase enzymes exactly for that purpose of turning saturated fats into monounsaturated fats to maintain a certain level of membrane fluidity. The body is also continuously creating MUFA+SFA from carbs too so I don't think this system would ever get strained even if a person really did eat a very high SFA diet.

Most fatty foods contain a mix of SFA and MUFA so it would be hard to design a diet of pure saturated fat. But I think the monounsaturated fats in olive oil are good to eat so I'm not going to test it out."

The other thing is that the powder I have is a blend of 14 different mushrooms, most of which I've never seen fresh anywhere (chaga, reishi, etc) but yet which have long been used medicinally and are beneficial to add to the diet. But I also keep shitake mushroom powder around if I want that particular flavor, or I have a dish I want to use a large amount in, since it's far cheaper than the powder blend.

nutrition,"&gt; Additionally, the evidence does not support the whole “lower your omega 6 intake to have a better omega 3:6 ratio” as much as it supports just increasing your omega 3 consumption via oily fish. Omega 3 competes for the same transport mechanisms as omega 6, but omega 3 has a much higher affinity, which is the mechanistic plausibility to having a benefit of just increasing omega 3 intake without worrying about omega 6 intake so much.

There is some truth here but I'd say it's more nuanced than that. The researchers in the area seem to broadly agree that reducing omega 6 intake will increase omega 3 incorporation into membranes. But the absolute intake of omega 3 is definitely the stronger variable.

nutrition,"I think its important to take into account the risk in taking these kinds of supplements.  Your GI tract has evolved to process resveratrol in tiny amounts in the skin of grapes, packaged with a plethora of other compounds.  Taking it isolated as a supplement might not have the long-term safety we think it does.  There could very well be an adverse effect which would only give you symptoms years down the line, at which point the data will be too noisy to pick up the cause. 

I think a lot of supplements with synthetic molecules or high dose extracts might very well damage something somewhere, but because we ingest and are exposed to so many chemicals it is impossible to isolate anything as a cause.

Your body is an extremely complex system which evolved over millions of years, and the little creatures doing the heavy lifting in your gut perhaps the last few thousand years.  To stay on the safe side I try to limit supplements to stuff my ancestors mightve encountered, the chance your body will be able to process them and derive net benefit is so much higher."

However, there could be a risk in consuming too much, as per EU recommendation we have this upper limits currently:

&gt;Dietary recommendations for EPA and DHA based on cardiovascular risk considerations for European adults are between 250 and 500 mg/day. Supplemental intakes of DHA alone up to about 1 g/day do not raise safety concerns for the general population. No data are available for DPA when consumed alone. In the majority of the human studies considered, fish oils, also containing DPA in generally unknown (but relatively low) amounts, were the source of EPA and DHA.

nutrition,"Your physical therapist can’t be expected to know much about nutrition, they aren’t nutritionists or dietitians. They only know how to exercise your muscles so that you can regain your strength and abilities and get close to your pre-injury self, movement-wise.

Protein is the best thing for muscle development and growth, so maybe adding a workout shake or bar to your day could enhance your PT progress. I’d hazard that in this time of healing, a small deficit or maintenance would be best, this way your body has the tools and energy it needs to heal and recover."
nutrition,"Yeah good advice. I'm already tracking what I eat, but should probably eat around maintenance. Thanks!"
nutrition,"Thank you. I just came across this elsewhere and I'm looking into it. It's frustrating, though, because here again the advice is mostly geared towards people who need to lose substantial amounts of weight, and/or are sedentary, and I'm already at a pretty healthy weight and exercise enough. Also my triglycerides are in the lower end of the normal range. Hopefully I'll get my doctor to order tests and figure out what's going on."
nutrition,"Thank you for your answer!

 

It was my impression that PUFAs + MUFAs should be the majority of the fat intake, making up around 20% of that 30% daily caloric intake? 

I agree that many of the links people provide here are of very low quality, many are not even actual papers but blogs.

&amp;#x200B;

The claim I have seen around here that bothers me the most is that PUFAs are only good because they counter-act the effect of MUFAs. I really do not understand where this is supposed to come from, considering the importance of unsaturated fats in the structure of our cell membranes."

nutrition,"Maybe there is a coincidence that they do not explain further? Or give a link to a strange blog post with mice studies.

nutrition,I switched to Natural Recovery Greens from Athletic Greens and love it.
nutrition,I wouldn't eat a surplus as you're not burning as many calories as you were pre injury. Stay in maintenance and just try to make wise choices around protein-complex carbs-etc. Get in your water and whatever exercise you're told to do to heal. But at the end of the day you need to recover fully so you can get back in the game. Be kind to yourself-calorie deficits and cutting will be there when you're 100% again:)

nutrition,"I have no idea about brown rice, sorry. My point was about the reasoning: 

1. How can you know you had no issues with it? I doubt Arsenic absorbed from rice has an immediate effect.
2. If you felt no effect, it doesn't mean it's not doing any harm to you. You could smoke cigarettes, feel no effect on your body, yet I can guarantee you that it's not good for you."

nutrition,"One more comment: the idea of a “complete” protein is based on the comparison of any food item compared to the protein in an egg, which I believe is closest to ours. The stew of amino acids inside us is constantly being depleted and replenished as needed; and it’s impossible to know what’s needed at any time &amp; irrelevant as well.

It’s been an exploded myth for at least 35 years that the combinations need to be eaten in the same meal; Frances Moore Lappé (Diet for a Small Planet) corrected her own error but no one paid attention. Vegans should be eating a wide variety of whole plants. Anyone eating meat or dairy certainly doesn’t have to worry about protein deficiency, which is called kwashiorkor, I believe. Hardly anyone knows it because it’s so rare in America. Eat lots of colors &amp; Whole Foods: you’ll be fine (vegans need a b-12 pill once a week)."

I'm used to hearing from gym bros talking about doubling protein from a starting point closer to your 100g (which I'm a little more skeptical about, but whatever works) but if you start at only like 50g daily I'm not surprised that you'd feel better at 80-100g!"
nutrition,You realise xylitol is a sugar alcohol not a free sugar right? Cant tell if I’ve misunderstood your comment or not.
nutrition,"This is how I understand it too. The actual portion size is larger than 100g, however it gives nutritional info for both. This also allows for easy math if the whole portion was to be divided into multiple servings"
nutrition,You any further reading on other sweeteners having negative affects?

For the times in my life that I have been gluten free I have felt better, lost weight and overall just felt more healthy. This probably has NOTHING to do with being gluten free and absolutely EVERYTHING to being in a calorie deficit and not eating a bunch of crap.

Keep in mind that processing food can change its nutritional properties - e.g. juiced fruits/vegetables won't give you the healthy fiber."
nutrition,I appreciate your reply thank you
nutrition,"Eating whole foods is typically better than powdered stuff.

'Superfood' is also a fairly meaningless designation.

For nutrients per dollar, leafy greens and colorful vegetables are your friend. Buy in-season produce as it'll be cheaper, tastier and probably healthier. I can send you a chart of what's in season when if you need one, or just Google it - it depends on your location.

If you absolutely need a powdered solution, hopefully someone else here can help you."

It reads and here I quote “How then can a liquid fat be turned into a soft solid without hydrogenation? The answer lies in a process known as “interesterification.” ... “The end result is equivalent to a “partially hydrogenated” fat without having to go through the process of hydrogenation. Thus we have a spreadable product without any trans fats.”

The interesterification process can turn liquid oil into solid oil and without the trans fat. 

I don’t know  where you live, but in Canada and US, trans fat is banned and is required to be labeled in the products.

nutrition,"Why does that matter? 

A firehose puts out more water per second, so that's less time you would have to turn the firehose on to gain more benefit. Does that mean a firehose is a ""better"" source of water for my kitchen than a regular sink?

Also, your claim isn't even true. Yes, animal meat has a lot of protein, but there are non-animal foods that contain just as much, if not more, protein per gram."

However, another finding of the same study is not widely reported. The study found that in the same quantities used in the study, hydrogenated vegetable oil TFAs were also NOT associated with CVD! This seems to be an example of how a widely deciminated half truth can fool the unwary.

I stopped eating butter and margarine many years ago because of the cholesterol and saturated fat alone but hearing about the trans fats for the first time was a bonus!"

Like, you can get more water per second from a firehose than from a regular tap, but I'm still not going to install a firehose in my kitchen. It doesn't mean it's a ""better source of water"" for my needs."

nutrition,"There doesn't seem to be evidence that natural trans fats are problematic. They show up not only in dairy but in the meat of all ruminants, this is because the trans fats come from the bacteria in the digestive system."
nutrition,Fantastic response.
nutrition,The body recycles amino acids (called endogenous proteins) everyday in the intestinal tract (up to 300 grams) so the incompleteness theory is moot.
nutrition,Good addition thank you :)
nutrition,"Issues with incomplete proteins typically arise when a nation is dependent on very few staple foods. For an average person in a wealthy country with an ample supply of a variety of foods this is not really a worry, unless you are a *very* picky eater.

nutrition,"Does margarine still have trans fat? I thought most of them are trans fat free. I don’t eat butter or margarine, but last time I checked my local store, the margarine they sold either Becel or some generic brand was trans fat free. 

There are artificial and natural trans fat. It is the artificial trans fat that is causing a great amount of health concerns and got itself banned in countries like US and Canada.

 * Chilli made with soy protein, served with refried beans (or beans in the chill if that's your thing), a mix of white and wild rice, and salad.

Loads of room for herbs and spices in both, and so also variation. Both of those can easily be made in 3 radically different ways, giving 6 different meals, and then you can add a salsa, guacamole depending on time, ingredients, etc.

Lastly, both lend themselves well to meal prep and as having for leftovers the next day."
nutrition,"You obviously have not heard of gluconeogenesis. Carbs may not be essential, but glycogen is. Just because you can make glycogen from other sources doesn’t mean it’s optimal. You will feel like shit, and yes, prolonged, extreme, keto is indeed dangerous."

You really would have to look at each individual nutrient ans answer this question separately for each one. To put it vaguely, most recommendations are pretty consistent overall, and when you see significant differences it will come down to the type of target being set and when it was last reviewed (RDA/EAR/AI and European equivalents; all have different definitions as to how they apply to populations vs. individuals and the standard of evidence required)."

That's a big difference than saying.

nutrition,Fruits are also sprayed with pesticides such as Atrazine and other chemicals which suppress testosterone (unnatural levels of reducedd testosterone is unhealthy in both men and women). They often also include xenoestrogens. Less testosterone and more estrogen increases water retention in the body especially the face.
nutrition,People don't know but most fruits are GMO and specifically bred to have more sugar to be tastier for market purposes. Apples 70 years ago tasted different than they do now. The sugar in them will increase water retention but it wont be as much compared to eating rice or pasta.
nutrition,"I’ve got many, but I’ll share my most recent one I did.. minestrone soup! I make it from memory, and for practicality I tend to design recipes by the typical package or ingredient sizes.

Olive oil 

Yellow onion (medium dice)

Garlic 3-7 cloves, minced.

Can of diced tomatoes (I like ‘petite’ diced but regular are ok)

Tomato paste

Box of broth 

Can of kidney beans

2-3 carrots (cut into cubes)

1-2 zucchinis (cut into cubes)

Celery heart (or 3-4 celery stalks, sliced)

Bay leaf

Salt and pepper 

Pasta of your choice. Optional, but I like it for texture and it’s a common ingredient in other minestrone recipes. I recommend smaller ones, like shells, rotini, macaroni or alphabet.

- also recommended: bouillon paste. Depending on your broth, (they really can vary in flavor!) so if your soup broth feels a bit bland, take some of the liquid from the pot and put it in a bowl. Whisk in a bit of the bouillon and tomato paste, and add a small amount at a time to your soup. (this is easier to gauge the flavor you add, vs dropping a little chunk of very concentrated, super salty bouillon directly into the pot)

————————————————————————

In a Dutch oven, heat the olive oil. Sauté the onion until it’s translucent (~5 min) add salt to taste.

Add bay leaf and carrots, until the carrots begin to soften. Add celery and garlic; cook until it softens a bit. Roughly 5 min. Add pepper (up to you how much you like)

Drop 2-3 tablespoons of tomato paste into the pot and stir, let this cook for a few minutes. &gt;Cooking the tomato paste here in the oil adds a lot of flavor vs dropping it in later.&lt;

Add the broth, diced tomatoes, zucchini and pasta. Simmer until the pasta is soft. 

&gt;taste the broth at this point. Here is where you’d add the bouillon/ tomato paste mix if you feel you need that&lt;

Add the kidney beans. 

I like to serve this with bread!"
nutrition,"Avocado tacos, topped with onion cilantro  and salsa"
nutrition,"Yeah that's generally what I saw, I wish I could find it! Every time I google searched, daily macro percentages came up instead. But if I come across it, I'll reply here."
nutrition,"fried tofu with veggies
(can be some frozen mix or whatever i find in the fridge) bit of soya sauce bit of sweet and sour sauce, you can also add bulgur or cuscus, it's easy, quite quick and filling"
nutrition,Good luck! You can do it.
nutrition,"Omelettes with whatever filling, maybe a side salad"
nutrition,"Plant Based dieters look aged, just have a balanced diet! Too much meat &amp; too many Carbs will also have a negative effect. Whatever you eat just try to be sustainable. Drink plenty of water rather than coffee or cola etc."
nutrition,"To strictly answer your question:  No, carbohydrates do not matter. It is simply cals in vs cals out.

You can lose weight eating just 2 slices of bread a day.

BUT: if we're talking about overall health, then maybe limiting some carbohydrates is a good idea- high glycemic refined carbohydrates that constantly spike your insulin is a bad idea.

Insulin is also a storing hormone, so limiting carbohydrates would make you lose weight faster (just remember, the initial weight loss would be glycogen and water).

I personally eat carbs, but I only have 20-60g of it a day. The rest is protein and fat (more satiating macros, will help you stay fuller for longer).

If you're an endurance athlete, chances are you're going to need some carbohydrates- just try opt for low GI ones when you can (mu favourite are tortilla wraps)."
nutrition,"Carbs matter for body composition (fat to muscle ratio), not losing weight.

Burning more calories than you consume makes you lose weight. Weight is bone, water, fat, lean tissue. Carbs are good for quick energy; if you aren't exercising and are just losing weight by being sedentary but in a caloric deficit, the carbs will get broken down into sugar, which gets converted to fat quickest.

Basically if you want to lose weight and minimize jiggliness, eat carbs to fuel workouts. If you're gonna lose weight without exercise, I'd avoid all simple carbs. Complex carbs are fine, but stick to high protein to increase satiety."
nutrition,"It has good micros, and it's pretty nice for vegans to use to get that fish taste. I've only ever used nori though and for the fish flavor"
nutrition,Including weight loss? I find that hard to believe.
nutrition,"I've been overweight since I was 10. Not obese but just overweight for my age. Never able to portion control or sustain a 'diet'. Till recently, I went Keto and now Carnivore. Never felt better and weight just drops.   


I feel cutting carbs is almost like cheating, once you detox from carbs+sugar your body just doesnt desire it. You feel better , head clear, no bloating , no pain (my tendonitis is gone within a week). I wish more people would like this for a few months if they struggle with losing weight.   


For me, anytime I eat carbs, I want more carbs. Because carbs = sugar in the body. Now on carnivore, my BODY doesn't crave and neither does my mind.   


Anyway, I can tell ya from personal experience, carbs definitely matter for weightloss. (especially if you feel like your carb and sugar cravings dont stop no matter what you do).  


Please don't attack me, I am just sharing my personal experience."
nutrition,"Another point usually overlooked is the substitution effect. If you avoid healthy brown rice what will you eat instead? Brown rice has a good start over most foods because it contains fibre and is low in fat, sugar and salt. Whatever you eat instead has a very good chance of failing that test and being less healthy overall."
nutrition,"The number of calories you eat is more important, but eating slower digesting carbs with lots of fiber is helpful to feeling fuller longer. Otherwise, eating lots of protein, moving when possible, and eating nutrient-dense food can help with weight loss if you don’t feel like being super meticulous about counting calories.

Edit: grammar"
nutrition,It depends. If you are physically active then eating carbs is the norm but if you are always sitting or lying down then low carbs diet is a better choice. Just make sure to drink plenty of water when you are in a low carb diet. Eating high amount of protein and fat can damage your kidneys.
nutrition,Sleep trumps nutrition and exercise in any health aspect.
nutrition,"For weight loss i gain my carbs from potatoes and vegetables, rather than processed flour, rice and pasta. Carbs are essential for energy, but i always make sure i eat a plate with high protein content as well for weight loss. Example of my dinner is, chicken, mushrooms, and sweet potatoes!"
nutrition,"What would you say is ""sparing""? I currently use about a 1"" x 4"" piece in my soaking/cooking water for 3 servings of rice, discarding as water starts to simmer. Now I'm scared if that's unhealthy lol.."
nutrition,"I use cronometer to track my micronutrients and it’s a helpful baseline for where I come up short on average.  I get most of what I need from whole foods, which is my preference, but it’s clear I also have some needs I can’t meet or can’t meet enough with food and in those cases I’m glad vitamins exist to fill the gaps.
For example, my neurologist recommended a really high amount of B2 to help my migraines and as a vegan I don’t eat things with B12 or very much D. My multivitamin that covers all three is therefore very helpful. However, I don’t take a fiber supplement anymore because I now get a lot more fiber from adjusting what I eat.
If you don’t know what you’re eating, you might waste money by picking vitamins which you may already be getting enough of, or you might overlook a deficiency that isn’t talked about often. Vitamins can be very helpful, but your diet should be part of how you decide what you need help with."
nutrition,I agree lettuce gets broken down and nutrients are absorbed. But high fiber fruits and vegetables get processed so quickly and efficiently that there is evidence we don’t consume all the calories from these foods.
nutrition,"As I understand it, eating carbs late in the day, when the body (usually) requires less energy and metabolism has slowed, will have a negative impact on weight.  I'm no expert but I try to not have carbs after 1800, worked for me."
nutrition,Brown rice grown in California has less arsenic and rinsing the rice will help reduce levels. Overall it’s such a healthy grain that it’s better to just accept this and still consume it in my opinion but also depends what you would substitute if you stopped eating it.
nutrition,"Yeah I stopped eating bread last week and I feel so young, crazy"
nutrition,"Anecdotally speaking, whenever I limit my carb intake to complex carbs revolving around exercise and fats to healthy fats - and eat in a 8 hour window that is finished long time before going to sleep - I feel kind of fine. Just naturally healthy, no brainfog, no crashing after eating, waking up early without alarm etc.

You are generally in mild ketosis eve after waking up, and for me with this active lifestyle I can go up to 100grams and still be 16hours into keto easily.

But I personally do still need carbs, can not work out this hard or do cold bath sessions without some proper energy source.

Still as others have mentioned, ""low carb"" does not mean fibrous healthy, and those things are more important imho."
nutrition,Youre missing 2. Fire up the printer(s)
nutrition,"There's no pill that will make you lose weight, but vitamins can help you with nutrition. For instance, a lack of vitD can make you depressed and weaken your immune system, which in turn can make you overeat (because you're depressed and always have a cold or something so you don't feel like exercising, for instance). Imo what's helpful is a full bloodwork to see if you are deficient in any vitamin or mineral, and then you take it from there (and don't forget to adjust your diet before chugging pills: you can have your vitA with a greens smoothie, and two Brazil nuts cover your selenium needs for the day)."

"" **Lemon juice** in its natural state is acidic with a pH of about 2, but once metabolized it actually becomes **alkaline** with a pH well above 7. So, outside the **body**, anyone **can** see that **lemon juice** is very acidic. However, once fully digested, its effect is proven to be alkalizing with many health benefits. """

nutrition,"Good on the water, make sure you maintain electrolyte balance if you drink a lot (I drink way too much lol). Idk about cheese, I pretty much cut that from my meals.  Skim milk, yogurt, and mozzarella (in recipes) are pretty much the only dairy products I include in my diet besides protien shakes &gt;&gt; generally speaking I'd taper off on the thicker/less healthy sauces and snacks, as they can make a healthy meal unhealthy and add to the calorie count in insidiously high amounts.

nutrition,"Depends on age and amount of exercise, I'd say 2500 cals a day max since you'll need to lose about 1-2ibs a week to reach your goal (maybe ease into it so your don't stress). Types of calories matters too, for example protein is good cause it helps build muscle and makes you feel full. Personal advice for weight loss  would be to zero in on what you're drinking - its shocking how many calories are in most drinks, so keep an eye on that. Exercise in addition to a healthy diet is definitely better for your body than dieting by itself so keep up the cardio - I'd add just a bit of intensity/weight training to your routine (even just some dumbells at home) and that can really help."

This isn't so much an indication that the body can't digest lettuce, but rather more likely the result of their body trying to deal with a sudden influx of higher-than-normal amounts of fiber. If lettuce is consumed regularly, the amount of lettuce found in the toilet will decrease, as their body adjusts to the quantity of fiber, as well as fiber source"
nutrition,"Yes, if used correctly and taken with the right diet supplements can help (emphasis on the word Help) you maintain adequate nutrition while cutting calories. It's important to remember though that you may pass a large portion of the vitamins as you take them so its a good idea to take them with food.

High fiber content and essentially no calorie and bunch of fat and water soluble minerals and vitamins. You really can’t over eat veggies calorie-wise unless you a truck load. You can also over eat on fat soluble vitamins like vitA which can mess you up and it will show up in your blood tests. Vary and balance your veggie intake. Water soluble vitamins should be fine cuz they’ll pass through.

I went on a tangent, haha sorry, but I just wanted to say yah eat veggies basically no consequence calorie wise and great strategy to use for cuts."
nutrition,I won't dispute that. It's just that sometimes it seems like people forget that food that's good for you and contains carbohydrates exists.
nutrition,This is because of the hunger hormone ghrellin. Carbs cause a spike in ghrellin every 4-6 hours after eating. Fats and protein do not have this effect.
nutrition,"If you don’t eat carbs your water and glycogen stores may decrease (that’s why you may lose a lot of weight really fast).

Keep in mind weight on the scale is one number. Losing fat and gaining muscle may keep you at the same weight, but also you may see your clothes start to feel loose. 

I would say focus on balanced meals that yes include carbs but also fats and protein (don’t forget your micronutrients!) exercise, drink water, and sleep.

Don’t stress out about it. Focus on the long term ."
nutrition,"It really is that fast. Once you run out of glycogen stores (about 24 hours) and your body starts using alternative methods to make fuel that is considered ""starvation"". How long you can last in starvation depends on body composition and activity, so from weeks to months. 

Exercising stimulates muscle protein synthesis but also muscle protein breakdown. When you're not eating food, eventually muscle protein breakdown is going to exceed muscle protein synthesis. But your body prioritizes maintaining muscle mass, so in the beginning the breakdown of protein will happen elsewhere (like the cells of the intestinal lining or skin cells) and protein catabolism decreases. What i'm talking about is during prolonged fasting/during starvation where there is zero food intake. There's a whole other conversation to be had about intermittent fasting/hormones/building muscle when you're bouncing between the fed and fasted state. 

Also, your muscles are not ""protein stores"" per se, like how glycogen is glucose storage. The amount of muscle you have is the amount needed to support your usual activities, so no matter what state you're in you're going to lose muscle mass if you don't use your muscles because muscle exists to actively function. The longer you are in starvation, the more your body loses the ability to maintain muscle mass no matter how much you exercise but this isn't really a concern during intermittent fasting."

I'm sorry you're having an issue finding products with good, accurate nutrition info!"
nutrition,"&gt;Take the skinny-ass competitive eaters.  They're consuming an insane amount of calories.  If it were CICO, they'd all be morbidly obese.

They're not consuming an insane amount of calories every single day, some train stretching their stomach with water, do daily cardio to stay slim, etc.  Anecdotally this means nothing.

&gt; Or take the ultramarathoners - are their bodies really using vast amounts of calories on their 30th mile? 

[You'll burn roughly 400 to 600 calories per hour during your run, but your body can absorb only 240 to 280 calories per hour](https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a20808916/how-to-fuel-up-during-an-ultra-marathon/).  Nutrition is a huge part of running ultra's... only allow someone to drink water and have salt tabs and see how well they're doing after 30 miles.

&gt; the idea that we can accurately count the amount of calories our bodies are using for energy 

Exactly?  No, but we can count accurately enough for the purposes of weight loss/gain."
nutrition,"Having lost 100 pounds by carefully tracking, you're just wrong. Also every test ever done disagrees. Competitive eaters don't eat like that every day, and I did have to eat 4k calories every day when doing 15 miles a day. 15 miles at my weight is right about 2k calories, twice my base calories, and the scale stayed the same while eating double the calories. A marathon would use about 4k. So how does even more for an ultramarathon not make sense?"
nutrition,Amazing
nutrition,All you need is a calorie deficit to lose weight. The only thing cutting carbs does is make you lose weight faster. But you can get the same result with a calorie deficit the slower
nutrition,"Simply put, blood sugar level decides whether you will store fat or use fat for energy. Carb impacts blood sugar the most, protein next, then fat. When you eat a high carb meal with little fiber or fat to slow the absorption of the carb, your blood sugar will be high, all of which is stored due to a hormone called insulin. If you wait for blood sugar to return to normal (means no eating between meals), the opposite hormone glucagon can activate which makes sure your blood sugar doesn’t get too low. How’s it do that? By using up stored fat.

Best way to go about fat loss or maintenance is by spacing out meals, eat proper balanced meals which contain protein and fats too so you can stay full longer, eat only complex carbs (absorption into bloodstream is delayed by fiber rather than skyrocketing blood sugar followed by a crash), and don’t snack between meals. Complex carbs is things like whole wheat, potatoes/starchy vegetables, vegetables, etc. And if you are to have simple carbs, stick to fruit since it has fiber unlike thinks like ice cream, cake, added sugar, etc."
nutrition,Crap sleep = more hunger hormone which = more chance of over eating.
nutrition,"Priority is calories than food composition.

Some tips:

Veggies and water are empty calories that fill you up. 


For a cut:
Before a meal try to active your stomachs “full sensors” asap

Before a meal drink tons of water and veggies then wait 5 minutes then start your meal. Keep protein content high and eat as slow as possible, chew longer than usual. I promise you, your body will feel super full and you will eat less. Also eat in a smaller plate, kinda tricks the mind that you have a full plate and a full meal.

Take your time with the cut, keep gradual goals. Maybe have it so that you lose 15lbs then give your body a break and do a maintenance calorie thing for a week or so then go back to cutting.

While keeping protein intake high definitely invest that protein into workouts.

Also space out your meals throughout the day, keep glucose levels as normal as possible throughout the day. 

A cut is mentally exhausting, you’re gonna feel low energy and other things, try to keep the energy flow constant and steady. It helps if you have many meals that are small throughout the day. 

I recommend this book: Renaissance diet 2.0 by Dr. mike Israetel.

I’m almost done reading his book. It’s an excellent book. He truly puts the science back into “diets” and what is actually important and what to think about food. He keeps things simple and focuses on practical ideas."
nutrition,Its easier to eat low cal when cutting carbs
nutrition,"It's just calories in calories out, but imo carbs help me stay lean because they give me the energy to workout every single day."
nutrition,That's a bingo. And it leads to netflix binges instead of workouts.
nutrition,"It doesn't effect calories out much, and not sleeping might burn a few calories, but in practice missed sleep causes most people to get less exercise and eat more. Lack of sleep tends to make everything worse. You'll fail at gaining muscle, lose more if you're anorexic, and gain fat if you're overweight."
nutrition,It negatives impacts leptin and ghrelin.  Not only are you hungrier but it takes longer to feel full. Also your body will be more likely to burn muscle instead of fat
nutrition,"Yep, increases the ghrelin hormone the next day which is pure cravings"
nutrition,"&gt; They do matter: processed carbs especially because they don't have fibre. 

That formulation makes me curious about your view on non-processed  food that contains a significant amount of carbohydrates."
nutrition,Even if sugar is a listed ingredient? Second mind you so it was probably added right?
nutrition,How has that diet been?
nutrition,"Don't forget about potassium.   


High amounts of Salt is definitely bad for you if you lack potassium in your diet as it can increase salt sensitivity (leading to higher BP)."
nutrition,Is potassium deficiency a common problem? I've heard this is true for magnesium but potassium is in many popular foods in abundance.
nutrition,"Huge oversimplification indeed.  Very well put.  I've been saying the same thing for years, and just made a similar comment.  Watch us both get downvoted to hell now.

Complex issues like weight gain and body type cannot be answered with smug, simplistic slogans.  Body composition, hormones, insulin resistance, genetics etc. etc. all play a role in determining if/where we lose or gain body fat."
nutrition,I was generalizing and simplifying.
nutrition,So it doesn't change how you process the calories but it makes it harder to eat right.
nutrition,"Ok, I'll be ""that guy"", as usual. They said ""carbs"", not ""sugary food"". That said, eating nutritious food with a good amount of protein is a good idea generally as well as if you want to lose weight!"
nutrition,"True, I only eat breakfast when I slept like crap, and then I probably overdo it."
nutrition,i think its because of the nutrients within the chicken breast and donuts. im not sure im only in 9th but i think carbs will not fill u up as much as chicken breast since of the protien diffrence
nutrition,"Keep in mind not all carbs are equal. Potatoes and oatmeal for example have really high satiety indexes. It’s all about balancing carbs, protein, and fat for most people."
nutrition,"I understand the calorie in calorie out science, but (taking this to the ridiculous) if you eat solely 2000 calories of donuts vs. 2000 calories of just chicken breast, you’re going to look and feel different. 

I think.

Any takers?"
nutrition,"Calories matter but so do macro nutrients which are fats, carbs, protein. A perfect combination of the macro nutrients within a calorie deficit (eating fewer calories than you are burning) is going to be key to weight loss. 

This is all individual too. It is true that protein is MORE satiating than carbs but carbs are good for energy and if you are working out and are very active, don't skip them.  

Look for carbs that also contain fiber like vegetables and fruits as well as oatmeal, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and whole grains. 

But also don't completely shun things like cookies. You can still have a treat and lose weight. And it might be better to not completely exclude foods you love because it will be easier to continue with your diet if you get to eat things you love along the way."
nutrition,"Cals in cals out is so wrong on so many levels.  Are a higher number of calories correlated with greater weight gain?  Of course.  But the idea that we can accurately count the amount of calories our bodies are using for energy is utter bunk.

Our conception of calories, generally, is off.  This article does a good job of explaining. [https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160201-why-the-calorie-is-broken](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160201-why-the-calorie-is-broken)

But I came to this conclusion after years of pondering the issue and staying fit.  Just use common sense, and think of a few examples.

Take the skinny-ass competitive eaters.  They're consuming an insane amount of calories.  If it were CICO, they'd all be morbidly obese.

Or take the ultramarathoners - are their bodies really using vast amounts of calories on their 30th mile?  Or is something else at play physiologically?

Don't get me wrong, the less you eat, the leaner you'll be is an extremely good rule of thumb.  And daily fasting has kept me very lean.  

But our bodies are enormously complex, and the idea that (what I call) ""lab calories"" enter and accumulate in our bodies equally just seems so contrary to common sense and experience.  We're not robots, and there are so many x factors at play, including our body composition, insulin sensitivity, types of calories eaten, etc."
nutrition,I think sleep is one of the most important things when I sleep for 7 hours I feel like shit and my head muscles and skin feel weird.
nutrition,"Agreed, when I'm under-slept it is a lot harder to say no to junk food"
nutrition,"Some studies show that sleep deprived subjects on a calorie deficit diet lose more muscle than non sleep deprived subjects, even if the weight loss is comparable"
nutrition,"It's all relative, just how much do you care about your health?

Are they protein shakes or more like huel?"
nutrition,"I think that sometimes, reality has to be considered more than what we would do or eat ideally. Props to you for getting your protein in.

I’d just make sure that you’re not consuming too much added sugar in the protein shakes you’re having. On the days you have more time/ aren’t working a 15 hour shift, you could just choose more natural protein sources. You’ll be fine having the shakes during your shifts. 

I’m sure you already thought of this- but you could also add in some hard boiled eggs, adult lunchable with natural deli meat, Greek yogurt, some crackers and veggies, or some Greek yogurt with fruit. Those are pretty easy to prep, grab, and eat, too. Good luck!"
nutrition,this post had like 12 upvotes what species of weird humans are downvoting this i spent so much time on this LMAO
nutrition,"Not sure on the science, but from personal experience i have seen a direct link between lack of sleep and binging on sugar/carbs/crap which then leads me to exceeding my calories."
nutrition,"Reparing muscless, growth hormone secreation as well as other importnat hormones, some of which are responsibile for felling of hunger."
nutrition,"Calories in, calories out, from a purely scientific standpoint.

But if you start eating too many simple carbs, you'll be ""carb addicted"" and weight loss will be more difficult, psychologically speaking."
nutrition,"CICO so it doesn't really matter but the more protein you eat, the more full you'll feel! also helps you build muscles &amp; then the more calories you can burn!"
nutrition,"It depends on what the calories are for overall health. The composition of the calories will affect how they’re processed and converted in your body. The reason keto works isn’t because it’s low calorie, but because it’s high fat/protein and low carb since most simple carbs get converted into sugar, which turns into fat. Complex carbs are great, and get converted more into energy, as do protein, fats, and veggies. While hitting a calorie deficit is key to losing weight, the types of calories will affect your overall health and energy levels, which are key for maintaining a rigorous exercise routine (which should complement your diet). 

Having said that, I would never suggest entirely eliminating an entire food group. Keto - for example - works for many, but it’s too restrictive on carbs that I need for my workouts, and I worry about eating saturated fats too often. 

Long story short: they type and amount of carbs you consume will ultimately matter, even though overall calorie deficit is the main rule IF you’re only concerned with weight and not overall health/fitness."
nutrition,"Beans, grains, veggies, fruits, nuts, seeds"
nutrition,"They do matter: processed carbs especially because they don't have fibre. Processed carbs are absorbed really quickly, are very calorie dense, spike your blood sugar a lot, and leave you hungry soon after. Hunger obviously plays a huge role in weight loss (and gain), so eating things that make you more full are better for progress than eating things that make you hungry again very quickly.

The combination of carbs and saturated fats, found in a lot of processed foods, are also problematic for losing weight. The fewer processed foods you can have, especially with these super tasty but bad for you combinations, the better you'll be able to succeed with weight loss.

Carbs are super addictive - I would know because I would have these simple/processed carbs every day! But I feel way better without them and this has benefitted my progress a ton.

Happy to share some studies with you, it will just require some digging!

&amp;#x200B;

Calories of course matter, but it's a huge oversimplification.

It's like saying to just lift weights to build muscle without saying anything else. ""Just lift the weights up = more muscle! So easy, duh"" is the same as saying it's just calories in, calories out for weight loss. Without telling people how heavy the weights should be, how many reps, how many sets, what their form should be, to make sure they eat enough protein, to stay hydrated, to have rest days, etc etc, we'd be setting people up for failure and dangerous injuries. There's a reason that we have more guidance for building muscle than just to lift weights, period. If that's all we told people, they'd have to figure out all the rest on their own and fail a lot along the way because it's not intuitive."
nutrition,"It technically doesn’t matter, but your ability to adhere to a diet is greatly effected by the carbs u eat"

nutrition,"Your body isn’t able to store all types of nutrients it needs. That’s why we have to eat and can’t just live off our fat. So you can eat carbs but you also need to eat all the other essential amino acids and protein to upkeep your body. But if you eat a lot of carbs and not enough of the good stuff then you might loose weight but it might just be muscle weight and it will be a slow process and you won’t feel good or be able to think straight. 

And carbs don’t fill you up as much so you will feel like you are eating less if you are eating a lot of carbs while dieting, which will likely make you eat more and then slow your weight loss progress."
nutrition,"Questions like this one come up in this subreddit somewhat frequently, and while I'm happy to help with others to clear the confusion, it's disheartening to see the legacy of 80s/90s diet propaganda living so strongly to this day.

The idea that a diet void of any flavour is somehow more healthy in a way you can't explain is very worrisome, and quite frankly totally ludicrous, and it's not a knock on you. There are almost certainly thousands of others who think the same thing and it keeps the idea alive.

Salt, spices and sugars found in fruits and vegetables should be cornerstones of any diet. In moderation, even small quantities of processed sugars should have a place. You shouldn't feel like you have to cut out entire food groups to be 'healthy' at the expense of social and cultural connection and your mental health."
nutrition,About 50% of the other comments here indicate otherwise
nutrition,Agreed.
nutrition,"“We are eating mostly plants”— who is? Americans? Americans are eating mostly processed food. I have a number of other criticisms of your arguments here: e.g. cholesterol is in no way “essential” from dietary sources, we can make plenty of our own, and saturated fat consumption is well correlated with heart disease, however you are correct in that the animal *protein* it comes with may well turn out be the real culprit. I don’t want to argue with you any further. You seem like a smart guy, and your life is yours to shorten as you please. I recommend you read T. Colin Campbell’s book “The China Study” if you want to balance your perspective some."
nutrition,"There's no evidence that artificial sweeteners raise insulin or have harmful effects. The only real negative from zero sugar soft drinks is that it's bad for your teeth, but assuming you brush your teeth regularly it's not a big deal."
nutrition,100% right! 👍
nutrition,"I’d say no, but keeping protein high will eat up some of your calorie range for eating too many carbs. 

Losing weight and retaining muscle you need to do the following:

Calorie deficit 
Keep protein intake high 
Resistance train 
Sleep well 

There are others but a pretty basic list here."
nutrition,"The more nutritious the carbs and food you are eating, the better you will feel long term. But to answer your question with regards to losing weight, the source of the carbs does not matter. Like you said, cals in and cals out."
nutrition,I couldn't agree more!
nutrition,"Yes, different nutrients come from different colors. It’s fine if they’re changed weekly."
nutrition,"Humans are nowhere near herbivores. The only argument I need to dispute that claim is that our cecum does not function and is much much smaller than other primates, whereas it is functional in all herbivores. Also our stomach pH is around 1.5 - 2.5, not exactly what herbivores have is it?

Saturated fat and cholesterol are essential for human health and are not proven to be related to heart disease thanks to new research. You do not get either of these from plants. Many nutrients in plants are either not convertable or are absorbed at a fraction of what you can get in animal foods. Animal foods are much more nutritious than plants.

I could further disprove us being herbivores by going into our evolution, but I think the info I provided, plus the fact that we are eating mostly plants nowadays anyways while also being as sick as ever is enough."
nutrition,Also what kind of salt matters. If you’re gonna eat the shitty refined salt yea no bueno but when you get unrefined real sea salt or pink Himalayan that shit is actually good for you lol

nutrition," 

Hello. I'm 32, male, weight 250lbs, 5'11, I've been fit all my life but I gain fat easily. I lose the fat hard and keeping it off feels impossible. Over the last few years I've hired nutritionists and learned how to eat to lose weight and keep it off.

At one point I gained 25 pounds and lost 20. I gained it all back and since COVID i've gained another 15. I'm at a point right now where i've lost my motivation for being lean. I have a gut now and i went from a size 38 to size 42.

When I do count calories I always feel exhausted and depressed. I hate the feeling of being tired all the time and I feel miserable. Am I supposed to feel that way on a 500 calorie deficit? Also, at this point i've lost all motivation and even thinking about counting calories feels miserable.

I don't know what to do to get motivated. I'm afraid I'll accept being fat and wind up obese.

Have any of you experienced this? I really need help because I don't know what to do.

Please be gentle in your response, this is a vulnerable question for me and I appreciate your sensitivity. Thanks!"
nutrition,"Humans have long, coiled intestines, like herbivores. Cats’ intestines are very short, to reduce exposure the toxic breakdown and putrefaction products from meat. Humans are something between scavengers and herbivores, (whatever the media tells you) and forcing your body to regularly endure exposure to these dangerous chemicals (TMAO, ammonia, etc.) is not a very good long-term strategy. I’m not going to bother arguing with you beyond this, but these are the conclusions I drew on the issue after a LOT of research, trying to undermine the perspective I held as much as I could. If you’re right then you’re right and you’ll be fine but I know you aren’t, and what you’re doing to your body is dangerous, so my recommendation is that you play devil’s advocate on your position for a while, just to see how the evidence stacks up.

Work with a healthcare provider who can monitor your labs. If it’s not working, try a different approach. I’d also like to suggest that the quality of the tea may be more important than when you drink it. I would select a 100% organic brand.

Yes, strictly speaking it's calories metabolized vs calories spent, and your calories metabolized aren't *exactly* the same as the ones you consume... the difference is also utterly fucking irrelevant and inconsequential in 99.9999999% of situations, and now you turned an extremely easy to understand concept into a much harder, more intimidating, and harder to process clusterfuck for exactly 0 practical benefit.

The numbers you calculate for your base metabolic rate aren't 100% accurate either. Neither are the labels on stuff... It's all close enough though. Outside of EXTREMELY specific situations, arguing that it's calories metabolized, not consumed, here is like arguing about whether a line a few millimeters off... in a game of orbital darts throwing projectiles the size of trains at targets the size of countries.

Meanwhile you're making making the information wayyy harder to understand and assimilate, by several orders of magnitude, which very significantly lowers adherence, which is infinitely more important than the roughly 0 benefit you'll see from complicating the process many fold.

So to answer the op, ignore the post I'm replying to 100%: consume meaningfully fewer calories than you burn consistently and you'll lose weight.

The exact caloric deficit varies with your specific metrics, but most online calculators or apps will give you a decent goal - usually between 200 to 1000 calories less. 500 is usually a safe enough starting point and adjust from there. Food volume does not matter.

My stance on olive oil. The whole olive would be healthier than the processed olive oil. Olive oil is also quite resource intensive. It would be healthier to get your fats from whole plant foods which also contain fiber and water compared to straight oil no matter the source. Will a little harm your health? Probably not. Will daily use harm your health? I think it will contribute to worse health outcomes when compared with Whole Foods which the oils were derived.

Coconut oil for example is something I avoid completely whereas I’m eating coconut from a fresh coconut for breakfast. When we process a food it usually makes the product less healthy than the whole food that’s my stance.

And with a population that is mostly over weight and obese, eating processed oil is an unnecessary component in their diet and contributes 120 calories per tablespoon. 

When people see an oil is heart healthy they pour it on all of their other foods and think they’re doing themselves a favor when really it’s not so simple."

My point was more that while being an exercise freak, a goose stepping nutrition nazi, and getting plenty of sleep certainly helps...  it doesn't come close to recreating the level of energy I see in an 10 year old vs a 40 year old.  

Like maybe the amount of ""feeling energized"" in a 10 year old child is 100%, and a 40 year old might be down to 20%.  Now that 40 year old can eat right, sleep, etc. etc.  but it might only put them back up to 25% ""arbitrary energy level"".

As far as I can tell it hasn’t been shown beyond this single study, so may be worth future consideration in research. I’d be concerned about stevia if this was shown in a human sample, but at present this only really shows a potential mechanism. We can’t provide dietary recommendations based on this lone study.

\&gt;  In terms of their postprandial effect on endothelial function, the beneficial components of the Mediterranean and Lyon Diet Heart Study diets appear to be antioxidant-rich foods, including vegetables, fruits, and their derivatives such as vinegar, and omega-3-rich fish and **canola oils**. 

\&gt;  A Mediterranean-style diet might be effective in **reducing** the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and its associated cardiovascular risk.   


\&gt; Consumption of an SAFA-rich meal is harmful for the endothelium, while a **MUFA-rich meal does not impair endothelial function in subjects with type 2 diabetes.**

nutrition,"That source was the simplified version here are the actual sources compiled starting with olive oil. I’ll send you the video and below the video are the peer reviewed sources.

https://nutritionfacts.org/video/olive-oil-and-artery-function/

I don’t think it would be the best idea to jump right down to the sources and skip the video because he often cites sources and shows you where he might disagree with a point or exposes nuance. So just because the source is below he might be pointing out flaws with the study, so I encourage you to check out the video.

I informed my opinion on olive oil mostly with the help of videos like these and not the article I cited. 

He synthesizes peer reviewed literature. This video synthesized 16 peer reviewed studies. I’d put it closer to the top than expert opinion of course. I’d put it into the filtered information portion of the evidence pyramid.

Here’s another synthesis on EVOO

The relative paralysis of our arteries for hours after eating fast food and cheesecake may also occur after consuming olive oil. Olive oil was found to have the same impairment to endothelial function as high-fat foods like sausage and egg breakfast sandwiches. (See my Olive Oil and Artery Function video for an illustrative chart with different foods.)

Studies that have suggested endothelial benefits after olive oil consumption have measured something different: ischemia-induced dilation as opposed to flow-mediated dilation. There’s just not good evidence that’s actually an accurate index of endothelial function, which is what predicts heart disease. Hundreds of studies have shown that the ischemia-induced dilation test can give a false negative result.

Other oils have also been shown to have deleterious results on endothelial function. A significant and constant decrease in endothelial function appears within three hours after each meal, independent of the type of oil and whether the oil was fresh or deep fried. Olive oil may be better than omega-6-rich oils or saturated fats, but it still showed adverse effects. This was the case with regular, refined olive oil. But what about extra-virgin olive oil?

Extra-virgin olive oil retains a fraction of the anti-inflammatory phytonutrients found in the olive fruit, and so doesn’t appear to induce the spike in inflammatory markers caused by regular olive oil. What does that mean for our arteries? Extra-virgin olive oil may have more of a neutral effect compared to butter, which exerted a noxious effect that lasted for up to six hours—basically right up until our next meal. In the largest prospective study ever to assess the relationship between olive oil consumption and cardiac events like heart attacks, there was a suggestion that virgin olive oil may be better than regular olive oil, but neither was found to significantly reduce heart attack rates after controlling for healthy dietary behaviors like vegetable intake, which tends to go hand-in-hand with olive oil intake.

There have also been studies showing that even extra-virgin olive oil, contrary to expectations, may significantly impair endothelial function. Why then do some studies suggest endothelial function improves on a Mediterranean diet, which is rich in olive oil? It may be because the Mediterranean diet is also rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, and walnuts. Fruits and vegetables appear to provide some protection against the direct impairment of endothelial function produced by high-fat foods, including olive oil; therefore, improvements in health may be in spite of, rather than because of, the oil. In terms of their effects on post-meal endothelial function, the beneficial components of the Mediterranean diet may primarily be the antioxidant-rich foods, the vegetables, fruits, and their derivatives, such as balsamic vinegar. Adding some vegetables to a fatty meal may partially restore arterial functioning and blood flow.

I don’t suffer from depression and never really have suffered from depression. Lower cholesterol is not causal for higher instance of stroke. Though low B12 levels is associated with more stroke so I make sure to get my B12.

Let’s look at one study from your article.

&gt; Participants with ""desirable"" TC levels (&lt;200 mg/dL) performed less well than participants with borderline-high TC levels (200-239 mg/dL) and participants with high TC levels (there exists 240 mg/dL).

They just lumped every single person with a total cholesterol of 200 and below into the same group. My total cholesterol is 98 mg/dL. The other studies only looked at people with 150mg/dL of cholesterol. 

Anything under 150 mg/dL is considered healthy and anything above you’re at risk for more heart disease and cancer. So by lumping in people with 190mg/dL with those with 100mg/dL you get a masked effect. My cholesterol is much much lower than the average population and from others studies I’ve seen they often don’t study people with my level of Cholesterol in the US. 

We used to think low cholesterol was bad in the US prior to finding out that people in China actually normally had total cholesterol near 100mg/dL. And those people in China had better health outcomes not worse health outcomes.

&gt; In what seems to be a contradiction to our China findings, large studies done in the Netherlands found no correlation between cholesterol levels and cancer. How is this possible? The difficulty here appears to be that the Dutch have one of the highest intakes of animal fat in the world. On average, cholesterol levels in the West are 210-­220 milligrams versus the Chinese 125-­130. The implication is that reducing cholesterol from very high levels to high levels may not be enough to affect cancer incidence. Only as cholesterol levels drop further, into the strikingly low levels seen in China, do cancer rates decline. How to achieve such low cholesterol levels? Doing so is possible only on a low-fat, plant-based diet, since even surprisingly small intakes of animal-based foods are associated with significant increases in cholesterol levels.

nutrition,"You need to add a lot of veggies, both because it's healthy and because your stomach has stretch sensors that switch off the hunger when activated, and you won't get enough bulk in there to activate them without a big salad or similar (unless you overeat). As a tip, avoid boiling veggies, they come out tasteless. Try roasting them with some garlic and spices instead! Also I'd try IF, snacking and hunger were the two main problems for me and IF took care of both. You also have to cook less, so you automatically think less about food. Good luck!"

nutrition,"&gt;it's not going to be forever

If you're just going back to your old habits after cutting, you're just gonna re-gain the fat you lost. The trick is to find a happy medium of enjoying what you eat while still being in a deficit. Look up low calorie dense foods and pick what you like. 


Also, being in a deficit doesn't mean you have to starve yourself. Don't cut more than 500 calories/day. 
When you're done cutting, you can just increase your daily calories to your maintanance goal


Btw it doesn't matter if you're cutting fat or carbs. Just cut back calories in general. All macros serve a purpose in your body. Try to keep your protein intake at about 1g/1lbs lean body mass and you should be golden!"
nutrition,Check out the recommended daily magnesium amount and compare it to magnesium rich foods like potatoes and bananas.
nutrition,Any sort of artificial flavorings/colorings are horrible for you. Stay away from them. I believe there's a relatively big gap between how bad certain junk foods are.
nutrition,"Neither. Neither of these are bad or worse. 

Abuse of either of them is."
nutrition,"Add vegetables like watercress, carrots, beetroots, arugula, kale, pumpkin.... they are rich in nutrient and bery low in calories."
nutrition,"Sounds pretty boring and setting yourself up for adherence issues my dude. 

Best way to maintain a decent calorie deficit is slight reduction of calories in and slight increase of calories out. Thereby ensuring youre notnrestrictinf your intake so much so that you end up caving and eating loads more. 

Calories out can be walking, jogging, resistance training, whatever you're able to do based on your body.

Your calories in should include your favourite foods that fit your needs and are nutritionally dense so you're not losing anything. 

500 calorie deficit a day is enough of a deficit to lose 1lb a week if fat loss is your goal."

nutrition,"I eat no fruits and no vegetables. Fruit is just sugar anf vit c, maybe some potassium.. vegetables have some micronutrients but canceled out by high amounts of anti nutrients, toxins, sprayed w herbicides pesticides and more...

nutrition,Soup is a great way to sneak in extra veggies into your diet. If you consume the broth you used to cook them you'll retain the majority of nutrients. A quick-easy meal I cast a vote for soup:)

Would you want to do that? That sounds incredibly boring.

What I simply do is track my calories and aim to hit protein only. The fat and carbs can be any ratio on any day. My meals are varied so its easy to sustain. On top of that I just make sure im including some fruit and lots of veg"

nutrition,Its not just gmo foods its all food including organic. Unless you do biodynamic or regenerative farming. It is a fairly simple concept. The soil has minerals amd nutrients the food extracts it into self. When you dont pay attention to the health of the soil nutrients and minerals get depleted. Modern science answer to this problem has been gmos and herbicides fungicides and a whole other mess of chemicals. The evidence is out there. Just Google nutrient differences in food from the 60s to now.
nutrition,"Oh hei!!! Vegan here :D thyme is really amazing for iron btw 5g of thyme is like 6.7mg of iron and has vit C to help absorb it I recommend getting loads of thyme and adding it to nearly all your savoury dishes like pizza, soup, stir fry rice pasta etc haha 

I recommend you check out plant proof! The site or insta as it's run by a vegan physiotherapist and nutritionist too!!! The podcast plantproof is also fantastic and interviews loads of others who are plantbased :) 

Also tbh for protein - you don't need protein powder unless you're exercising and it's like really great to take after exercising as it's a load of protein to help with recovery in one go. Just eat loads of beans, pasta, bread (for real lol) and you'd be up in 60g~80g easily and also of course modern plant based meat! Quorn! Beyond meat and the like! 

I highly recommend cronometsr since you get to play around with micronutrients too not just macros! (Micronutrients such as iron, potassium, vitamin C, and the like!) Highly recommend you checkout plant proof honestly haha and of course r/vegannutrition!"

However I've noticed since I ran I haven't really lost much weight due to the over eating. 

Should I stop exercising for now? :( 

And focus on continuing to lose weight until I'm in the healthier side of the healthy BMI? At the moment I'm at 22.1 for Asian BMI I'm still at the verge of obesity as it's 24 BMI for Asians and J certainly face wise still look it lol 

Or is it possible for me to magically still run and stay at 1.3kcal without overeating? Will drinking loads of protein powder and water help lol? I usually mix in the protein powder with my smoothie bowls"

Even if you are relatively young, you probably have lots of pain in your body that you have just had for so long that you don't consciously notice it but it's there and it weighs you down. I also think it's because to a kid, everything in the world is still new and exciting so, mentally, they have lots of energy from their need and desire to explore and experience as many new things as they can whereas adults don't have that need or desire as much and therefore can't bring g themselves to muster up that kind of energy."
nutrition,"All sugars are (basically, for simplicity’s sake here) the same but how fast you digest them is extremely important. It’s the fiber in fruit and vegetables that makes their sugars get absorbed slowly for steady energy and fullness, whereas the lack of fiber in processed foods makes that sugar hit your blood stream fast, causing insulin to spike, followed by a sugar crash, fatigue and hunger. I eat a lot more when I eat processed foods than whole foods."

I personally think looking at any food as strictly unhealthy or ""dirty"" is toxic in itself, but anyways. Life is short. Eat some chips. Anyone complaining, ""ah its empty calories mahhh!"", stop.

But if you're eating 5 or 6 times a day then glucose/insulin could easily be raised for a large chunk of the day.

&gt;As you say a number top athletes getting diabetic nowadays, I guess partly from the sheer volume of food they eat. I suspect the long distance runners mostly get away with it since they're skinny and not eating a great deal, but the bulkier types like rowers, swimmers, some cyclists, they're eating a lot of food

If you drink pop you will have an insane spike that doesn't last and you'll crash. Apple will also have more fiber and a different nutrient complex than a nut. If you just eat fats you'll go into ketosis using that as energy as there's no carbs to burn up. Carb energy tends to burn up quick.. Say you eat bread. Spike. High blood sugar and pressure. Crash.

A small amount of sugar requires very little, or essentially no rest. Hence runners eating pure sugar while running. Fat and protein could take hours before you can use the energy. And they're less readily converted to energy. Even after they're in your blood, they don't power high intensity activity particularly well."

""The recommendation to limit dietary saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake has persisted despite mounting evidence to the contrary. Most recent meta-analyses of randomized trials and observational studies found no beneficial effects of reducing SFA intake on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and total mortality, and instead found protective effects against stroke. Although SFAs increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, in most individuals, this is not due to increasing levels of small, dense LDL particles, but rather larger LDL particles, which are much less strongly related to CVD risk. It is also apparent that the health effects of foods cannot be predicted by their content in any nutrient group without considering the overall macronutrient distribution. Whole-fat dairy, unprocessed meat, and dark chocolate are SFA-rich foods with a complex matrix that are not associated with increased risk of CVD. The totality of available evidence does not support further limiting the intake of such foods."""
nutrition,"That's not quite true either but thanks for being rude

Happy to discuss this with anybody that is actually interested"
nutrition,You may find the satiety cascade very informative! Have a read up on that
nutrition,"Satiation is a mechanism that isn't well explored at all.

In addition to that: whether an apple really is more satiating depends highly on the person eating it, their form on the day and what other things they may have eaten.

So your premise isn't always true to begin with."
nutrition,"Yea. . . but they're also going to spike your insulin, making you hungrier. if you want to feel the most satiated you should limit your carb intake to about 20% of your diet, eat more fats, fiber, and protein, and eat as little sugar as you can."

But if I had to guess, it would take your liver longer to digest foods that require the liver to be digested like fructose. Intermittent fasting is great because it limits higher insulin levels to certain times of the day, so if there is an effect I would assume that it would be irrelevant unless you are eating a lot of fructose, such as sugar, corn syrup, or a wicked whole lot of fruits."

nutrition,"The healthiest fats to use are Coconut oil, Lard, and Butter - if your not cooking with it, olive oil is also healthy

Most people think polyunsaturated fats are healthier but this is turning out to not be true according to new research.

So the reason most people think saturated fats are bad is because they are the fats that are clogging arteries. But the saturated fat in your arteries are not dietary fats, they are predominantly fats your body made. If you have clogged arteries and heart disease you almost certainly have metabolic syndrome to some degree, potentially even type 2 diabetes, and you probably have a very high degree of insulin resistance.

Polyunsaturated fats may be causing a portion of the epidemic of disease we see today. And they think it's because your body doesn't always burn these fats, sometimes it uses them in cell walls. Every double bond of carbon on that fat has the potential to create a free radical in the cell wich can cause complications, such as mutations in rna or dna - leading to cancers.

There is actually a frighting correlation between seed oils (such as vegetable oil and soybean oil) and Cancer and alzheimer's. Ill post the source for this when I get home if I remember, but since we have had these 'processed oils' in our diet cancer rate have increased over 30x (which is pretty significant)

Related: there are marine-source MUFAs (cetoleif acid) that raise long-chain omega 3s better than the omega 3s themselves!!

what?? it's the other way around

your claim entails the belief that junk such as soybean, corn, canola, sunflower oils are better than olive oil. that's absurd"
nutrition,"Well I know a lot of foods that aren't very satiating have a high sugar/carbohydrate content, which can spike insulin levels and make you hungrier. That's why you can eat a whole tube of pringles and why you always have room for that last slice of pizza. 

Ive heard that Carbs can also inflate the stomach making more room for themselves there. Which is why some people can eat Chinese food or cake until they're sick. (But I heard this a couple years ago and don't know how true it is)

Things that have the highest satiation levels are foods that take time to digest ie proteins, and fiberous foods. And eating foods like fats, that don't spike insulin, will keep you fuller longer.

It's worth noting that not all carbs spike insulin. If you take in fructose but no glucose, your liver has to convert it into glucose before your body can use it. So some fruits like apples, with a higher fructose content and a higher fiber content, seem more filling than say peanut butter with added sugar"
nutrition,"Satiety involves many factors: volume, water content, fiber, [food psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_(physiology)#Psychological_factors) , etc. Foods with the most satiation per calorie:

* high in certain [proteinase inhibitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinase_inhibitors_in_plants) that suppress appetite - eg potatoes[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satiety_value#cite_note-7)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satiety_value#cite_note-8)
* high in [protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_leverage_hypothesis) (which takes longer to digest than other energy sources) - eg meat

most nutritional organizations agree that the consumption of saturated fats should be decreased and polyunsaturated fats and ω-3 FA consumption should be increased."
nutrition,"https://www.nutritionaction.com/daily/fat-in-food/does-cooking-make-your-oil-dangerous/

“For the amount of time you’re going to cook, and the temperatures you’re going to get to, your oil is not going to undergo oxidation,” explains Eric Decker, an oil expert and chair of the department of food sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

So fear of frying is no reason to stop using monounsaturated oils (olive, peanut, canola) or polyunsaturated oils (soy, corn, sunflower), which lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, and switch to coconut oil, which raises LDL.

Some oils do hold up better at high temperatures, though. Any oil starts to degrade once it reaches its smoke point, which varies from oil to oil. “If you put oil in the pan and heat it too much or let it go too long, the oil starts smoking,” Decker says.

Do oils ever become oxidized? Yes, but it’s easy to tell when that happens. “When oxidation occurs, the fatty acids break into small molecules, which have a smell,” says Decker. “That’s what we call rancidity.”

But a high temperature isn’t the biggest cause of oxidation, says Decker. It’s time."
nutrition,Yeah you’re absolutely right. I should have said “a” reason rather than “the” reason. There are so many things that impact appetites and over eating.
nutrition,"I think your statement is more of an oversimplification than mine. I'm happy to go deeper into the nuances. Saturated fats tend to raise HDL (good cholesterol) levels and are not clearly implicated in risk of heart disease. For heating purposes they are definitely better than PUFA oils

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30336600/

""These results suggest that heated palm oil confers protection against the onset of atherosclerosis compared to heated polyunsaturated oils in a rabbit model. """
nutrition,Protein and creatine. Too it off with a good multi and maybe fish oil
nutrition,"Unfortunately these are rumours that just aren't true

&gt;high pufa content is healthier than high mufa content

PUFA are unstable under heat and generates harmful oxidation products. Furthermore olive oil (MUFA) beats other oils in all health comparisons

see https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32147453/

**Olive Oil Consumption and Cardiovascular Risk in U.S. Adults**

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7254282/

""Exposure of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-rich culinary oils (COs) to high temperature frying practices generates high concentrations of cytotoxic and genotoxic lipid oxidation products (LOPs) via oxygen-fueled, recycling peroxidative bursts. These toxins, including aldehydes and epoxy-fatty acids, readily penetrate into fried foods and hence are available for human consumption; therefore, they may pose substantial health hazards. Although previous reports have claimed health benefits offered by the use of PUFA-laden COs for frying purposes, these may be erroneous in view of their failure to consider the negating adverse public health threats presented by food-transferable LOPs therein""

&gt;Smoke point is important in health because heating an oil past smoke point generates free radicals

Can you please provide a citation for this. PUFAs generate harmful oxidation products even below the smoke point

&gt;Sad how combative people are here when they’re so blatantly wrong

You're the one being rude about this, bud"
nutrition,Saturated fats are fine in moderation but to say they aren’t unhealthy is kind of an oversimplification. Saturated fats in excess drive up cholesterol levels and ldl specifically.
nutrition,"These are some of the major culprits, although another answer also noted receptors that detect stretch. 

Effing hormones, dude.

Also, given that hunger and thirst are often confused for each other, someone not feeling satiated after eating could partly be caused by dehydration."
nutrition,"Well, if that's the case then they made an error on the packaging. So then it would be about 500mg per tablet... Still high, relatively speaking."
nutrition,It’s great for cooking and high pufa content is healthier than high mufa content so you’re wrong in both aspects. Smoke point is important in health because heating an oil past smoke point generates free radicals
nutrition,"Grapeseed oil is a bad choice for heating. Smoke point doesn't really matter, for thermal stability you just want an oil with low polyunsaturated fat content. The multiple double bonds in PUFAs are simply way more reactive, and that's true at any temperature even below smoke point."
nutrition,"Extra Virgin Olive Oil has the largest amount of research demonstrating clear benefits and a long history of use in large quantities in healthy cultures. It has a nice amount of antioxidant polyphenols, and since it is monounsaturated, is stable under heat.

Polyunsaturated oils are unstable under heat. They also usually have a lot of omega 6 which isn't a good idea to eat in large quantities as it worsens your omega 6:3 ratio. Canola (rapeseed) oil is the only one with a good 6:3 ratio, I consider it the best of the cheap oils.

Saturated fats are not unhealthy and so you can also consider coconut oil, red palm oil, ghee and tallow to be good choices for cooking. But that's unfortunately still controversial so to keep your doctor happy you might just want to get a good quality olive oil."
nutrition,Sounds like a typo!
nutrition,The hunger hormones leptin &amp; ghrelin have more to do with satiety than the number of calories you eat. They are also the reason overweight people have more trouble controlling their appetites than people who are thinner.
nutrition,"Expeller pressed oils are best because they aren’t heated during extraction. Olive oil is healthy uncooked. For cooking grape seed is good for its high smoke point. Avocado, coconut, hempseed and sesame oil are all good too."
nutrition,Sad to see that this is an unpopular opinion in a nutrition sub.
nutrition,"The bun, and anything containing sugar. Saturated fat is not unhealthy."
nutrition,"Calories and satiation are not the same thing. The sense of fullness varies from person to person, but can largely be based off of the volume of the food as opposed to the caloric density of the food. This is the primary danger in consuming many calorically dense foods in that they’re often not satiating, but come at a expensive nutritional cost. However, because you’re not satiated, you want to eat more. I think you’re just confusing caloric consumption and satiation in your mind when they’re not the same thing"
nutrition,One of the main mechanisms driving the feeling of satiety from eating is activation of stretch receptors in the stomach.  Eating a tablespoon of oil will not stretch the stomach at all. Eating an apple will.
nutrition,Energy is not the only factor in satiety it's more complex.
nutrition,You eat less than 20-30 gm of carbs  to be in ketosis(ketone production from fats which is used instead of glucose) not to lose more fat.Being in ketosis is said to better satiety and prevent overeating and certain other benefits.
nutrition,"Extra virgin olive oil is probably the only one that is most accepted across different disciplines and diets and research. 

Everything else really varies. Some stuff show that canola, sunflower, grapeseed are good. Others say bad. 
Some say butter and coconut oil are good. Other say bad. 
It's kind of all over. 
Again, EVOO seems to be quite good overall, though it is important to still consider the context and caloric density to avoid overuse. Try to get healthy fats from minimally processed nuts, seeds, avocados and if you eat animal products, leaner meats and fatty fish."
nutrition,Fats provide satiety to a far greater extent than carbs or protein.
nutrition,There are health benefits to ketosis - not everything is about weight loss.
nutrition,"Different macronutrients fuel the body differently. Overall, protein is the most satiating. Carbohydrates provide quick fuel, so you feel satisfied at first, but hungry again soon after. Then high-volume, low call foods can give you a ""full"" feeling without eating too much. 


Fats are important too, but honestly I usually just do a lazy low-fat diet. Since fat is high in calories and low in satiation (in my option) I prefer to focus my diet on primarily protein and high-volume lowcal options, with a little carbs (usually 100 cals/meal) for balance. 


I am not a nutritionist, if someone can correct any mistakes please do. Some of these recommendations are anecdotal, I definitely encourage everyone to choose the diet that's best for their lifestyle."
nutrition,They don't need to be combined to be fully used. You just can't rely on only one for protein for your whole life. Eating a varied diet is enough.
nutrition,Rice is pretty low in protein. Whole wheat bread and oats are much higher.
nutrition,all of it as a whole honestly. It has little nutrition for a lot of calories and fat. Each but each component can be healthy if you use it correctly.
nutrition,"This isn't very well studied in my opinion and it's biochemistry so it's complex. 

Generally, the body is protein sparing - it tries not to tear down muscles or other structure unless it doesn't have another source. If it has fat to burn and can do it effectively, the leftover glycerol will all be consumed to make glucose. 

For exercise, it's complicated. I'll take two extremes:

An athlete who always trains with high glucose availability - they eat carbs burn/during exercise - will be good at burning carbs and poor at burning fat. That means their glycogen stores are used up more quickly and they have less glycerol to make more glucose, so if the exercise is long enough, they will end up depleting all their glycogen. This is the dreaded ""bonk"" - when you run out of liver glycogen and you aren't making enough glucose to keep going. It's not fun at all; your power output drops drastically and you get confused, so it can be dangerous. I once rode 45 minutes in this state at 10 mph and passed 5 different stores before I realized that if I stopped at the mini mart I could eat something and that might help. In that sort of state, your body is definitely tearing down muscle, but you don't need to be that low for it to happen.

An athlete who regularly trains with limited glucose availability - fasted training is best - and trains at a low enough intensity can be quite good at burning fat. That means they burn less glucose so their glycogen reserves last longer, and they have more glycerol to be converted to glucose, so they can last much longer - at some intensities, they can just keep going without worry of running out of glycogen.

There was a group of 8 runners last summer who ran 100 miles over 5 days without eating."
nutrition,Mustard is good for you.
nutrition,I was wondering if it was like a switch or more of a ratio thing so this answer is very helpful.
nutrition,"""For people with normal metabolism - those that are insulin sensitive - when they eat carbs, their blood glucose goes up and their insulin goes up. The body responds by trying to burn as much of the extra glucose as possible, so it turns down fat metabolism.""

Do you know how many grams of carbs you need to eat to cause insulin to rise sufficiently that it turns down fat metabolism? I'm sure it varies from person to person but just wondering if there is a average figure. I'd also assume it depends on how quickly your body metabolizes the carbs so that high glycemic index foods cause it to happen more than low glycemic index foods?"
nutrition,Sure but who on earth is eating 12 ounces of ketchup? That's like half the bottle. Takes me a month to go through that amount.
nutrition,"If you have a soy allergy you can still eat a whole food plant based diet. There are so many different types of beans I’ve lost count.

If you have SIBO you can eat a WFPB diet. It would most likely be beneficial to you since animal products seem to create worse gut flora. You can be WFPb with celiac, just avoid gluten and nutritional yeast.

Some diets might need special tweaking. None of them require keto or carnivore diets though. Just keeping with the original post and not going into whether one person should eat or ignore broccoli.

Avocados tend to upset my stomach so I don’t eat them. That doesn’t mean an all meat diet can be healthy."
nutrition,"In a situation like that the body is going to be in mixed mode, burning some carbs and some fat, trying to store either one if possible. The keto line is not a switch, it’s more like a dimmer threshold. Your body is never in a situation where it’s burning 100% from carbs OR fat."
nutrition,"So if you eat say 100g of carbs, 100g of fat, and 100g of protein in a meal and that is your only meal for the day, how does your body burn that? Does it start burning a small portion of the carbs to fuel you for the next hour or few hours and start storing the rest because of the insulin response? But that won't sustain the body for the day so after it burns through those initial carbs that are immediately utilized, it would then pull those stored carbs right? Because that is the preferred fuel source? And because your total carbs for the day is only 400 calories, wouldn't you burn through it relatively quickly and then only other mechanisms are left?

Like it seems like whether you eat 30g or 100g, your body would burn through it all regardless and then would still have to burn fat or something else such as excess protein."
nutrition,"Depends. Bread has a lot of sugar. But the mean you make it with, has all types of ingredients in it too, and a good burger will have sugar in the meat too"
nutrition,"Diets are all meassured in cost/benefit for what they provide towards certain objective. Maybe eating raw broccoli sprouts adds you 5 more years of life, but you don't like their taste or actually settle you uncomfortable through some time of the day.

I'd add more tangible examples than extreme hunger, if you have soy allergy and celiac, and/or SIBO, or some other digestive issues, diets that need special tweeking and restrictions are going to calculate the cost benefit of adding something."
nutrition,"If you're looking for ways to manage your cycle and hormones, I'd suggest Vitti's Woman Code. Explains clearly why some foods are better or better avoided depending on where you are on your period timeline."
nutrition,What determines where the glucose from gluconeogenesis comes from? Like generally you'd want to avoid it tearing down muscle and instead prefer it takes it from glycerol but what determines which source it pulls from?
nutrition,"Oh no, I’m sorry. I meant people in general. I’m in the field and see so many arguing in favor of keto when for most it’s just more restriction. You hear so many with survivorship bias saying it’s the greatest thing but it’s only those who successfully snuck through. Keto is a questionable idea for mostly everyone who tries it."
nutrition,"I could see how carnivore diet could be useful if you’re stranded at sea without food and want to keep surviving so you eat the person next to you. It’s happened before and saved someone’s life. Maybe people don’t want to live a long time.

When I hear the word “healthy” I think of long term health. When others hear the term I guess their mind goes elsewhere to “in the event of a catastrophe when I can no longer access fresh fruits and vegetables”."
nutrition,"There are two effects going on.

For people with normal metabolism - those that are insulin sensitive - when they eat carbs, their blood glucose goes up and their insulin goes up. The body responds by trying to burn as much of the extra glucose as possible, so it turns down fat metabolism. Once blood glucose goes back to normal, insulin goes back to normal, and fat can once again be burned.

For those who are insulin resistant, it's different because they have hyperinsulinemia - their insulin is always high because their liver is making unwanted glucose. The means their fat burning is blocked most of the time, so they typically gain weight and end up with high triglycerides.

For people who are insulin resistant, if they go on a keto diet - or do some fasting protocols - they go into ketosis and the unwanted glucose becomes wanted. They are no longer hyperinsulinemic and can lose weight.

That's an oversimplification, but that's the basic idea."
nutrition,"Your body is good at stashing carbs throughout your body, in glycogen stores and as blood sugar. That’s why keto induction takes a few days. All of those reserves have to be depleted, and every time you eat enough carbs to produce an insulin response the glycogen storing mechanisms start stashing."
nutrition,"I hear you. This isn't meant as pushing keto. I don't do keto myself as I enjoy food with carbs in moderation and &lt;30g of carbs isn't necessary to lose fat or be in good shape.

I'm more asking to try to better understand how it all works. When I've read or listened to nutrition stuff this was a question that kept popping into my head so I thought I'd try to find an answer."
nutrition,Ketchup has more sugar per ounce than a soda.
nutrition,Most likely yes but I’m not 100% sure
nutrition,"It is more than just you tubers who challenge the saturated fat hypothesis. It’s also the industries that sell products high in saturated fat. They make trillions of dollars combined per year and they fund research in many universities.

And saturated fat from whole plant sources is more healthful than saturated fat from animal sources when found in Whole Foods and when not isolated. Think whole coconuts compared to beef. 

So it’s complicated because saturated fat isn’t necessarily the bad guy, it’s more the animal products and the animal agriculture industry has plenty of money to publish studies and confuse you."
nutrition,"Interesting! So this is the case with canola and other monounsaturated fatty acids too, then?"
nutrition,"There are two main tissues that can't burn fat.

Red blood cells can't burn fat because they don't have mitochondria. 

The brain can't burn fat because of the blood/brain barrier; fatty acids are big and they can't make it into the blood cells because of their size.

So the body needs an alternate plan when there isn't enough incoming carbohydrate. It does two things.

First, the liver performs the first step of fat-burning, converts the product of that (Acetyl CoA) into ketones, and releases them into the bloodstream. Ketones are small enough to pass the blood/brain barrier, and the brain cells can therefore metabolize them, finishing the second step of fat burning. 

That reduces the need for glucose in the brain, but the brain still needs some glucose and the red blood cells do as well.

That glucose is supplied through gluconeogenesis; the liver can make glucose. It does this by converting amino acids (generally, excess protein, but it can tear down muscles if necessary), glycerol (left over from when burning fat), and lactate (leftover from burning glucose) into glucose. 

Those two mechanisms are how humans can survive during an extended fast, and they both apply on a keto diet as well. 

To answer your question, the body doesn't go into ketosis until it has switched all the other machinery - the cells that can burn either fat or glucose - over to burning fat."
nutrition,"I agree there might be an ideal diet for each animal, but I think it might comprise foods according to activities, not just looking for long term life and reaching maximum age."
nutrition,"Man it’s like a religion in this place. The point I made was it’s more than you tubers who challenge the saturated fat hypothesis. 

And addressing the straw man you’re responding to, I’ll say is it’s nearly impossible to pinpoint the effect of a nutrient or food on your body. And just as many smart people critique the studies linking saturated fat to mortality. But if you extract some value from nutrient zealotry, enjoy yourself."
nutrition,I’m still unsure why we have a lot of people pushing keto when we know you can still lose fat while eating carbs and adhering to the correct energy balance.
nutrition,"Most of us including us who are on ketogenic diets for a long period of time, aren't actually metabolically flexible. Meaning that, our bodies, whether run on carbs or fats via ketones, prefer either one of them and commit.

Carbs are addicted in a good way, meaning that it makes everything easier if not healthier. Because in the nature as we have evolved, there were a handful of simple carb sources if not close to zero, hence the evolution took it's place to be either run on fully fat on the body or via some sort of glucose coming from outside. This mechanism allowed us to find places that were rich in quick source of energy, carbs.

Not to mention that insulin stops ketones production, so eating high carb foods even they are healthy, will stop ketosis."

What if you're only eating 1 meal a day so your body isn't getting a trickle of carbs at multiple times throughout the day? I would think if carbs are the normal fuel that gets burned first, it would burn through it all first and then switch, so whether you eat 50 or 100g or carbs for that meal, it wouldn't matter as much?"

Not sure if you’ve read T Colin Campbells research but caesin protein promoted cancer growth in the presence of a cancer causing agent (aflatoxin). When they did the study with soy protein and wheat protein they did not see the effect.

Here’s where it gets interesting, the repeated the study but this time gave rats genetically engineered wheat to be a complete protein. They developed cancer just like the caesin group. It’s thought the fact that it is a complete protein might actually fuel cancer growth.

nutrition,"Think of it like a heat pump with two fuel modes:  normal and emergency/auxiliary.  Emergency fuel switch on whenever normal fuel stops coming in.  But if there's a trickle of normal fuel, the system will keep switching back into normal mode, depleting that fuel, and then switching back to auxiliary.  For the purposes of our bodies and keto, we don't want the body to keep switching back and forth.  For the liver to produce ketones, the auxiliary fuel, there has to be so little normal fuel that it stays on emergency mode.

Carbs are super easy to digest and convert into energy so your body, like a junkie, will always max out on those.  Whereas it will ignore/store fat if it wants to, because fat is harder to burn.

This baseline is really different for different people, I know people that will drop out of keto if they do more than 30g in a day.  I can go as high as 60+ or more if I'm physically active."

They have recently discontinued so I switched to a local brand in my supermarket called [Jack Rabbit Black beans](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/e3fe732a-441e-4f72-b3fb-47cfbfb3acb2.1b816ca0fcfac08a37b0284fb726657e.jpeg)

Now both are both just one ingredient with no additives -- black beans. But Jack Rabbit's calories are way way lower. It seems like they subtract the fiber content from their final calorie count.

I count my calories religiously, so does this mean that BRM's calorie content was actually lower than it presented and I was actually ingesting less calories than I thought?

I tried to do more research into this and it seems like black bean's fiber content is only half insoluble and half soluble, so only half the fiber should be subtracted... I'm not sure.

Which label is more accurate? Would appreciate any feedback."

Vitamin K1 facilitates healthy blood clotting. Vitamin K1 is in leafy greens. Vitamin K1 has no connection with Vitamin K2 and no calcium management abilities. So forget about leafy greens as a solution for Vitamin K2.

Vitamin K2 comes from animal products in a natural diet. 

Vitamin K2 can be produced from fermenting certain plants with molds. The Japanese Katto is mold fermented beans and has high K2 levels. I think fermented sour crout does too. You should check that out. Otherwise, your digestive system does produce a little fermented K2.

Never discuss Vitamin K. Always be explicit and discuss Vitamin K2. When they first started giving out letters for Vitamins, they were not very good at identifying molecules.

nutrition,"I think your point(s) are overwhelming valid, and I’m curious as to how you think we’d get most people to eat more mindfully, which effectively alters consumer demand. Also, you said we need to improve our legislation and regulate companies, yet most blatantly unhealthy companies are running the regulators. As special interest groups lobbying for power over legislation, they not only invest in politicians willing and able to provide policies beneficial to increasing shareholder profit, but they also suffocate any meaningful attempt to pass legislation aimed at establishing sufficient grounds for change. How do you solve this?

I’ve always thought food was locked away. I was born into a concrete jungle like most modern people, where food comes from the grocery store, instead of the land, while warmth comes from the furnace, rather than trees or coal. I never see the underbelly of where my food comes from, and I have no ownership of the resources, supply chain, and distribution systems. My only position is a consumer in this extremely complex way of supplying the most basic needs for people. At some point, people will suffer from cultural amnesia, where they not only forget what eating mindfully feels and looks like, but the people and companies around them will also morph the landscape enough to literally lock food away, while providing a limited selection of goods, and force you to work for their products. By the time you saved enough for land/freedom, you’ve already lost the connection between food, the natural world, and you as an animal.

While I understand your argument about why people need to shift the burden of responsibility less on companies and more on themselves, especially because we as individuals started the fire, I’m not sure if “putting out the fire” when it no longer needs to burn is as possible as putting out a fire of a burning house. For example, what if the gasoline for the fire isn’t limited or regulated? What if it keep materializing as fast as the fire burns? More specifically, if the demand is the problem, and people cause the demand, and there is no limit to how many people there are, then there is no limit to the demand, so no legislation can possibly keep up with ever increasing demand. How do you solve this?"
nutrition,"&gt;Your points about personal choices, freedom, consumer demand, corporate leadership, profit motive, etc, are the identical arguments cigarette companies used for decades here in the US

I feel like maybe I'm not conveying my point well then. 

I'm not saying that companies (such as food companies or cigarette companies), shouldn't be regulated. Quite the opposite. I'm saying it's not sensible to expect a company to act in any interest other than earning money, and therefore they absolutely *should* be regulated. I probably would advocate much more severe regulations that the average person.

Mine is a point about blame.

If you have a pet bear and you bring him to your job at the mall with you, and he mauls a ton of people, it's stupid to say ""That bear doesn't care about the welfare of the people at the mall at all!"".

It's true though. The bear doesn't care about the welfare of people, but the question is *why the fuck was the bear put in the position to do this in the first place?*. It's not really the bear's fault. If we punish the bear it's not going to stop mauling people. There's no reason to hate bears. It's just a bear, that's what it does.

I feel the same about the phrase ""They want your money and don’t care about your health to get it."" Strictly speaking, it's true. But it elicits this sense that companies are evil and responsible for this.

But in order to believe that, then you have to believe that companies are responsible for the health of people, which is something that no one believes anymore than they believe that the bear is responsible for the welfare of the shoppers at the mall.

If we focus on the bear, we might think ""Oh if we punish the bear enough, then this will never happen again"", or ""Bears are the problem completely, they're inherently evil, so let's go to the woods and kill them all"", or ""It was just that one evil bear. not all bears are like this. I'm going to make sure I only deal with responsible bears from now on when I bring bears to the mall"".

All of those are completely bonkers, but people say exactly the same things with companies. ""We should fine the companies for being amoral so that they never do it again"", or ""End companies completely the state should do everything in a centrally planned way"" or ""I don't buy from evil companies, I give my money to companies that don't just want my money"".

But it's all completely off base. A bear will do what a bear does. And a company will do what a company does, which is prioritise profits.

The 'Freedom' people that I feel like you're alluding to might say that this is ""natural"" or something and that we should let it happen. ""The strongest mall shoppers won't get mauled"" or something. I don't support that, I think that's stupid.

Instead, I want the bear kept at home. Or better yet, not kept as a pet at all. I want to let the bear be a bear so that we don't have a situation to be angry with the bear for being a bear in the first place.

Similarly, I want companies to be *regulated*. I don't want cigarette companies telling us what is or isn't healthy at all. Of course, they're going to say whatever they need to say to get us to buy more cigarettes. That's exactly what they've been set up to do.

When you see something advertising itself as ""healthy"" when it's simply just sugar. Like a tic tac saying 0 calories or something, we should be asking ""Who the fuck let that bear in here and allowed this?"". If we go after tic tacs in some moral sense, like giving the CEO bad press on Twitter or something, or fining the company, then the company is just going to drop the person we've decided to pin this on, and then set up some ""Tic tacs for health"" ad campaign, and sell us Tic Tac sports wear made in Bangladeshi sweatshops, and sell aspartame and stevia tic tacs (""that are actually 0 calories, unlike some leading brands""), or whatever. 

Instead, we should go for the legislation. And improve advertising legislation, and also simultaneously be a little smarter at home, so that we don't fall for that bullshit."

Go read this: 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5786199/

*Compared to investigations on hypocaloric diets, the effects of chronic overfeeding have been less studied. It has been posited that consuming calories in excess of daily caloric requirements will result in a gain in body weight and in particular fat mass regardless of which macronutrient(s) are consumed. However, recent evidence suggests that there is a quantitative difference in protein versus carbohydrate and/or fat overfeeding as it relates to body composition. Protein overfeeding or the consumption of a high protein diet may not result in a gain in body weight or fat mass despite consuming calories that exceed one’s normal or habitual intake. Therefore, this review will provide an up-to-date narrative on the current scientific literature on various combinations of macronutrient overfeeding and its effects on body composition.*

Most people (e.g. Americans to Europeans, and Europeans to Americans) have a limited experience with other places through visits, exports, and media, and we all tend to turn our limited experiences into broad generalizations about those places.

Hence why people from outside the US often assume Americans eat nothing but fast food and don't have any cultural food practices."

nutrition,"There is a reason almost no athletes eat low carb. Or if they do eat low carb generally, they eat carbs before exercise."
nutrition,"Carbs provide fast and quickly available energy. Also a lot of foods that contain carbs are high in vitamins or other micro nutrients. Therefore it's recomended to eat about 50-55% of your calories from carbs. 
You can do keto or low carb but if you feel a lack of energy through your training this might be a sign that you body is missing them.
Keto basically forces your body to get your energy from fat (by building the needed carbs from protein and fat) but feeling tired through workouts is a possible side effect."

nutrition,"White pasta and basmati rice have a similar gi index from what I’ve seen, both have a gi index or around 50-58, which is considered low.

When eating a mixed meal with other things it it(fat, protein, fiber), the total glycemic index of the meal is lowered. If you have white rice(a high gi carb) with spinach, steak, and avocado, the overall glycemic impact of the meal wouldn’t be as much. It might be a better choice to eat a slower digesting carb a few hours before, but having something higher gi as part of a balanced meal a few hours beforehand is also fine.

Unless you’re exercising twice a day, you don’t have to worry about rapid glycogen replenishment. Just eat some carbs after your workout. If you want to eat some high gi carb, this would be the best time to do it"

This is good, because there is a category of people in society you can't convince with facts and reason. When the cause and end result is good I'm all for a bit of emotional conviction.

I don't sear the meat and just microwave to heat it up, mainly because I'm lazy. There is also a concern of microplastic and plastic leeching when using sous vide and I cook at 60c/140f for 2 to 3 hours. Assuming higher heat will have more leeching."

The other claims you're making here - about beta-carotene&gt;&gt;retinol and cholesterol - are both unsupported (and unsupport*able*) and also conflict with basic evolutionary theory. The human body does not come with a manual to let us know how much of a substance is ""enough""; that is a judgment call being made by individuals based on various belief structures. Nature itself is not subject to the belief structure problem (nor is natural selection), and so the behavior of species in natural settings is a more reliable guide than scientific modeling. The human lineage has about 3.5 million years of increasing animal consumption beyond whatever was normal for the Last Common Ancestor, and if reliance on retinol and exogenous cholesterol had *not* increased over that time, that would put those two bodily needs somehow outside of the normal evolutionary processes, meaning that for your beliefs to be true evolution would have to either be wrong, or there would have to be some sort of magic operating to make reality turn out the way you want it to. And you are not 3.5 million years old. 

The answer you your overall question - is a vegan diet adequate for all life stages (of humans) - is no, a diet which excludes animal foods is not appropriate for *any* life stages of humans. We know this because pre-agricultural humans do not appear to have *ever* relied upon animal-exclusionary diets for any of their individuals, and agricultural diets all appear to have resulted in worse health outcomes for their subjects. If a non-agricultural animal-exclusionary diet were ever even *adequate* much less optimal, there should be evidence for countless human populations adopting it and maintaining it well into historical times, simply because plants do not run away or fight back and that food capture strategy would therefore be far more efficient than a hunting-gathering strategy. However, the only evidence for prehistoric animal-exclusionary humans I am aware of is a small group of *Neanderthals* who were *probably* eating an animal-exclusionary diet for at least the *last part of their lives*."

nutrition,"I feel like that’s an unfair simplification that vilifies all companies and puts 100% of the blame on other people for our own food choices.

It’s true that companies don’t care about your health, and “want” your money in some sense. But that’s like saying that fire doesn’t care about your health and wants fuel to burn. We don’t personify and characterise fire the way we do “companies”.

Like even after someone’s house burns down we don’t say, “That fucking fire, it didn’t care about anything, it just wanted to burn things”. Though it’s kinda true, it’s also kinda silly to say. And if we thought that way, we might start thinking that fire should have a responsibility to know not to burn through California forests, because people live there, and maybe we should try to punish fire if it does. It would be completely insane to approach it that way.

First of all, fire happens naturally. If you don’t really do anything about it, it will spontaneously pop up in lots of unexpected places (e.g. a hay bale can spontaneously combust). Companies are no different. People will sell and trade shit even if you don’t set up any structure (e.g. even in the Soviet Union where it was illegal, black markets sold things like shoes and groceries).

Secondly, we need fire. It’s in our furnaces, our engines, on gas stoves. But it’s best when it’s highly regulated and controlled and directed. Companies are the same way, they’re necessary.

The reason a company sells sugary things and calls it healthy, is because we buy it. More over, if they don’t sell it, we fucking demand it. If they sold just overtly sugary treats, we’d say “do you have anything healthy in here?”. Plenty of stores and restaurants have been criticised for not advertising any healthy foods, despite being more or less honest about the health qualities of what they sell. 

And if they sell only healthy stuff, we’d want it to taste better, which is just another way of saying that we want more fat, salt, and sugar on it. It’s not a coincidence that we have salads and then put breaded deep fried chicken on it and drizzle it with a dressing that is essentially jam or mayonnaise, and then we eat the chicken and maybe a tomato, and throw out all that crappy lettuce at the bottom.

I don’t feel like it’s “companies” fault for taking our our demand, and a bunch of resources, and turning it into garbage and fat people, any more than I think it’s fires fault for taking oxygen and a house full of memories and turning it into ash and 3rd degree burns.

If we keep standing outside burned down houses and say “it’s so unfair, I just wanted a cool looking bedroom, so I brought 30 candles in and went to sleep, but the fire didn’t care. It’s all the fires fault”, we’re never going to change things.

We have to improve our legislations and regulate companies more, but also rethink our expectations of what we think companies do and where responsibility lies for things. If we get mad at a company for doing something bad for society and characterise it as greedy, then we’re implicitly saying that we expect a company to not do that on its own volition, which is ridiculous, since literally everything is set up to make it do that, and only that. It’s like expecting fire not to ignite gasoline because it would hurt people."

For one, butter has a lot more 18:1 (oleic) and 18:0 (stearic). While coconut is rich in MCTS of 8:0-12:0 which have their own interesting effects.

It's not clear to me which is healthier. For high heat cooking coconut is definitely more stable, the proteins in butter burn quite easily."

I suppose I could agree, if you want, that the evidence out there on the topic of oils and long term health effects is minimal so we're all just making loose inferences. But on the basis of existing data, it really does seem fine.

nutrition,"There are few items at places like Walmart and Kroger that *don’t* have added sugars. I got so determined to find 0g of added sugars that I now shop at Sprout’s for even a fighting chance of finding anything.

It’s a problem. They market “healthy” food in minimalistic, green packaging to make you think something is good for you. Then they have the audacity to say things as a selling point like “Made with REAL sugar!” or “No artificial sweeteners!” which are mostly just blaring sirens telling the world that they loaded their product with sugar and it trying to make excuses for it. 

I’d say a massive amount of people don’t understand what they are really buying. I remember a while ago, I bought a bag of those Brookside chocolate covered blueberries because I thought it was a healthy snack alternative with less sugar and more nutrients. I trusted the packaging without thinking about it, and saw blueberry and açai, and thought “Yo, this seems healthy”. Yikes. I got a small bag when I visited my parents recently, and they have something like 17g of total sugars, *all of which are added sugars*. Come to find out that Brookside is owned by Hersheys, which completely explains the atrocious amount of sugars. 

After having been trying to reduce my added sugar intake, I have noticed that I don’t even want sugary stuff now, it just makes me feel like shit. This is exactly what companies don’t want; I’m one less potential customer for them. This is why they have to hide the truth of what’s in their products. They don’t, and never will, care about your health. All that matters to them is money and instilling sugar addiction across the country (no matter where you are, tbh) so they have returning buyers. I know we all know this, but it just pisses me off.

I now just have 70% dark chocolate if I want something sweet for the most part. Otherwise, grapes and berries are my go-to. Nature’s candy! People have become so unknowingly addicted to sugar and accustomed to an ultra-sweet palate, so it’s almost too daunting for people to find mindful alternatives because things just don’t “taste as good” and so they give up before even trying.

I tend to meal prep for the week ahead on Sunday and repeatedly pull up the app when modifying recipes to fit my desired macros. Heavy Coconut Cream instead of whipping cream, buckwheat/bulgur instead or rice etc. It's very fast in a pinch.

But what i love most is the ability to add items yourself. Especially items you tend to use a lot. For example Fat Free Chobani Yogurt might be in the app already but the preset serving sizes can be awkward to count. 170g is no good when you're trying to measure 1/3cup...so you just add your own item with whatever serving size makes sense to you.

The Calorie Control Council, established in 1966, is an international association representing the low- and reduced-calorie food and beverage industry. Today it represents manufacturers and suppliers of low- and reduced-calorie foods and beverages, including manufacturers and suppliers of more than two dozen different alternative sweeteners, fibers and other low-calorie, dietary ingredients. Council staff includes experts certified in public health, food and nutrition. ([https://caloriecontrol.org/about/](https://caloriecontrol.org/about/))

nutrition,Thank u!
nutrition,"There are lots of psychological triggers for binge eating: periods of stress in your life, boredom, negative self body image, eating too little in a diet and prevalence of bad emotions. 

I can give you a little insight from my own personal experience. I used to eat a lot of junk food and drink tons of beers everyday, got to 230 pounds (5'7''), so one day i said enough is enough, and decided to change my eating habits. It's hard on the begining, but you must understand that weight loss happens over a long period of time, it won't happen overnight, in the same way you didn't gain weight overnight. So just take it easy, try to fix one bad habit at a time, don't think you can change everything at once, take your time, and the most important thing is: when you think you screwed everything and wanna give up, **don't**. Tomorrow is another day to keep fixing yourself

Also, keep a realistic and reasonable diet, the best diet is the one you can follow for the longest time, not the one with lowest calories. I suggest going to a dietitian for a nice and well planned diet that works for you, once you rebuild your eating habits your life will change for the best."
nutrition,"It’s important to consider though, that sugar making things taste delicious makes it harder to moderate. If you moderate too much and cut back, you can experience withdrawal symptoms, making you want more. 

Also sugar has a leptin-blocking effect that can keep you feeling hungry, contributing to the problem of trying to moderate it!"
nutrition,"The general path that sugar (i.e. sucrose, glucose-fructose, dextrose) takes through the body can be summarized as such: sugar ingestion -&gt; rapid absorption of glucose and other monosaccharides into bloodstream -&gt; rapid rise in blood glucose levels -&gt; rapid rise in insulin levels -&gt; insulin signals transport of glucose into tissues (muscles, adipose, brain, etc) -&gt; decrease in blood glucose levels -&gt; decrease in insulin levels. When blood glucose and insulin levels are not properly regulated, disease can follow.

To start, here's a (over)simplified analogy for what happens when different macronutrients are ingested. Imagine your body is a campfire. You are constantly ""burning"" energy and creating heat, though at a much slower and controlled pace than a fire. Having a solid meal with whole grains, protein, and vegetables is like throwing large log onto the fire: it will burn slowly over the course of several hours. In contrast, having a sugary drink is kind of like throwing some newspaper into the fire: it burns hot but disappears quickly. There is nothing inherently wrong with this - what makes sugar potentially harmful really comes down to the state your body is in when you ingest it, how much you eat, and how often you eat it.

Although sugar is not as energy dense as dietary fat on a calorie/gram basis, it is easily absorbed, transported, metabolized by all tissues in the body. Most importantly in the context of its effects on human health is that it triggers the release of the hormone insulin. Being a hormone, it has widespread and non-specific effects throughout the body. Looking at metabolic disorders can help us to understand the importance of insulin. Someone with type-1 diabetes may not be able to produce enough (or any) insulin to help tissues absorb glucose, and would need to inject themselves with insulin to prevent chronically high blood sugar (which is very bad). Someone with type-2 diabetes may produce enough (or too much) insulin, but their cells may not respond properly to this hormonal signal. This can be due to a condition called insulin resistance, in which cells literally becomes desensitized to the hormone and it can no longer do its job effectively. Chronically high intake of simple sugars coupled with a sedentary lifestyle can lead to insulin resistance.

Back to the campfire analogy. Let's have a nice hot blaze represent someone who eats a generally well balanced diet of nutritious foods (logs) and does moderate to vigorous physical activity on a daily basis (well stoked fire with lots of dry wood). Throw a newspaper (pre-workout snacks/drinks) on there and it will burn up nicely and leave no trace aside from some flakes of ash. Active muscles absorb the excess glucose in the bloodstream quickly in order to burn it for energy and replenish glycogen stores. Moving your muscles actually activates a different set of glucose transporters on the surface of the cell, which is very similar to the action of insulin. This is why exercise can be effective in helping to manage blood glucose levels in type-2 diabetes.

Now imagine you have a much smaller fire that is essentially just smoldering embers with a few flames - let this represent someone who does essentially no physical activity. Consuming sugar in this state is like throwing a damp newspaper over the embers. The edges will probably dry out and burn, but you're going to be left with a smoking mess as the fire is smothered and the paper burns slowly like incense or a cigarette leaving lots of smoke and char in its wake. Now throw some more wet newspapers before the rest have had a chance to burn through. And again, and again. Pretty soon you have a pile of damp, charred paper sitting on some embers and choking the fire, and it's going to take forever to burn through. You can perhaps see where this is going.

A chronic calorie surplus will normally lead to weight gain, but throw in a ton of sugar at the same time and this process can be enhanced. High insulin levels send a strong signal the body to undergo growth and repair of tissues, but also to store excess energy as fat. If you're not working your muscles, the dominant process will be increased fat storage. Imagine consuming sugary sodas all day and maintaining very high blood glucose and insulin levels. You can probably see how this isn't great for your body unless you're running a marathon.

On top of this, chronically high blood sugar is harmful in itself independent of the effects of insulin. High concentrations of sugar molecules can cause them to literally bind to proteins and fats - changing their structure and function. This can lead to circulatory problems or even blindness.

I've mostly focused my attention on muscle and adipose tissue here, but excess sugars can also have downstream effects on the liver and cause fatty liver disease. There is also research to suggest that glucose and fructose (the two components of regular table sugar, sucrose, and also of high-fructose corn syrup) have different effects on the body, but I'll leave that for others to cover."
nutrition,When refined sugar is metabolized part of it produces a toxic compound as well
nutrition,"In simple terms refined sugars are shorter than glucose (carbon length). That means our bodies utilize them faster (glycolysis). However, our bodies need sugar to function. So, it’s important to get the right amount of more complex sugars in. 

A high sugar diet alone won’t make someone fat. It’s a combination of simple carbs (also sugar), fatty foods, overeating and sugars. Let’s just call this poor lifestyle choices. 

For running, I’d go with energy dense snacks that contain complex carbs and natural sugars. Fruit is a good bet. As are energy bars depending on what’s in them."

nutrition,"If most vegetable oils are bad for us (in excess and/or reheated), so is saturated fat from red meat (again, in excess). Plant-based meat will replace regular meat mainly because the whole meat farming industry is unsustainable and very much detrimental to the environment: the amount of food necessary to feed livestock is unsustainable (millions of deforested acres just to keep some monoculture of soy/wheat/whatever cattle and chicken eat), the amount of water they need it's very huge (1 pound of beef requires about 1800 gallons of water), also livestock produces lots of greenhouse gas emission (methane and CO2), and the waste they produce if not managed properly usually just goes straight to our waters."

nutrition,"So you're right that obviously real, whole food like oats or potatoes is much better for you than pure sugar, because of other components like fiber, etc. 

But the reason pure sugar is so bad in terms of insulin is because it causes such a rapid increase in blood glucose, which in turn, spikes your insulin. The carbs in whole food get broken down much more slowly."

nutrition,"Doesn't matter. Sucrose is sucrose, it doesn't magically become healthier because it's from ""whole food."""
nutrition,"Thanks.

The problem with CICO is that the body doesn't have a ""calorie counter"" function. 

The weight regulation network of the body is run by hormones, and those hormones are affected by a whole host of factors, including what you eat and how metabolically healthy you are. Those hormones affect hunger, the body's base metabolic rate, and the level of activity. 

It is true that if you are losing weight you are in a negative calorie balance and if you are gaining weight you are in a positive calorie balance, but those are the results, not the drivers. The drivers are the hormones."

nutrition,"You're not completely wrong, with real foods having other components, but the reason those are better is because they are composed of complex carbohydrates (like starch or pectin) which is essentially long chains of monosaccharides (like glucose for example). 

When you eat these complex carbs, it takes time for your body to break these into simple sugars. Since insulin is only responsive to glucose and not these longer sugars, insulin levels do not go up as quickly with complex carbs."

nutrition,"&gt;The body’s first choice of creating energy is glucose so by eating sugar someone can give the body access to its first and easiest method of making energy.

In aerobic metabolism, there are parallel pathways - you can either burn glucose through glycolysis followed by pyruvate oxidation or you can burn fat through beta oxidation. Both generate Acetyl CoA, which is handled by the citric acid cycle. 

Either pathway works; the only sense in which glucose is the body's first choice is if you eat enough glucose to elevated your blood glucose and your body tries to burn glucose instead of fat to get rid of it. 

Higher effort exercise does depend mostly on glucose, and the brain and red blood cells both require it, but beyond that we are dual-fuel creatures."

It is easy to get ""too much fuel"" with sugar, especially sugary treats. These contain sugar only and no building blocks. Plus, your body can turn them into fat quickly, meaning it's a fast way to put on weight (all the while not getting much needed building blocks)."

nutrition,"Simple/refined carbs are a really fast way for your body to make energy.  When you cut out sugar (are you doing low carb or just cutting out added sugar itself?) your body has to get used to using more complex fuel which takes longer to make energy available.  Fatigue is probably the #1 symptom for me.  Be sure you're getting enough electrolytes, cutting out sugar changes how your body manages water, and you want to be sure it can still do so effectively.  Often this alleviates the fatigue (and headaches) a bit for me.  Otherwise just push on, it gets better soon."

There has been mixed research, although typically, there is a decrease in performance when in a fasted state.

nutrition,I wouldn’t compare the place as a whole. You’d have to consider the food options at each.
nutrition,Right
nutrition,If you're drinking sugar free you can jump all over the place if it's your poison. I follow a guy named Jordan Syatt who has some interesting takes on drinking sugar-free soda that buck the norm you may find useful. I myself like soda water and don't drink cola but it comes down to personal preference imo.
nutrition,"If there’s anything healthier about their fried chicken and french fries compared to other fast food restaurants, then the benefits are probably negligible.  It’s fast food."
nutrition,The spicy southwest salad is probably the best option
nutrition,Good calories but all of their food is filled with large amounts of MSG
nutrition,"When you are typing these numbers ""10000"" and ""66000"" what measurements are you using???? Mg? IU?"
nutrition,"Absolutely, moderation is important.

So is tolerance on both sides of the equation. I gave up alcohol, excess sugar excess process foods.

For ME, that has the right decision. I don't preach, I believe in live and let live. I feel frustrated when other ppl feel guilty about their choices because they are comparing theirs to mine. I get doubly frustrated when the Comments and futile attempts at Tempting begin.

Like wtf is up with that?"
nutrition,Recently I looked at Chick-fil-A original sandwich and it was 460 calories. Pretty good protein. Had a Wendy’s small bacon cheeseburger 660 calories. As a small person (not skinny but a smaller woman) needing fewer calories in a day it really shocked me
nutrition,"It's fast food. It's just plain unhealthy overall. But if you are gonna eat a chicken sandwich, use the calories on popeyes chicken sandwich. The taste is better than any other chain. Has less calories and sodium than chick fil a too."
nutrition,"You're on Reddit, gotta switch up your memes to Rick and Morty and Narwhals"
nutrition,agree 100%.
nutrition,Even a regular bowl with a bunch of sour cream is better than a fried sandwich paired with french fries. You don't have to suffer to eat healthier.
nutrition,"It’s chicken, breaded and fried. Shouldn’t be much different in terms of healthiness or calories. I’ve actually heard their secret is powdered sugar in the breading, though not 100% sure that’s true. If it is its much less healthy. Grilled will have a less calories/carbs."
nutrition,"Yes, it can be very expensive, so it can attract resentment from some people, and people who are socially conservative can have ideological problems with it."
nutrition,"I think that there are actually vegan cat foods which are made to be good enough on their own, but still I would advise people to do their research."
nutrition,"“Nutritionists hate this man!”

nutrition,"Protein is really a non issue, I can easily get 140 grams of protein in a day without supplementation"
nutrition,Most people don't become vegan for their health but for the animals
nutrition,Okay thanks that seems like some pretty important information but does iron really need to be supplemented? Can't it be given in a green smoothie for example?
nutrition,Yes but almost nobody reaches the level of optimal nutrition
nutrition,"My personal anecdote is backed up by doctors, I always discuss my diet during checkups and I’ve been told that sodium intake is an issue for everyone—mostly for people at risk of high blood pressure. Those factors might be well-documented, but not everyone has high blood pressure issues, and not everyone would benefit from a very low-sodium diet.

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/its-time-to-end-the-war-on-salt/

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/09/salt-not-as-damaging-to-health-as-previously-thought-says-study

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-trouble-with-excess-salt

I do want to focus on the idea of moderation, though, because that is the key to any healthy diet. And it’s why I don’t like to villainize *all* fast food. Restaurant food is often just as bad, if not worse than fast food. I’m a classically trained chef, and we also put “ungodly” amounts of fat, sodium, and sugar in the food. It’s just a way to make it taste good. And I’m not just talking about cheap chain restaurants, fancy restaurants are often the biggest culprits of this. But it doesn’t mean that in order to be healthy you need to avoid restaurants and fast food, you just need to know exactly what you’re eating and be able to balance your daily food intake with it. 

Enjoyment and happiness is a part of health, too. As long as you’re getting a good overall balance of your macro- and micro-nutrients and caloric intake, you’re healthy."
nutrition,"Right, *moderation* is the key word here. And your personal anecdote/eyeball estimate isn’t a terribly reliable piece of data.

We know that high sodium intake isn’t a good thing for your health. The negative effects are pretty well documented. Fast food tends to be loaded with an ungodly amount of fat, sodium, and sugar - these things are not healthy because if they were a regular part of your diet, you’d be more likely to develop issues down the line."
nutrition,"Hypoglycaemia is very difficult to achieve for healthy individuals. When not eating, the body makes new glucose first from stored glycogen and then through gluconeogenesis. Therefore, the blood glucose levels are remained more or less stable. These symptoms come from the increased stress levels that first occur during fasting (and when people say that they feel they have low blood sugar, what they actually have is high levels of catecholamines)."
nutrition,Any difference in taste?
nutrition,I like to scrub those sons of bitches.
nutrition,I agree. I have tried keto and couldn’t keep with it because for me it was too restrictive and I actually gained weight on weight watchers. This time I am simply tracking calories and carbs. I’ve lost 48.6 lbs since June 2020 and have been able include treats or a treat meal so I don’t feel deprived or guilty. This is key for me since I haven’t binged since I started this. Also I’ve been able to go from being diabetic to the prediabetic category even though I still have 100 lbs to go. I do eat healthy 90 % of the time so I can eat less healthier 10% of the time and this is so much healthier than I was eating before.
nutrition,"The sugar in apple juice is not meaningfully different from cane sugar, it's still a liquid dose of fructose. Fruit concentrates are considered a form of added sugar usually and the same ought to apply to apple/pear/orange juice which is used as the main ingredient in most 'healthy juices' and smoothies.

Anyway to try and make it taste good without the sugar, I think ginger and lemon can help, along with a bit of whole fruit which at least contains fibre."
nutrition,"Agreed, which is why I explicitly mentioned I was speaking in terms to the general population and even referenced bodybuilders (upper echelon of body composition) as exceptions."
nutrition,Something about their chicken makes it seem healthier than your typical Popeye’s chicken. Or am I just falling for marketing tactics?
nutrition,But aren't all parents forcing their lifestyle onto their kids? Mine fed me bacon even though I actually loved pigs and would have never eaten them if they told me what I was eating.
nutrition,The biggest difference is cola is usually caffeinated but clear soda like sprite and fruit flavored soda isn't.
nutrition,"I’ve done intermittent fasting for most of 2 years now, only eat in a 6 hour window 2-8pm. I would 100% agree that my body tolerates a lack of sugars better than it used too. No hunger shakes. I’ve actually put on loads of weight in muscle over this time as well. Best gains off my life."
nutrition,Two chicken sandwiches no sauce is about 650 calories and 40-50g protein. Best thing honestly.
nutrition,"Speaking of experiences as well /u/Garryg223 is right. Calorie in vs calorie out is definitely right but i would say that it’s clear and given and for the very beginner in the path of healthiness which a lot of people in this sub are already aware of. On the other hand, food composition is really what is at play here if we want to optimise health which is the point of this sub and speaking from experiences, the quality of your food matters A LOT more than the simple number of calories

One clear example as a bodybuilder is: clean vs dirty bulking. The simple mental and physical (physical is not proven though) effects you get from clean bulk is enough to say that the quality of food you ingest is far more superior to the calorie metric.

Imo"
nutrition,Double meat burrito bowl.  Arguably the best calorie:protein ratio out there for restaurants.
nutrition,"Yea, probably but the benefits are still a bit hyped and not limited to being achieved by just fasting. Many of the supposed benefits can happen but just being metabolically healthy, and not over fat."
nutrition,Exactly
nutrition,"I used to buy the Good and Gather Organic Power Greens mix, containing spinach, kale, mizuna and chard. But because it's organic and free of pesticides, it had bugs in it before the expiration date. The green juice has 28g of sugar, and 0g added sugars. I guess I should now count the sugar in my diet along with calories and protein."
nutrition,"At the end of the day, it’s basically about how much you consume that will determine the “healthiness”"
nutrition,"Salt isn’t an issue for everyone though. For example, I have pretty low blood pressure, and I eat 95% of my meals home cooked, and I add a fuckton of salt and butter. I probably regularly consume 400% of the daily recommended sodium, but I also drink a ton of liquids and it’s never had a negative impact on my health. My blood sugar and cholesterol levels are great. It’s all about moderation. I enjoy some ice cream here and there. I usually put a bit of sugar in my salad drsssings. I make a lot of homemade bread, and in many of them I add sugar as well. It is a perfectly 100% “healthy” diet? Maybe not to some, but I get a very balanced amount of vegetables and protein, and I make room for delicious treats here and there.
My health factors have always been great."
nutrition,Oh god please anybody reading this do not feed your cat vegan cat food. You will slowly kill them or have them develop horrible medical issues. Those VEGAN cat food lines are meant to be served with meat.
nutrition,"Most fast food have some options with protein, yeah. But usually all the items are extremely high in sodium, and some also in sugar and saturated fat. So while it's fine on occasion, it's by no means healthy. You can eat your calories in fast food or chips and baked goods, sure. Maybe you won't gain weight but you sure as hell wouldn't be healthy. Your blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol would be in horrible condition. 1 grilled chicken sandwich from there has 660mg of sodium and 9 grams of sugar. That's a quarter of your days sodium intake in 1 sandwich. It can be eaten on occasion without issues for sure. But fast food is by no means ""healthy"". It's not just calories and protein that matter."
nutrition,The main ingredient in chic fil a sauce is also SOYBEAN oil which is one of the single most inflammatory things you can put in your body.
nutrition,EVERYONE KNOWS THIS.
nutrition,"I think it’s better to rephrase that as many popular fast food items are not as nutrient dense. I would even argue against them all being calorie dense. Some of chick fil-a’s sandwiches are only a few hundred calories and pretty high in protein. And they have a delicious kale salad, which is low in calories and nutrient dense. A kale salad and grilled chicken sandwich is a pretty healthy option in my opinion if you’re not villainizing bread in general"
nutrition,Do you believe that a vegan diet could be optimal with appropriate supplementation?
nutrition,"&gt;And if vitamin D levels are already a problem and vegan diets inherently lead to lower levels, you can draw the conclusion that it’s a problem.

If the solution in both cases is to supplement to achieve optimal nutrition, then I don't agree with the phrasing. The answer to the question then becomes: ""Yes, a vegan diet is nutritionally adequate for all stages of life assuming properly supplementation,"" which would be the same answer for non-vegan diets."
nutrition,Being “fast food” doesn’t make it automatically unhealthy
nutrition,"The only thing that will make you fat is eating over your daily caloric budget. You could literally eat donuts everyday and not get fat as long as you were in an overall balance.

That being said, I feel like their menu is pretty “healthy.” Their grilled chicken options are pretty tasty, low in calories, and high in protein"
nutrition,Vegan babies are breastfed too...
nutrition,"I double checked like 6 times and sadly everytime I looked, its kcal... but what You're saying makes sense so I hope the manufacturers made a mistake on the labelling.. although my country is pretty strict on food safety so I'm not sure if these things happen.

But yeah either they added some ultra weird but somehow legal chemicals that increased the caloric count immensely or they mislabelled it. I'm hoping it's the latter x.o"
nutrition,"Fast food in general isn't super healthy. But one thing Chick-fil-A has impressed me with is their grilled nuggets. A 12 count is only 200 calories and has 38g of protein. The seasoning does have quite a bit of sodium though, so that is something you will have to watch out for. But that is one fast food item that I've found to be much more reasonable than any other I know of."
nutrition,"High cholesterol is “A” potential factor in heart disease but is far from the only factor in heart disease.

And if vitamin D levels are already a problem and vegan diets inherently lead to lower levels, you can draw the conclusion that it’s a problem."
nutrition,"the biggest problem with chipotle is the serving size.  second problem is probably sodium.  or maybe just the sour cream.

if you get a veggie burrito bowl and split it into two meals it's not too bad.  the problem there is it's just really hard to resist finishing it."
nutrition,"It's basically BBQ hollandaise, so I'm not surprised."
nutrition,more specifically... it's fried food and carbs.
nutrition,This human gets it
nutrition,"I get their Spicy Southwest Salad pretty often. High on the sodium side, but I feel like it's in the same category as Chipotle if you want something well-rounded but still fast food. I would be curious to hear if any nutritionists have any opinion on this salad.

nutrition,I haven't died yet.
nutrition,"I think your nutrition course failed you if you're buying added-sugar, fat-free yoghurt. Fat is good now, sugar is bad. The fat in dairy in particular is where a good amount of nutrition is stored and is very interesting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_fat_globule_membrane

Also that juice is full of sugar. Just blend some spinach in if you need the green."
nutrition,"I eat them right of the bush at my house, sometimes with bugs for extra protein and minerals, But I rinse the ones that make it inside."
nutrition,"CFA isn't healthy, all it is compared to something like Jack in the box is higher quality ingredients, consistency and good customer service. The spicy grilled salad is good and low cal but tons of sodium."
nutrition,"If it fits your macros and you're working properly with calories in calories out, it won't make you fat. Make sure you count your sauces.

nutrition,Healthy er
nutrition,"I've been using cara care which is alright. Nice to be able to see symptom trends, but the food tracker isn't ideal."
nutrition,lol i definitely miss them 🥺 but it’s worth it to me to still be able to eat at chick-fil-a often and keep a calorie deficit

nutrition,"1. If 41.6% of the American population, then it's not a vegan nutrition problem, it's a national health problem don't try to pin it to vegans. They should all get tested and supplement if deficient. 

2. Supplementation can get patients to optimal vitamin D levels, read a book or get actual patients. 

3. The article you cited first says that kids not following a vegan diet can got higher cholesterol levels wich,  if you didn't get informed, it can lead to cardiovascular disease, and last time I checked, it's listed as one of the top death reasons in the US. 

4. OP asked if it is adequate. A meat based diet can be a mess if not planned correctly, just as a plant based diet. Also, optimal levels of something vary from person to person, it's multifactorial, so yes, you can achieve optimal levels of everything on a plant based diet at any stage in life

nutrition,I second this. -20 lbs this year and I eat chick fil a 3-5 times a week. My order is 12 grilled nuggets and a spicy chicken deluxe. I never get fries
nutrition,"Newborn babies MUST be exclusively breastfed AT LEAST until 6 months of age, and should be breastfed until the age of 2, with progressive introduction of solid foods only after 6 months of age. After the sixth month, if the food introduction is well planned by a dietitian (watching for B12 and iron mostly), yes, it can (and must for the child's well being) be nutritionally adequate, however, forcing any eating lifestyle to an infant is not a good thing to do because it can cause troubles in the future (remember you chose to be a vegan, the least you can do is to let the child choose it or not as well).

English is my 2nd language so i apologise for bad grammar."
nutrition,"If you're talking about the standard items like fried chicken and fries, they are no different from any other fast food place. ""Healthiness"" is only really possible to determine on an item-by-item basis, all fast food is pretty calorie dense and nutrient poor."
nutrition,I'm not an expert but I think yes. Fasting is not only for weight loosing.
nutrition,Crono is great for vegans who track not only the amount but also the type of protein. But the downside is the lack of iodine and the annoying search for basic nonmarked products.
nutrition,"I was just about to say, I'm 5'2"" and I eat about 2200 on my active days, unless she has a metabolism problem I don't see why she should be eating 1400 or below. She should talk to her General Practitioner about her caloric intake if anyone, and maybe after reviewing that with doc, she can take their suggested number to the coach for further review.  


Also, after a basic look at the Calorie Calculator, for a 5'4"" woman with 18% body fat that is very active (I just guessed because I don't know your sister's measurements or percentage), maintenance calories would be like \~2700/day, and weight loss at 1lb/week would be 2200 and change. She should definitely be eating more, whatever the case is!"
nutrition,"You also literally could not be eating enough protein. That was a huge issue for me, I thought 4-4.5oz was enough but nay! 5.6-6oz/day are in high demand for my tiny, mighty stomach depending on the day and the type of meat it is."
nutrition,Would you take them if they were in a smoothie or a milkshake?
nutrition,"In my experience, supplementing my diet with soluble fiber has been super helpful in curbing hunger pangs, as well as upping my caloric intake. I like to volume eat and I try to stick to anti-inflammatory foodstuffs as much as I can (little to no white sugar, cutting simple carbs where possible, eating more fermented stuff). I'd suggest trying volume eating if you want, it might be good for you!  


Another route might be to up your healthy fat intake at the time you take in your fiber or your high protein meals. Even if it's just pairing the salad in your chicken with a creamy avocado-based dressing instead of a vinaigrette or a light oil, it can make a difference in how satisfying your meal can be. I used to be a stickler for not using creamy dressings, but there's a time and place for them for sure."
nutrition,"Off of this, should I cut, monitor macros, bulk...? What do?"
nutrition,"Howdy guys! Just not sure if I'm doing the most effective eating. I want to build muscle first and lose fat second, but I don't know if my fat composition will change just with building muscle. When I first started my gym journey 2 weeks ago, I was 130lbs. I'm 5'2""; my waist was 30 in, hips were 34 in (I measured wrong, didn't get my butt), elbow was 9 in, and wrist was 6 in. That's calculated at 26% body fat, and I guess I should aim for like 20% composition to tone up?

The trainer I spoke with from the gym I go to said for the days I go to the gym I can probably manage about 2200 cals for the day (or less), and on the days I'm not going I should stay between 1750 and 1900ish, pizza and wings being absolutely fine! Especially on cal dense days.  


Only confusion I'm having now is whether I should plan to watch for any specific ingredients in my food to stop the swelling/water retention I get sometimes, because that's probably the worst-offending thing for me, and the thing that makes me most uncomfortable with my body. I'll eat something sweet or salty and then suddenly I can see my love handles again or my stomach will balloon. I've been taking fiber with my protein shake in the morning as well as a probiotic supplement to try and mitigate bloat, but how do I get my inflammation to go down?"
nutrition,Soylent is marketed as a meal replacement.
nutrition,"Honey is added sugar. If you are dead-set on cutting out **100%** added sugar, then that includes honey. But really, adding a teaspoon of honey to your tea isn't going to kill you. The problem with added sugar in *processed foods* is that it's in *everything*, even stuff you wouldn't expect, like soup. 

If you're having mostly whole foods with little added sugar, having some honey in moderation is fine."
nutrition,I'll read more about this and have a better understanding. Thanks
nutrition,"Hypervitaminosis A is a toxic excess of vitamin A. It is most commonly caused by eating bear liver, which is extremely high in Vitamin A. Lots of people, in the Arctic especially, have died from it!"

Funny how you are all standing up for someone when I just asked them to explain the use of it in this context and just said that they probably didn't know what it meant. How is typing two words wrongly a typo? How is being sick of it being used in the wrong context again another reason to bother me about it? Almost makes me want to ask you to explain the use of the word typo and assume you don't know what it means. 

How about we just stop this conversation about what you think OP has said and what you think it was. I either need to hear this straight from the horse's mouth or we just let it go, because you keep talking to me instead of asking OP about this.

nutrition,"Unfortunately, when I eat those ""Non-clean"" foods it shows on my face as perioral dermatitis. Like almost instantly so yes, it IS making me sick. Do I still consume sometimes?

So I switched to an anti inflammatory diet. I’ve been on it for 2 months and I’m averaging 1600-1700 calories a day and I constantly feel hungry and tired. I’m drinking lots of water, I’ve cut out dairy/carbs/sugar/caffeine/alcohol. I make sure I have a good mix of veggies and fruit, animal and plant carbs, healthy fats and fibre.

nutrition,"I really need help with this, is it just a scam and/or is it nerutoxic?

I have 2 different turmeric powders, one ""normal"" (from Superfruit) and one that claims to keep the ""essential oils"" during extraction (from Rawpowder).     
*Both are Swedish brands.*  

The powders look very similar and I don't notice any difference when mixing each one in water (no oil streaks etc but I did this a long time ago so I could try again).

&amp;nbsp;

Rawpowder (the one with oils) also claims to have a higher ratio of curcumin compared to other brands, and when comparing the nutritional facts on the back it claims to contain 9,9 grams of fat (the oils) but also 3,2 grams of sugar??? (compared to normal turmeric with 1,7 grams of fat and 0 grams sugar (per 100 grams)).     

Rawpowders nutrition facts also adds up to a total of 104 grams?? Wtf?        
Maybe it still makes sense as a fiber or protein can also be a fat or carb?   
Idk, just pointing it out...      
Keep in mind that there needs to be room for all the minerals and other contents of turmeric, so Superfruits which adds up to 86,4 grams makes way more sense.

Superfruits also supposedly contains 3 grams more fibers 🤷‍♂️

&amp;nbsp;

I am unable to find ANY other brand that offers a turmeric powder with oils in it...    
Note that they claim the oils have not been added, but kept by using a different extraction method than usual (can't find any info on how).      
Rawpowder is also cheaper than most alternatives, even tho it supposedly is better/healthier.

(Turmeric oils are supposed to offer health benefits as well that turmeric powders miss out on, I have no clue if this has been scientifically researched but that's their reason for including it).

Since it's Swedish, and a pretty old company, I have a hard time imagining some scam/blatant lies being made (due to EU having stricter consumer laws), but the health industry is very shady and full of scams so who knows...

I'm concerned because a lot of products like these that comes from poor countries and offer miraculous health benefits, can contain heavy metals and neurotoxic substances.    
Could the one with oils in it be dangerous to consume?      
If it's not a scam, does it really offer any extra health benefits?

Rawpowder doesn't explain well at all how the process is made and there is very little to no info at all.      
Their website is also poorly designed.

I am considering emailing them if no one here solves this.

When I say greens I mean: Spinach, Collards, Arugula, Broccoli, Broccolini, Broccoli Rabe, Kale, Brussel Sprouts, Asparagus, etc.  They have a lot of nutrients both vitamins and phytonutrients good for the skin."
nutrition,"Ok but I take it as an overcorretion. Come here from being unhealthy. So you need to learn new habits and information, so you go a little overboard. Once ou have the basics down then you can find that balance."

nutrition,"So I just checked the nutritional value of this chicken steak and I'm just shocked that it has over 800kcals per serving of 80g.

It contains roughly 10g of protein, 12.5g of carbs and 11g of fats and 462.4mg of sodium. Can anyone tell me how this is even remotely possible? Thanks! I'd post a picture of the product but I dont think its allowed here.

The chicken looks normal by the way, it's just a chicken cutlet with quite abit of skin in it."
nutrition,Please reply if you get an answer
nutrition,i don’t think anyone is making a joke about it here.  maybe you misread OP’s comment.
nutrition,i’m not sure because i was recently time that a green tea only intermittent fasting diet was the way to go.
nutrition,So what do you eat?
nutrition,"Good post.

Food is a part of culture and should be enjoyed. Modern western diets and fast food are bad not just because it's full of sugar and degraded oils, but because of the fast life that goes with it.

Nutrition has a moderate role in health and it's important to maintain perspective, it might be worth redistributing some effort to other things like exercise, stress, sleep and sunshine.

There are a plenty of examples of cultures that commit various dietary sins (eating tons of salt, drinking wine etc) but still seem generally healthy and it might genuinely be due to the way they eat, the social element. Trying to be 100% pure by eating your hyperrestrictive diet on your own may be entirely missing the point of life."
nutrition,Wrong that we get pleasure from fatty foods? I thought that was the reason that higher fat foods feel more satisfying/satiating.
nutrition,Don't eat it everyday. Don't underestimate how well your body will maintain homeostasis.
nutrition,I think you should stick to the anti-vegan sub and other pseudo nutrition subs.
nutrition,"Thank you for this post. Nobody is going to be perfect when it comes to nutrition because we're human. All that matters is being conscious and educated, not restricting yourself so hard that you get mad at every little thing that others do that doesnt align with the perfection you're trying and failing to achieve."

nutrition,Yep good luck :)
nutrition,"Yes I agree, unfortunately calorie tracking is what got me into a mess in the first place and I’ve tried so many things to try and get out! I do tend to eat a lot of fibre and protein anyways, so I’m sure I’ll be able to work out a plan to suit myself better. Thanks so so much again, this is super helpful :)"
nutrition,"Is she getting ready to compete? To get into competition condition, you need unhealthily low levels of body fat. Pretty much every body builder feels like absolutely shit a month or so before their shows due to the severe lack of food they need to maintain to look “shredded”."
nutrition,"I'm actually not familiar with the wider intuitive eating topic. I just think that people can be too obsessed with calorie tracking, and that it's possible to stay lean while eating to satiation by:

* minimising sugar and general snack food (and beer)

* eating plenty of protein and fibre (i.e. wholesome meals)

Personally I enjoyed following a low carb high fat diet, I feel like changing to a fat-based metabolism helped change my appetite signals. But the above rules should work for any other healthy diet."
nutrition,Yeah I eat a lot of tofu and high protein yoghurts so I’ll be happy haha. Any advice on intuitive eating if you don’t mind?
nutrition,Ok cool. Yeah you can probably make do with veg protein if you eat enough. I'm a fan of tempeh actually.
nutrition,"Okay, I’ll try my best. Thanks again! I am vegetarian but I know lots of good high protein veg friendly food. I’ll make sure to eat when I’m hungry, I’m quite out of practice with intuitive eating ! So that’s something else I’ll have to work on as well"
nutrition,"Yep that's what I'd do. I don't how long it would take for your calorie intake to increase but exercise will make you hungry and you should eat enough to help build muscle, otherwise you'll just make things worse. The long term goal is to not count anything, and be able to eat until you're full and have the calories take care of themselves.

For general health I'd recommend eating a diverse range of proteins: meat, nuts, powders, etc. Unprocessed red meat isn't unhealthy. Collagen proteins are good too and should help build lean mass.


In regards to carbs, it's probably the large doses of added sugar that are the worst. White bread isn't great either. If you want to eat whole grains and legumes I wouldn't stop you."

&gt;Summary: how much calcium is in sardines/herring bones?

Perhaps you could do some math, and subtract the calcium in a fish fillet from the calcium in sardines to figure out the total calcium in the sardines, which is mostly due to bones

&gt;Do you have other suggestions of bones that I can eat as a daily source of calcium?

You could make bone broth from chicken/beef. The calcium never gets absorbed into the water even with lots of acid, it stays in the bone. But the bones are soft and you can eat them afterwards. And the collagen is pretty great for you too.

There are also anecdotes of some indigenous societies eating ground up seashells for calcium"
nutrition,"Yes regulations might be different, leading to different calorie count. Or maybe they excluded the fibre calories"
nutrition,"Sourdough is probably healthier than normal white bread. 1 slice a day is fine, could even have 2. Most people in the world eat a lot worse things than that."
nutrition,"At the point where people use alcohol to dampen their inhibitions in social circumstances, I've had the thought that some of the benefits research finds for \*moderate\* drinking on cardiovascular/some other health measures may be an indirect result of it enabling people to strengthen their social circles. which, the social utility of alcohol isn't trivial as you can even find literature talking about it's role in the development of civilization.

Whiskey might have an advantage over other alcoholic drinks if the amount of alcohol consumed is the same due to it being relatively low calorie (mixed drinks being excluded). But I read something at one point about how the barrel aging process that gives it a brown color likely also creates carcinogenic compounds so it's probably more hazardous to health than most clear liquors like vodka."
nutrition,"Protein and exercise.

Now that my wife has joined me and is still new I like to keep the meals varied for her sake and my meal preps coincide with my dinner prep these days. I make dinner meals that feed the entire family (5) for two days. There will be leftovers from things like making rice and or a batch of whatever veggies I make. So for the most part I cook the protein we will have for lunch that week on Sunday and container it. In the evening before dishes each night I will get the protein container out and put the protein, any leftover veggies, and generally rice into a container for the following day. We eat alot of rice in our house so that will generally be a carb for us. We adjust regularly by adding fruit to the mix if not enough veggies or rice."

And on Cronometer, all the raw food is from database information rather than random user input. And even packaged stuff is verified by the Cronometer team. So it's much more reliable.

I asked my doctor about it and she said to get one without zinc - that for some people, your body thinks you've ingested something toxic and will just chuck it back up in self defense. So I did, and yeah, I can take pretty much any brand without zinc. Whatever zinc I get from my diet is gonna have to be good enough haha."

nutrition,"\&amp;gt; Isn't food high in fats and high in sugar...actually better for you compared to food low in fats but high in sugar?

Not generally true. Cant generalize that way.

Unprocessed foods tend to be healthier. In your example of whole dairy milk, the whole milk is less processed. I find that's a better mindset than thinking the whole milk is healthier due to the cream. Cream is not healthy. The whole milk is healthier than the cream.

A cup of oil + a cup of sugar is worse than just a cup of sugar.

Unprocessed foods are best. Eat whole, unadulterated foods. An avocado is almost all fat, an orange is almost all sugar, both are healthy. Orange juice and avocado oil are not. Avoid processed foods."
