keto,Can stress kick you out of keto? Cortisol question,"So I've been losing a steady 4 lbs a week for the past few weeks, still a lot left to lose, but the last week I only lost 1lb with no change to my diet compared to the 4lb loss weeks.

The only thing that's been different is that I've been extremely stressed at work, I'm still eating my normal meals I always eat but the stress is the only thing different. Then I read that stress can increase cortisol levels which may interfere with ketone production/use, does anyone have experience with this happening to them? Is there any science to back it or just bologna?

Not sure what to do to get back to ketosis. I've been measuring .5 and lower consistently for the past week"
keto,down almost 20 lbs before and after pics (slightly nsfw).... feeling so inspired and motivated THANK YOU KETO,"I'm 23, and 5'6. I was someone who struggled with disordered eating for years and years and due to covid I spiraled into binge eating and ballooned up from 120 to 180!!! I GAINED 60 FREAKING LBS IN 6 MONTHS. I was so shocked and sad and upset with myself. I tried everything under the sun (vegan, heavy lifting, intermittent fasting) which all failed. I had never been so big in my life. I was feeling lethargic, ugly, insecure, unhealthy, lazy, etc. I had always been thin up to that point, so to be on that end of things was just eye opening in a way that made me realize how important my health is and that I needed to make a serious change. I reached out for help and found a program that is centralized around low carb lifestyle. I thought, hey that's one that I actually haven't tried yet! and ive been on the program consistently exercising and weighing my food and at my appointment on Thursday I weighed in at 162. I could have cried really! this really really works and and im so proud of myself. Its amazing to see other aspects of my life change when I start putting myself first too. I'm in the process of getting a new amazing job and I've broken out of my alcoholic tendencies, this is just the beginning for me! I still have a long ways to go but my goal weight of 130 seems not so daunting now : )

keto,Pulsatile tinnitus and Keto,"I have been doing Keto for around 10 weeks, have lost ~ 6.5 kgs during that time. In the past few weeks I have experienced pulsatile tinnitus which I have never had previously. Has anyone else experienced this? Did you find anything that got rid of it?"
keto,Does Keto Work? (Emphatic Yes),"Preface - Over 50 Soldier here. (Male)

Deployed to Afghanistan from 2019-2020. Weighed in February 2020 at 236. Got told by a Bosnian soldier (Female) ""You need to get fit"".

Started Keto that evening, ate a ton of Chicken, Eggs, and Bacon. Cut out: Cookies, Ice Cream, Monster Energy (Except the low-carb, 0 cal ones)

Exercise: Would routinely road march 5-9 miles every other day. Started swimming after redeployment to Qatar. 

Lowest weight was 199. In June 2019. So yes, 37 pounds in four months. 

Some Observations:

1) Lack of Carbs make you VERY ""cranky"". I was around 50g of Carbs a day, some days less.

2) You need Vitamin supplements and monitor what you eat. I had two incidents in Qatar where on my walk to work, my legs stopped functioning. As in they wouldn't go forward. Did a calorie check and realized I had subsisted on around 1250 cals a day for two weeks.  

3) I had ZERO cheat days for around 3 months. (See 1. I was not pleasant). 

4) While I can lose weight quick, I can gain weight FAST.

keto,Homemade meal replacement type shake recipe thing,"I really struggle to get enough calories in on keto - I usually top out at about 1000, but honestly since I’m not hungry I leave it alone. 

However, I recently ended up sick, and now allergy season is hitting me hard. Everything tastes bland to me. Off keto, my only consumption would be Sunny D at this point. Obviously not an option at this here, but I’m barely coasting 500 calories at this point. That’s a problem, especially because the less I eat the less I feel like making food...

So! Any meal replacement powder / shake / whatever that can be thrown into some sort of “fun” milkshake / smoothie / drink recipe would be appreciated for sick days. Or lazy days. Lazy sick days. 

Thank you!"
keto,Zero sugar energy drinks on keto,"Just wondering what people's thoughts are on energy drinks on keto? I realise they're not great for you, so I do try and keep it to maybe like once or twice a week but they definitely help me out sometimes. I know that some people say the sugar alcohols can cause cravings, I haven't noticed anything like that before. Drinks I typically drink are V sugar free and monster energy ultra (does have some carbs but it fits inside my macros generally)."
keto,"2 months on keto, now I get bad stomach pain when eating carbs","So I have been on a reasonably strict keto diet for a good two months now and tolerated it really well, basically had no issues whatsoever. Before going keto, I didn't have any intestinal problems either though, I just did it out of curiosity and to lose some weight (which also worked great). I don’t want to go back to eating carbs as regularly as I did before this experiment,but I definitely do want to integrate them into my diet again to some degree. However, the teo times that I have now eaten a meal rich in carbs (lentils and chickpeas, both of which I tolerated without issue before), I got some pretty intense and unpleasant stomach cramps that started about 1-2 hours after the carb-rich meals and lasted for several hours. Any ideas as to what might be causing this and how I might rectify this problem would be greatly appreciated!"
keto,Is Keto dangerous for Dialysis?,"Are the diuretic effects of keto dangerous for a dialysis patient? I'm a 4  years in on keto, one and a half of those being zerocarb, so I'm well aware of the need for increased electrolytes. I just have a really bad feeling about mixing keto and dialysis. The internet articles I have read suggest keto would be a bad idea. I generally agree. Anyone on here think otherwise?

I'm looking to make a diet for my type 2 diabetic father on dialysis. Meal planning is pretty difficult because of the decreased phosphorous, potassium, and sodium allowed.

Thanks in advance."
keto,New Custom keto diet I have been working with is showing great results!,"Hi everyone, I came here today to show you a little bit of the comments and results that people have posted about a new customizable ketogenic diet that I have been working with.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Charlotte B \*\*\*\*\* l:

Love the fact that by losing weight, you can adjust your food preferences and eat new meals the following month. This setup helps to keep you accountable and on track to lose weight.

The only part I would like them to have is a macro section to help you add foods that go with it, instead of just the calorie intake range. It's still a good meal plan. So far, in two months, I have managed to lose more than 30 kilos with him.

&amp;#x200B;

Luna Ma \*\*\*\* e:

Great diet plan !!! I managed to lose 2 kg in 2 weeks, which has never happened to me before with anything else I tried. I followed the diet loosely, still allowing myself treatment once a week. I am at normal weight, but I still feel that I need to lose another 5 kg. Therefore, I will continue to use it. I am very happy with your diet plan !!! Thank you, Keto Custom Plan!

&amp;#x200B;

Michelle M \*\*\*\* r:

I lost 13 pounds eating good food, I am never hungry or dissatisfied. I can't believe it, but the scale doesn't lie !!!!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Mel T \*\*\*\*\* a:

I've already lost almost two kilos just by eating the meals on the plan you provided and exercising several days a week. I'm enjoying making new dishes every night.

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah T \*\*\* d:

Great plan. Easy to follow and tasty recipes. Exercises are really easy and take no time at all. Great value for money.

keto,What Truly is the Best Keto Coffee Creamer?,"Hello all!

I’m on a coffee creamer hunt! Everything that I’ve tried  either tastes amazing, but has horrible inflammatory ingredients OR has amazing ingredients, but taste like cardboard! I’ve spent hundreds trying out new products and it’s making my pockets hurt. Not to mention how wasteful it is :(

I’m looking for a liquid creamer with “clean” ingredients, but that tastes great! Thanks! :)"
keto,Am I eating too much fat?,"I used the recommended keto calculator and the macros that were given to me were: 81 g protein, 29 g of carbs, 171g of fat, 1976 of total kcal. I am 5'3"" @ 313 pounds. 

Isn't that too much fat? Or am I just over-worrying?"
keto,I am telling you - this diet WORKS!! Before/after pics!,"Hey y'all. I am getting married later this summer after having to postpone from last summer. I bought my wedding dress at my skinniest (148 lbs) in summer 2019, then slowly gained 30 lbs back during covid lockdown. I have a $2,000 wedding dress sitting in my closet that needs to fit me! As someone who normally shops at thrift stores, this wedding dress splurge (thanks to my generous parents), is a REALLY big deal. I've never owned anything so expensive and beautiful. I hardcore cracked down on my diet starting January 4, 2021 weighing in at 178.8 and standing 5'5"". 

I've been doing 18:6 intermittent fasting every day during the week and strict keto. Also doing lots of cardio (although I've always exercised at least 4x/week even while chubbier). No cheating whatsoever. Black coffee only in the morning and my eating window doesn't start until at least noon. I'm down 26 lbs in less than 4 months and only about 5-6 lbs away from where I was when I bought my wedding dress! I am going for gold though, and going to lose another 10 lbs on top of that! My goal is to weigh no more than 140 on my wedding day, and with this amazing and wonderful diet full of rich, delicious foods, it is going to be entirely possible! 

Here are my progress pics:

keto,Help with Carb manager,"I adjusted my macros. Will the program still work if I'm ...

45% fat
12% carb
43% protien

That gives me 50g carb per day. 

I'm just unsure if when you adjust it,  it won't work as well?? I only adjusted it because it had me at like 19 carbs a day there's no way I could do that just starting out."
keto,Could sugar alternatives be causing my skin breakouts/Acne?,"I'm 51F and have never had a problem with skin breakouts and acne.  I started keto two years ago, but this last year especially I've been eating too much of sugar substitutes, all kinds, and my skin has been terrible.  After doing some research I'm just now realizing it MAY be the sugar substitutes, so I'm taking a break for a couple of weeks to see if my skin clears up.  Gonna be very hard, but if it does clear up, then I will introduce Stevia because it's 100% natural and go from there.   Not positive it's related, it could very well be hormonal because I should be nearing menopause sometime soon, but I need to find out.  I will miss those Atkins peanutbutter cups tho... and High Key cookies.... I could go on and on..."
keto,Hey r/keto what do you get when ordering food from a non-chain restaurant?,"On keto right now and want to treat myself to a meal from a restaurant once a week. With the pandemic and smaller restaurants having a difficult time staying open, hoping to order from local shops to give them some support. 

So r/keto what do you get when ordering food from a non-chain restaurant? 

Ex. I try to get a burrito bowl from a local taqueria rather than going to a Chipotle."
keto,Question: Getting enough protein with a gastric sleeve.,"I am new to keto, but have been reading and lurking for a couple years.  The part I still need an answer to is my protein intake.  

History:  I used to weigh almost 300 lbs, got a gastric sleeve procedure 5 yrs ago, lost 120 lbs.  Since pandemic and depression, I’m back up to 220 lbs, but still with the restriction of portion control from my gastric sleeve.  I have since become anemic and have been told to ingest more iron (I don’t eat enough protein even though I’m literally eating protein all the time, but iron shots may be the way for my body, regardless the struggle is real with ingesting protein due to portion sizes).  

I am 5’9” and 220 lbs and would like to lose to 180 again firstly, then build lean muscle.  However, I calculate my macros for 1200 calories with only allowing 20g carbs (for the beginning) and more protein % than fat, and I’m left with 140g of protein to ingest.  I have a hard time getting to 70g of protein!

This is left me wondering if I need to ingest more protein (which due to the iron deficiency, I would say yes) or just lower the calories to where my protein is at a more attainable goal (80 or 90 g) without jacking the fat up all the way.

Has anyone else had gastric sleeve and done keto?  I definitely cannot be the only one with this issue, and am welcome to suggestions, please."
keto,Sodium/Pins and needles feeling,"Hey all,

13 days into keto (flair update soon when I weight again) and IF, and I feel absolutely fantastic aside from this pins and needles feeling I keep getting in my hands. I read that this is most likely a result of low sodium dropping my blood pressure (it was not high before keto) and can be exacerbated if sodium is low and potassium is high (getting plenty of potassium with my supplements, so it makes sense). Aside from putting salt in my water, which I'm starting to do but don't like, and salting the shit out of my food (I only have two small meals a day...), is there another way I can supplement my sodium intake? After I did my hourly pushups just now I even got that pins and needles feeling in my nose... need to get a lot more sodium asap"
keto,Increased menstrual cycle?,"Hello everyone. I've tried keto a number of times, and every time I do, my period cycle changes from once a month to twice a month. I've tried keto 4 times and this always happens, despite different external factors, and when I stopped keto each time it went away, so I'm pretty sure this is a direct result of keto. The problem is that online I've found no documentation of this side effect and it often says that keto will slow down or stop a person's menstrual cycle. Have any other women experienced this side effect? I'd be interested in reaching out to researchers regarding this side effect but I'd like to know beforehand if anyone else has experienced this!"
keto,How many net carbs can I have if I'm doing this for mental/physical health and not for weight loss?,"It seems like most of the people here are doing this for weight loss. My aims are more for mental and physical health.

I tried to go straight into carnivore and it was a huge failure. My mood ranked, I got dangerously constipated ... Actually thought I might end up in the ER (I can't post this on their subs, which really scares me because I realized they're so heavily gatekept that one can not really have any idea of the potential dangers or pitfalls of carnivore).

So i'm backing up into Keto or ""'ketovore"" ... It's very clear to me that my body wants minimal carbs and high fat, but how many carbs would still keep me in a light state of keto"
keto,Don't do it!,"After nearly a year of Keto - not having a grain of sugar during that time, we went out for a steak dinner last night.  Had a big old filet, Brussel sprouts, one glass of wine but regretfully had a piece of cheesecake (since I'm on maintenance felt like it would be okay).  I immediately felt ill with bloating and that feeling of being over full....this morning feeling bloated with a small headache.  Could it be from the cheesecake?  Learned my lesson and no more sugar!"
keto,"Eating dinner at parents, have a question about 2 dishes","I started my keto diet a week ago, and am managing to stay on my macros pretty well for now. I am eating dinner at my parents tonight and there are two dishes I was wondering if I can eat:

The first is chicken soup. It has powdered stock, vegetables and chicken. I am planning to just have the soup with chicken and no vegetables. Is that fine?

The second is lamb stew, it has vegetables that I would eat a bit of, and lamb which is obviously fine, but the problem with it is that  it has potatoes inside it. Now I could leave the potatoes out and just have the lamb by itself, question is does the potato starch ""leak"" out of the potatoes onto the lamb and make it so I cannot have it.

Really appreciate all answers, sorry if these are obvious questions, as I have said I am pretty new to this diet."
keto,Low calories restriction - can barely lose the weight,"M/35/SW:212/CW:206.   Been doing Keto since Feb. 5th. I've done it before 5 years ago with great results. Like 20 pounds in a month or so. This time around I'm really trying hard. Gym 5 days/week, plus many days I'll walk 3 miles.  I'm really restricting my calories to under 1000, with keto coffee for breakfast, nothing for lunch OR maybe a small snack and a large chicken salad for supper. The problem is I'm barely losing weight, down to 206 from 212.  With such an intense calorie restriction plus exercise and low carb/keto diet I figured I'd be shedding pounds like crazy.    
A buddy of mine who does professional men's physique, and seems to know his stuff when it comes to nutrition says that my metabolism is basically non-existent. He says that I should be eating 3 meals a day and incorporated chicken, beef, sweet potato's, white rice, eggs, oats.   
 My question is, does anyone have similar experiences where they're really restricting diets plus eating low carb plus exercising but the weight doesn't seem to come off well?  More importantly, is it normal to not lose much weight because your metabolism is at a standstill, most likely due to getting older?  Should I be eating 3 meals a day and increasing my daily calorie intake from under 1000 to around 2500?"
keto,Never thought I'd get here,"I've been lurking on this sub for about a year now and thought I would share my own progress.

When we had our first big lockdown from covid, I decided that I was going to take that time to take care of myself. I had always been big. I was the fat one and had tried every way under the sun to lose the weight, but it never really worked.

My wife had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and needed to get her carbs under control. In solidarity, I thought I could start doing keto. I wanted to take care of myself and this seemed to be a way to do it.

It's now been a year and I've lost around 33kg. I have a bit more to go, but for the first time, I actually am starting to feel good about myself. Coming to this sub almost daily and seeing other's stories has been a huge motivation to me, so thank you everyone.

keto,How I Started My Keto...,
keto,hardly any weight loss,I started keto like 4 weeks and I've only lost about 4 to 5 lbs and my weight teeters. I dont know what im.doing wrong. I only eat vegetables meats and other keto. I have not eaten anything processed and the only sweet thing I'll have is a scoop of natural peanut butter  I woej out 4 to 5 times a week to. I don't feel like my meals are very big and I don't snack. Does anyone have any suggestions I should try. should I try fasting? I'm a diabetic and I didn't if that would affect anything. but my blood glucose has gone down significantly. Any tips or advice would be great
keto,Pregnant on Keto,"First time being pregnant on keto (my other two were before I did keto) and I’m just feeling like it’s impossible. I feel more nauseous when I eat keto meals. Has anyone else experienced this? Hoping to get back to more low carb in second trimester when I don’t feel as sick. Right now if oatmeal and cereal keep me from feeling sick, I’m ok with it. Just wondering if I’m not the only one! Thinking maybe the high fat foods just aren’t going to pair well with nausea."
keto,Meal pro tip: check pizza parlors for grilled chicken salads,"I posted a photo of my ridiculous grilled chicken salad I got from East of Chicago for my work lunch recently in one of the keto food subs(r/ketomealseatingnow), and so many people seemed surprised of my lunchtime hack, I figured I should let the masses know here of my favorite cheap and protein heavy meal option.

Background: My work plaza is tiny, y'all. There's an East of Chicago and a Chinese place and that's pretty much it. But work throws money at us each year for team building and we use it for lunches, so if we don't want to blow half of lunch driving somewhere, pizza is our only good option as the Chinese place is... ehh. 

East of Chicago has an amazing marinated grilled chicken salad for $7. Dressing is $0.75, and you can get up to 4x chicken for only $2.25, bringing it to a huge chicken salad for $10 that's so heavy, I swear I thought my boss pranked me with a calzone. Their chicken wings are decent too, so I got garlic since work was paying.

Oh, you can also add any other pizza toppings they have available, but I'm sure that's extra.. It comes with mozzarella, green pepper, and a few slices of tomato."
keto,Protein in the morning?,"Hey folks!

First post here so apologies if it's a repeat. I've been doing keto on and off for 3 years and know the wonders that it provides, which for me was at first focused on weight loss. However, I have sciatica from a herniated disc about 18 months ago and now do keto for weight loss as well as the anti-inflammatory benefits that seem to work. 

Typically most weekdays I also incorporate some type of intermittent fasting where I only have coffee with MCT (BP brain octane oil) and no-sugar creamer, as well as water, until the afternoon. 

In doing some research, collagen protein shows to help heal herniated discs, and I would do anything to beat this back monster. I recently bought some collagen protein powder from Vital Proteins (70 cal, 2.5g fat, 2 g carbs, 0 sugar, 11g protein).

My question -&gt; will putting a scoop of that in my coffee each morning potentially ruin my fast and/or ketosis? As most I would expect, once I break my fast, I'm much more prone to eating throughout the day.

Anywho, sorry for the long post, and appreciate any advice ya'll have!"

keto,"Been working on being Keto 4 weeks, now under 50g Carbs, Question about diet.","I'm trying to do both keto(due to carb sensitivity  before keto) and intermittent fasting (to speed weight loss and autophagy). If I'm not fasting,  I tend towards 1500 cals and two meals in a day with a high fat snack (chocolate and 2 tbsp butter). But when I fast, I can't seem to go below 2000 calories (one meal with lots of fat and a fatty snack before bed, plus extra protein)
I do keep track of my macros: 
Fasting break:
60-80g protein 
40-50g carbs
150ish fat
Non fasting is about the same, but lower calories total.
I wanted to know if other people lost weight, felt good, and were able to maintain their diet on a similar regime. I noticed my weak knees grew stronger and I have more muscle in my arms. I also wondered if the extra 500 calories (mostly from fat) are really necessary. Btw, I came to these macros by listening to my body's needs and feeding cravings with more fat and protein or minerals. 
I can't seem to get to the recommended 25g of carbs! Any suggestions?"
keto,Keto Thirst and Electrolytes,"Hey Everyone!

I'm in my 2nd week of Keto and my thirst levels are insane! I'm loving drinking my water and read about doing Salt Water Sole or just adding a small dose of salt to my water. 

I don't like drinking salty water so does anyone have any recommendations for electrolyte supplements, I've seen a number advertised on amazon and wonder what is best. 

I take a number of vitamin supplements with my lunch and would find it easier to add another tablet to keep my electrolyte levels up. 

Thanks!"
keto,PSA: Halo Top Keto Ice Cream Bars are bullshit!,"Since last Friday, I've been experimenting with allulose to keep my blood glucose down. To finish a meal, I've been having strawberries with cream and allulose or a Quest protein bar with cup of tea sweetened with allulose. My 2-hour postprandial BG readings have been stellar--110 mg/dL or lower.

However, after lunch this past Sunday, my BG shot up to 137 mg/dL. On that particular meal, I had a Halo Top Keto Ice Cream bar in addition to some strawberries and allulose. Since the ice cream bar has only 2g net carbs, I just assumed that it might have been the extra keto bread I ate (4 slices instead of the usual 2), or maybe it was just a fluke. The keto bread I eat is supposed be to zero net carbs and I've never had a problem just eating a couple slices, but some people have reported BG spikes eating this bread. So, this FUD is always in the back of my mind--maybe I'm just getting away with eating the questionable ""resistant"" tapioca starch that the bread is made of because I'm just able to tolerate 2 slices at a time. Who knows?

After that high reading, I started having great BG readings again when eating a Quest bar with tea and allulose to finish a meal. Fast forward to dinner tonight. I decide to try the Halo Top again along with tea and allulose.  My reading this time is 138 mg/dL--almost exactly the same as Sunday! Now I know the reading on Sunday wasn't a fluke.

I decide to check the ingredient list on the Halo Top box again. I see the erythritol, but I know that doesn't cause me issues. I look closer, and I see the problem--god damn maltitol!

I've tried Halo Top ice cream in the carton before, and it was fine, so I guess I didn't look as carefully when I picked up the ice cream bars. Granted, a postprandial reading of 138 mg/dL isn't too bad, but I can only imagine how high it might have been without the help of the allulose.

So the cautionary tale is that just because you had good luck with keto product by some company, it doesn't mean you're going to have good luck with all keto products by that same company."
keto,i dont struggle with hunger or losing weight when im not on keto. should i be doing keto just to get rid of water retention?,"Ok so im doing keto right now for one reason. I have heard that keto makes you look a lot leaner because carbs hold on to excess water.

&amp;#x200B;

i dont struggle with losing weight without keto (for example i can consume 400g of carbs a day and still maintain a low calories diet) i dont struggle with feeling hungry or binging at all. Im mainly conrened about the water retention that is caused by carbohydrates. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should i cut out carbs to look leaner and if no, then is it ok to consume over 300g of carbs everyday while on a cut?

&amp;#x200B;

i get about 200g of protein every day and less than 20g of carbs and the rest of the macros i don't count. my calories are 2000 a day and i workout everyday for 2 hours and do omad everyday (doing omad not for any benefits, but just because i like eating one big meal after my workout and never eat again)"
keto,Will donating plasma drop ketone levels and kick me out of ketosis?,I’m thinking about donating plasma. I don’t know if anyone here has their ketone levels dropped and/or kicked out of ketosis. Hopefully I can get some answers. I’d really appreciate it. I’m a 29 yr old male 6’2 215lbs. I’ll be following the MCT keto diet.
keto,I made keto ice cream,"A quart of Heavy cream, vanilla extract, six egg yolks, half cup of monk fruit crystals.

It’s churning right now.

Why is this not a thing???  How is it that in a major city I can’t go to an ice cream shop that has a keto ice cream.  And don’t get me started on the ones at stores.  They’re okay but full of all this bullshit.  Just make me old fashioned ice cream but swap out the sugar with monk fruit!"
keto,Shill me your best evidence for Keto benefits from within the last 5 years,"I did strict keto in 2014 for a year and it was great. Stopped due to getting sick of eating so much fat, as well as situational factors. Now I want to try again but have been away from the scene for 5 years, so tell me: what's changed? And what new evidence is there to support the notion of a keto diet?

I want to be well armed for all the ""why are you doing that?"" questions I'm going to get

Much love ♥️"
keto,melatonin tablets? carbohydrate gum??,"I took 2 melatonin tablets earlier, didn't consider the ingredients because well, they are not a meal lol. It says they include “carbohydrate gum”, am I in trouble?

keto,Chipotle keto bowl vs keto salad bowl,"So when i go to see chipotle’s lifestyle bowls, it shows “keto bowl” and not “keto salad bowl” but when it comes to ordering its shows both. The website says “keto bowl” has 20g carbs but doesn’t say the net carbs. Since i cant see the “keto salad bowl” unless I’m ordering, it doesn’t show the nutrition value but other sources say it’s 7g net carbs. 

So i don’t want to consume 20g carbs right off the bat cause that’s my limit."

keto,Intermittent Fasting Question,"Long time lurker, first-time poster. I've been doing keto since January 1 and am pleased to have lost 25 lbs so far (30F / 5'4"" /SW: 191 / GW: 145). I've always tracked my macros closely and, aside from a few slip-ups, have made sure to keep my calories below 1350. I've seen so many posts about the benefits of adding IF to the mix and have recently (in the last week) tried to incorporate it into my routine (16/8) but am finding it difficult. Before doing IF, I would typically eat two meals in a day -- once around 11 AM and then another meal after my husband comes home from work around 8 PM or 8:30 PM.  While doing IF, I'm trying not to eat my first meal until 1 PM so I can keep my eating window open to eat with my husband, but I find myself obsessively thinking about eating from 11 AM - 1 PM. My question is this: if my caloric intake is the same, does it matter when I eat? Is IF likely to make a significant difference in my progress? Have you noticed a significant difference in your progress when fasting v. with no fasting? 

Thanks in advance for your insights! This sub has been invaluable to me and I am super grateful for any help."
keto,Keto and Carnivore Cycling?,"Hi, Folks! I've been on keto all year (New Year's Resolution!) in an effort to lose weight and get healthier. I also have been eating one-meal-a-day and walking 5-10 miles a day plus doing p90X for exercise. I was having good results, but hit a bit of a plateau in most of March. Starting in April, I began doing short-term cycling between carnivore and keto. I basically eat 0 carb carnivore during the week and switch to keto on the weekend, which I mentally consider as a cheat day. After eating 0 carb all week, a Blaze keto-crust pizza, keto friendly sweets, or keto fried chicken is a real treat! I do make sure to keep track of macros on these days and keep it under 20 net carbs. I also usually switch from one-meal-a-day to 20:4 intermittent fasting 1-2 days a week--which is another thing that feels like a treat! What has amazed me is how this change really jump started my weight after my March plateau. for the 3 weeks of April I have lost more than all but the first 3 weeks of starting Keto (which was mostly water weight, I assume).

Has anyone else has tried this approach? Does anyone see any potential drawbacks? Once I hit my goal weight, I would eventually like to do a version of this for maintenance--although in that case I would switch to keto during the week with some carb cycling on the weekends."
keto,Still feel like the big guy,"I’m 25 and Ive made huge changes over the last 1.5 years, quitting cigarettes, quitting soda and eating keto but I still feel big and look at myself as the big guy.

keto,Keto seems impossible,"Can someone please go out of their way to help me figure out a meal plan thats possible for me. I am temporarily sleeping in a family members garage due to no space in the main house. I don’t have any access to the kitchen. Which means I can’t cook or store food in the fridge. Im hoping to get an apartment soon. My diet is 100% fast food. I’ve turned into a fast food junkie. I drive Ubereats/Instacart ALL day. Keto seems impossible for me because I can not cook my meals or buy groceries. And I’m driving all day for work so my only option of food is out on the street. Im sure Theres keto friendly meals out there that I can buy at groceries stores that are ready-to-eat. And I’m sure there’s fast food/restaurants that are keto friendly. But I can’t seem to figure it out. Everyone I ask just tells me, I’m sure you can just ask to use the stove or im sure you can just have a couple things in the fridge. But my whole point is I have 0% access to it. So my only option is to eat out and all I been eating is drive thru junk food. Can someone give me a whole list of meals that don’t need to be cooked at home or prepared at home. It has to be all from the streets.

keto,How did I gain 5 lb overnight??,"Hello all and thanks for reading.
Long story short yesterday I was 181 and this morning I'm 186.  I've been in keto for just over a month and started at 194.

I have never broken 20 carbs but for one day was 23.
0 sugar and about  900 to 1000 calories a day.  

How? What did I do to put on 5lb overnight.  I step on the scale every morning after the bathroom at the same time. I've seen every day drop .5 to 1lb  and I was excited when I hit 181. And now I feel so shut down I don't get it."
keto,Suspicious of Electrolyte Powder,"I am in my third week of keto, feeling amazing. Got some Keppi electrolyte powder from Amazon. And it was gross at first sip and then suddenly I loved it. Then I was craving it all the time and I started to get paranoid about the some kind of hidden sugar that was making me want it all the time. I got is off axon and it's not like a brand you can google and make sure it's pure. So I tossed it out and  drinking pickle juice. Did I make a mistake? I would love to try another brand that for certain has no cable and sugar to see if I like it as much."
keto,Back on track!,"So back in February I posted on here to figure out why my weight loss had stalled.  Not sure if anyone remembers but I was the guy eating like a thousand calories of cheese per day and eating just enough protein for a small dog.  My weight had stalled around 265.  Well, since then I adjusted some things and I just weighed in at 250, and that's after I've already finished eating all my food for the day.  So thanks to the sub for the advice, 15 pounds in two months means I'm out of the stall and back in the steady progress.

For the past two months I've been eating a diet of cucumbers, celery, chicken, pork steaks, and eggs.  Reduced calorie mayo, hot sauce, and various spices keep it good and fun.  Realized my calcium sources are low so I'm going to start drinking unsweetened almond milk next week.  With the occasional treat of some mushrooms and pork rinds, that's going to be my diet until I hit somewhere around 150."
keto,Changes in back pain on keto or w/ weight loss?,"Hey everyone,

Wanted to start off by saying how inspiring this sub is. 

I restarted keto a couple weeks ago. I've done it in the past with good results, however went back to bad eating habits and no exercise and am looking to change that lifestyle.

My question is if anyone has noticed decrease in back pain after losing weight? My lower back is quite weak and pulls at least a few times a year. I know the excess weight around my stomach isn't helping. I was hoping anyone had some positive changes they could share! Just to remind me there are better days ahead lol.

Thanks in advance!"

keto,"Is there a new option for keto protein bars, now that Kirkland's are no longer keto? Or never were?","..or perhaps their bars never were keto, yet they seemed to work great for me when I last did keto.

keto,Should I continue Keto if I am having Covid symptoms?,"Hi - I have been following keto diet with some great results for about a month so I am definitely a fan. However, since a couple of days I am feeling covid symptoms and wanted to check with the community on whether I should continue the diet or give it a break for few days. As of now my main priority would be to feel better and not worry about my fat loss etc. 

I know Keto diet has therapeutic uses and all, but the diet consists of heavy slow digesting foods (at least what I have been eating so far). 
Any suggestions or guidance would be appreciated. 

Thanks!"
keto,Did you develop a strange taste? What could be the reason?,"Hey, there, ketoers!

If you don´t mind me asking, did you get any changes in how you taste food?


I´ve been more than 1 year on keto (whispering: with cheat meals every week) and it´s been always a good sign for me that sweet stuff taste veeery sweet, like I can eat a carrot and it tastes sweet, you know what I mean, right? This for me was always a sign that I´m keeping my sweets and carbs low. 


But recently I decided to go more strict on keto, try to go on without cheats and it´s like I´ve lost the taste. After 10 days with clean keto I started feeling very anxious (I´m definetely addicted to carbs) and decided to go for Chinese. Nothing crazy, not like noodles or anything, more like seafood with vegetables and... ok, dumplings. OK, so the weird thing is that I expected to have an explosion of flavour in my mouth with the dumplings but... nothing. SO WEIRD. 
So I took the shrimps and like meh, nothing. And same for the beef. No explosion of anything, it was like eating a paper sheet. It´s not the restaurant because I tried my usual eggs, sausauges and cucumber for breakfast the next day and usually it´s like super savory and fullfilling and... nothing. 


In order to check if it was that illness we all know, I took a piece of dark chocolate and it tasted so sweet I wanted to vomit. And I can smell my shower gel so that´s not it. I mean, the sweet flavour and smell are there but magnified. It´s like I can´t notice the savory flavours.

Im taking the usual keto supplements already prepared, with Mg, K, Na, vit D3, etc, the usual stuff. 


In summary: going more strict on keto, sweet flavours make me almost vomit and savory stuff taste like paperboard. Have you experienced this in your journey?? (It´s so annoying)"
keto,Keto and endurance sports,"Hi, I've been on keto diet for 2 1/2 months. This is for therapeutic reasons and it seems I might never be able to quit. Also, after hospitalization I'm trying to get back to good form. The good side is that I ended up pretty thin, which is unusual for me, but also weak. 

My sport is ultra long distance road cycling. It is purely endurance, so it should play well with keto. The main problem I see is the lack of low carb foods in random shops, restaurants and gas stations - the places I used to eat at.

I've been looking online after resources on self-supported sports or travels on keto, but so far found nothing more enlightening than ""take nuts and dark chocolate"".

Anyone had first-hand experience or could refer any resources? I'm not only interested in sport approach but also backcountry travel and camping, as those are my hobbies too."
keto,Flank pain,"Hi, guys. I started keto on the 17th of April. Everything was going ok, until yesterday. At about 6 pm I started having pain on my left side, between the last rib and my hip - flank pain. 

F, 21, 5'5. 99g protein, 113g fat, 20g carbs. 1498 cals. 

I woke up today and I still have this pain. I talked to my neighbour (she is a registered nurse) and said it could be a muscular pain or I might be passing a kidney stone and advised me to drink lots &amp; lots of water. 
Tbh I don't think is muscular, it does not feel like it. This pain feels very deep inside, is dull and it comes in waves. It also spreads to my abdomen. Not sure about kidney stone either. 
I don't have any other symptoms. I feel perfectly fine otherwise. 

Is it possible that the transition into ketosis is putting my kidneys under 'stress'? Could it be electrolytes? 
Anybody been in a similar situation, what did you do? What worked for you? Thanks. 


P.S: I know that I should contact my doctor about this, don't lecture me on that, please. I will if it really doesn't go away/it gets worse. Just curious if anybody else experienced this."

keto,Higher protein with a large caloric defecit...,"So I've used keto-calculator and there's a line in there about higher protein levels being ok if you're in a large calorie defecit, but there's no range for what's ok... I'm taking on a pretty severe defecit for 3 months and want to check if the ratios below seem plausible (5/40/55 split) for keto. I've had good success in previous years with keto but struggled to get the fat high and protein low enough, avoiding the carbs hasn't been too much of an issue so these ratios seem good to me.

keto,I hate mushy foods! Suggestions?,"I find much of keto centric foods are mush... like eggs / cooked veg.   Can never go wrong with meats, but I crave texture in my foods... I miss crispy chips / toasted grains / etc!    
I also hate veg in general lol... but I'll eat anything in sandwich form...(which aren't keto...)  


So yeah... I like simple garbage foods... but I'm stuck with keto options; suggestions please!

keto,What's the point in Ketosis?,"I understand a low carb diet's affect on the blood sugar for Diabetics but what is the point in regards to weightloss? You still have to count calories so it's a CICO diet with limitations? I have been in Ketosis for 3 weeks (16+ ketone level every day) and having 15-20g carbs and if I don't limit my calories drastically, then I do not lose weight. What is the actual benefit regarding weightloss when it comes to ketosis?"
keto,I feel down after eating,"So I just restarted keto to make my extended fasts easier for me. I like the way I feel when I'm fasted. I fast -- yes, partly for the weightloss of course -- for mental health reasons. I find that I'm just on an elevated state of mind on 3 or 4 days of fasting. I used to break my fasts with anything I wanted (mostly carbs) and I felt fine, with strong hunger pangs when restarting the fast (that I got used to).

But now, I just broke my 36-hour fast with a ketogenic meal and I've been feeling really down until now (4 hours after eating). I just feel sleepy and sad, sluggish you could say. This has happened to me in the past too (I guess?) when I would start keto around days 3-5, I would get depressive episodes. 

Any similar experiences when starting keto or is it just me? Is this maybe a form of sugar withdrawal?"
keto,What do you do when you crave for your favorite food before keto during your time of the month?,I just started keto 2 weeks ago. So far I'm doing okay. But there are times when I crave for specific food which are not keto friendly. I try the keto alternative but it just doesn't satisfy the craving. These cravings are driven by hormones for any women out there. (I'm nearing my time of the month) How do you handle situations like these? Will this get easier with time?
keto,New Body Pains?,"I started Keto about three months ago, lost over 20 lbs. I look noticeably younger. Just got some blood-work done and everything looked better than it did before I started.

One thing that has bothered me a bit is feelings from my body that I don't recognize. This could just be a symptom of being a lower weight than I've been since I was graduating high school, but I wanted to ask if other people have experienced anything like this.

For example, when I'm hungry, I feel a dull light pain in the upper right side of my chest that I'm unfamiliar with. It's not a strong enough pain to be major cause for concern, but it's just not a feeling I remember having before. Has Keto produced any odd feelings from your body?"

keto,Oroweat jumped on the keto bandwagon,"[https://imgur.com/gallery/x0apCtb](https://imgur.com/gallery/x0apCtb)

I saw this at FoodMaxx. I've never set foot in one before, but it's the only store in my area that carries Old Orchard Healthy Balance Apple Juice, which I wanted to try. (The quest for keto products is having me go shopping in so many new places. LOL! I've gone to Wal-Mart more times in the past 3 months than I have in the previous 3 years, I think.)

Like Franz keto bread, Oroweat uses modified wheat starch, but this particular recipe yields 3g net carbs compared to 0g net carbs for Franz. 

I have too much bread right now, so I didn't pick this up. I typically buy Artisan Bakers keto bread from Costco. Artisan's primary ingredient is resistant tapioca starch, and like Franz, Artisan Bakers is also 0g net carbs. Even though Oroweat has 3g net carbs, I may give it a shot if I'm ever in FoodMaxx again for the apple juice."
keto,Help,"I have tried so many different diets and keto has by far been the most sustainable and enjoyable diet I’ve ever done. So much so, that I can’t even call it a diet. More like a lifestyle. But today, I didn’t just fall off of the wagon, I jumped straight off of the cliff. 

My dog of 15 years passed away yesterday and to say that I am heartbroken about it is an understatement. I’ve always been an emotional eater. Today, me and my husband ordered Asian food and before I knew it, I found myself eating almost an entire container of pad Thai and fried shrimp. It didn’t do anything to make me feel better about my dog, that’s for sure. I already know I kicked myself out of ketosis but I just need some help figuring out exactly how much damage I did and what I need to do to get back on the right track.

keto,Best I’ve felt in 20 years,"To all of you out there who are considering trying the keto diet, I hope that the story of my journey might be the final push you need.  

The last time I was at a healthy body weight was 20 years ago in college.  Since then I slowly started adding on pounds and becoming less active.  Reaching 280 lbs in august of 2020 was a wake up call. I did some research and within 48 hours was transitioning myself into a lower carb higher fat diet.

As of today, just eight short months later, I am down to 199 pounds and feel better than I have in decades.  My middle aged belly that I thought I would never get rid of is practically nonexistent now. I went from a size 42 waste to a size 34 and from xxl shirts to large. All of this was achieved with only mild exercise three or four times per week. 

The results speak for themselves."

keto,3 months progress,"Long-time lurker, I finally feel like I deserve my first post.

I've been taking pictures now and then, but didn't see much of a difference. I've always been weird like that, and that's how I gained so much weight and never noticed.

Until i weighed myself, just because I was curious, after being unhappy with my body my whole life, i stopped caring. But... and it was a big butt in did, I realized I was finally obese, at my heaviest ever 77kg, at 1.57m (5'2'') that's a whole lot.

The word obese scared me, even though I didn't have any health issues, I was hitting 30 this year and absolutely sure if I followed on this path, the issues were gonna catch up to me.

So I weighed (hah) my options, and frankly, nothing ever worked, I was always hungry or craving stuff. Then, I came across this sub, and saw you guys making delicious food, encouraging each other and being supportive all around. And I said to myself I'd give it a go.

Aaaaand here we are, 3 months later, I'm extremely happy, even though I still have a long way to go, I feel I might not fail this time.

So thank you for existing, you are a wonderful community!!"
keto,STOMACH TROUBLES,"Ok so I was on Keto for about 20 days or so, and yesterday I gave in and ate a bunch of carbs (rice, naan, fruit, cake... it was bad but so good at the same time lol). So today, my stomach has been grumbling super loudly. And I feel like I hate this weird gas in my stomach that pops inside instead of becoming a fart if that makes sense. Is this normal when someone is off keto or could I have a potential gluten sensitivity (bc I obvi had a lot of gluten yesterday to)

Also to put things into more context, I’ve had weird stomach grumbles for a while, but on keto they stopped a bit, and today they’re back stronger than ever. I’ve had a feeling I could have a gluten sensitivity but I’m not sure"
keto,Dealing with Emotional Eating Relapses,"I've been trying keto for about a month, and have noticed health benefits (more energy, less inflammation, clearer thinking, some weight loss). However, twice so far I've ""relapsed"" and consumed simple carbs, knocking me out of ketosis. At both of these times, it's been at moments at which I've felt emotional strain: depression, boredom. I've felt unhappy and drowned my sorrow in some Ben and Jerry's. 

Each time I've done this, it's certainly been temporarily satisfying, but I've also noticed that it has produced a lot of anxiety when I switch out of ketosis (imagine this could be from the decreased GABA production when I move back into glycolysis, but it's a curious effect). I wondered if any of you folks had suggestions for how to deal with this emotional eating? If you feel tempted to gorge on sh\*tty carbs for emotional reasons, how do you deal with it? Are there any replacement activities you could suggest that might break me out of the ""NEED-ICE-CREAM!"" thought loop? Are there are any comfort foods you allow yourself on keto that might serve a similar Ben-and-Jerry's-esque function without breaking ketosis?"
keto,Some Ideas about How Keto &amp; Fasting Can Be Used Together for Weight Loss,"Recently I wrote an article and tried to put together a fairly foolproof framework for losing weight with intermittent fasting, keto, and some slightly longer fasts as well.  

I based the plan on research I've done over the past few years (different books, articles, podcasts, etc), individual success stories I've seen, and of course some of my own experience experience as well.

Here's a basic summary in case you find it useful :)

1)  Start with time-restricted eating (TRE) for a couple months or more.  Gradually shrink your eating window, slowly, so your body has some time to adapt.  

If it's working, keep going.  

A lot of people have success and reach their weight-loss goals just by doing daily TRE. 

Other people plateau after a while, and may need to try something different.

2)  Doing a ketogenic diet for at least a couple months can help get you ""fat-adapted"", and makes it easier to fast (and easier to lose body fat).

It also helps to do the ketogenic diet for a few days or more before any longer fasts. Getting your ketones up in advance significantly smooths the transition into fasting.

3)  If you've done TRE and/or keto for a while and hit any sort of weight loss plateau, one option is to try some medium-length fasts.  These are great for breaking through plateaus.

Doing a 24 hour or 36 hour fast a couple times a week is a pretty good protocol, but you can always adapt to your individual circumstances.

4) Longer fasts (&gt;36 hours) are optional, typically they're not necessary to reach your weight-loss goals. But they do have some additional health benefits, and can also speed up your weight loss.

5) Once you reach your weight-loss goal, mix and match low carb, different fasting durations, etc to balance things out and maintain your progress.

Overall, be patient, take it slow, and notice non-scale victories as well.  Your health can improve even when your weight stays the same!

That's a high level summary, but if you want more details feel free to check out the full article (and I'd be happy to hear your feedback, or personal experiences):

keto,Indian Curries + Cauliflower Rice,Has anyone discovered the joys of adding spicy Indian curries to cauliflower rice? A small amount goes a long way so the meal is keto enough. The only thing to watch out for is the bad oils in some of the curries. Haven’t found a tastier way to enjoy cauliflower rice.
keto,Am I doing something wrong?,"I see people losing lots of weight quickly and I have been on keto under 20 carbs a day, 1600-1800 calories a day, exercising at least 30 min and burning at least 500 calories a day (using my Apple Watch to keep myself on track and calorie/net carb tracker) I have only lost 3lbs (well, 2.8lbs) in a month. Is there something I am possibly doing wrong or is this normal? I am currently at 22% body fat, maybe being lower body fat percentage it’s slower? I’m not sure, any insight helps, thanks!"
keto,Your path is YOURS.,"Do exactly what works for you.  Let NO ONE stop you.  Find what works best for you, and let nothing prevent you from doing what you know to be right for you.  Your results will be your shield, proof, and belong solely to you.  

I eat the same 3 meals every single day, prepped in the morning and ready.  They keep easily into ketosis.  I am never hungry, and I do not eat outside of those meals.  I am different though, I view food solely as fuel.  It is no way social for me.   I do not weight myself at all.

I work out every morning except Sunday for 30 mins, HIIT only, rotating total body weights, oversized speed/heavy bag, and running twice a week each.  First thing in the morning, no chance to have a schedule conflict, it is a priority.  It is also low impact, low chance of any injury.

I have lost 130 lbs in 3 years and still average 3 lbs loss a year.   Immaculate physicals except for elevated cholesterol.  No health issues, even a cold in 3 years.

The less of a big deal you make of your efforts, the easier to fly under the radar.  I do not share keto or my efforts, because most that ask how I look so great do not really care how, just a nice way to comment me my physical appearance/change.  I do not hide it, but I do not share much unless there is a real desire to know what I have done.  

&amp;#x200B;

I write this pretending you have.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck."
keto,Havent noticed much difference?,I have been doing keto for a couple weeks and i went from eating very healthy before (lots of fruits and veggies) to keto and I've never been much of a meat eater. But i wanted to try this to lose a few pounds. I have been tracking my macros and I don't eat more that 20 net carbs a day yet ive only lost .5 of a pound. Ive also been exercising... I also feel tired and sleepy. Around day 3 and 4 i had a lot of energy but ever since i just feel sleepy all the time and i feel gross from eating so much fat. I also drink a ton of water and use electrolytes and take b12. has anyone had similar issues?
keto,How much and how often do you guys take any supplemental salt? I can never remember to stay on top of it and I keep going through a day of feeling like garbage before I realize what's wrong.,"How much and how often do you guys take any supplemental salt? I can never remember to stay on top of it and I keep going through a day of feeling like garbage before I realize what's wrong.

I use Windsor Half Salt (sodium and potassium) and mix it into some flavoured water when I feel like I need it, but I'm always just pouring some in until it seems like a good amount. Is there a standard amount of extra salt I should be taking consistently/proactively, or should I just wing it and go by how I feel?"
keto,Back pain gone,"I had pretty intense back pain due to a sports injury I suffered five years ago. It was debilitating and I have been looking at surgery.

Started keto April 1. Haven’t lost a ton of weight, but my back isn’t in pain anymore. I’m moving much better and the constant ache/throb has subsided. I can’t tell you how much my back pain impacted every aspect of my life. 

I need to lose a good amount of weight (6’2/330) and I hope to start seeing the results there, but just for the reduced back pain this has been incredible."
keto,Simple meals,"I have a whole bunch of skin issues that are triggered by foods.  I’m keto without most nuts, shellfish, dairy, eggs, or salads.  Sadly, I can’t have a number of veggies.

I mostly eat meat or fish and a veggie.  Anyone else have a similar situation?  How do you deal with the limited menu?"

And can I quit keto with some oatmeal? Or is it too much?"
keto,3-month Lipid results: NSV-ish,"I got my cholesterol checked a bit over 3 months into keto and got my results back today. Overall, pretty good, but could be improved. 3 months may not be that long a period to see firm results but at least they are going in the right direction.

I've read the r/keto FAQ and it sounds like total cholesterol is next to useless, and LDL isn't the whole picture, what's important is the LDL particle count. I tried to get my PCP to test for LDL-P but she wasn't sure how (said that it was only really measured in clinical studies), but made sure I had Apolipoprotein A-1 tested. 

You can see my cholesterol tracking since late 2015 here: [https://imgur.com/SMeZZuQ](https://imgur.com/SMeZZuQ)

*Though my trigs were actually pretty low in 2015, the only thing I was doing differently was I went gluten free for a while just to try it. I'm not sure what else it could be, but those low trigs seem to be an outlier.*

It appears that it's the ratio between ApoA1 and ApoB that's important for estimating coronary disease, and while ApoB wasn't tested, its value can be calculated with reasonable accuracy if you know your LDL and trig scores.

[https://cardiab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2840-11-55#:\~:text=Results,0.936%20(0.935%2C0.937)](https://cardiab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2840-11-55#:~:text=Results,0.936%20(0.935%2C0.937))).

 The equation is:  ApoB = −33.12 + 0.675\*LDL + 11.95\*ln(tg)

So, with one measurement of my ApoA1 (142mg/dL, which is good) I am able to get my ApoB/ApoA1 ratio, which turns out to be a little high at 0.92.

Another meaningful indicator of coronary health is the Trig/HCL ratio, which for me is good, at about 1.7, though in the past it's been not so good, typically at around 3 but up to 5.

[https://www.beyondthebrain.net/blog/the-importance-of-the-triglyceridehdl-ratio](https://www.beyondthebrain.net/blog/the-importance-of-the-triglyceridehdl-ratio)

See my trig/HDL ratio over time here: [https://imgur.com/HQQBlbl](https://imgur.com/HQQBlbl)

**Overall I'm reasonably encouraged!** 

Areas I want to improve are trying to get back to a higher HDL level (currently 50, but was at 63 in October 2020), and try to lower that ApoB level. To do so, I'm going to try to up my oily fish intake (was already eating salmon and mackerel at least once a week, if not more frequently), and significantly increase my moderate to vigorous exercise (I've hardly even been going on walks over the last 3 months). I'll also try to get better sleep, as I'm often getting less than 6 since it's that time after everyone else is in bed that I have time to myself. Also, coffee is associated with increased ApoB so I'm going to try cut the frequency in half. I have a small coffeemaker but it still makes about 20oz of coffee at a time, or 2.5 cups. [https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/apolipoprotein-b/](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/apolipoprotein-b/)

Also, will see if I can slightly reduce my saturated fat intake and maybe fry my eggs less often in butter, but this will be a lower priority. I'm already eating a good amount of almonds and pecans every day.

Thanks to r/keto for the encouragement and knowledge!"

keto,Ketosis progress questions,"Hi guys! I'm on my third week of keto and I got a couple questions for you. 

1) How can I tell if I am kicked out of Ketosis by using a device that measures the amount of ketones in your blood? Scenario would be like I ate a lot of pizza and I wanted to meausre my blood ketone level before, after 1hr, and after 8 hours. After 24 hours Im assuming I'd be back in Ketosis. Not that I ate pizza this weekend, but I did have quite a bit of snacks this weekend (e.g. almonds and fat-based dip) which have some carbs. as well as a few crystal light drink which has 2 carbs. In the worst case, if I slip up for a day, a weekend, a week...do I lose my progress towards sustained ketosis / working towards fat adaptation, like is it reset? Or would I just gain a bunch of water weight and then lose it when my body re-enters ketosis.

Basically what I am wondering is if I can be making ketones and be out of ketosis somehow...and if there's ""lag time"" between my ketosis state and blood ketones. In other words, does my meter even tell me anything useful when id need it? 

2) Can you tell that you are fat adapted by any means (i.e. ketone meter) or is it all kinda subjective experiences? Its my third week of Keto. I am obese so its not like getting fat adapted will be hard, theres plenty of it."
keto,Two weeks in Weight Loss and dealing with cravings,"Hey, 

Long time no see. Two years ago I posted about how I lost so much weight I also lost my shorts at the grocery store standing in line. Well I got off keto and gained all the weight back and tried restarting once or twice and just never stuck with it past a few days.

This time around I have been focusing on not looking at Keto as something I have to do, but rather as something I want to do and it’s been much easier. Just last night I felt like I was starving and didn’t give into my cravings. I treated myself to a protein bar and a glass of water and went to bed. In the past I probably would have gave in and got chips or something.

I stepped on the scale a few weeks ago and saw 228 and decided enough was enough. I will lose the weight or die trying. I’ve been fairly strict keto since. 

I’ve dropped down from 228 to 215ish as of this morning since April 8th. From April 8th to April 12th I wasn’t fully committed but gradually started cutting out carbs. Since the 12th I’ve been strict keto and the weight has been falling off steadily ever since.

I haven’t gotten keto flu, and I have not been supplementing with electrolytes at all as of yet and I’ve been feeling great. The first time I was really successful with keto I wasn’t supplementing electrolytes either and felt fantastic the whole time. 

The second and third time I tried keto I started getting all sorts of heart flutters and generally felt like crap, but I was supplementing electrolytes so I think that may have had a factor for me. Not saying at all that others shouldn’t need to supplement. Just for me I feel better without doing so.

To all the others who are struggling with this as well: I recommend really digging down deep and seeing why you want this. I know I had to face some stuff internally that I didn’t want to in order to change my mind set on eating differently. I think that I’ll be more successful this time than I was in the past.

I’m kind of writing this for myself, some motivation to keep with it. I’m feeling great so far and trying to remember I gained the weight over time and this isn’t going to be a magic bullet to drop the weight over night, though it feels like my progress is slow (I know I’m making fantastic progress)."
keto,1st Week Experience,"Just wanted to share my experience after one week of keto and intermittent fasting (IF) for any lurkers who may be thinking about starting keto. 

For a very brief background on why I started keto and IF, over the last 5-ish years I've gone from 160ish lbs to 180ish lbs and back three or four times. Well, I'm 23 in a couple of weeks here and I'll say my body is definitely not the same as it was in my late teens. I started putting on weight faster and finding it harder to lose than before, without really changing the diet or exercise regime that I did to lose that weight previously. I got to almost 190 lbs this time and was feeling pretty damn bad about myself since it was the heaviest I'd ever been. Enter: a friend who told me about keto. 

I did quite a bit of reading and preparation before starting, which I highly recommend as this diet can be difficult if you don't know what you're doing, but more importantly it can be very unsafe. 

Before beginning, I calculated both my macros and how many calories I needed to be in a good 30%+ caloric deficit. 

During the first two-ish days I felt just fine. Adjusting to IF was easy as I've done IF before, only keto was new to me. On day three though I got two ""keto flu"" symptoms, I became lightheaded very often and suffered from nausea here and there. I had been tracking everything I ate and drank with MyFitnessPal, so after checking my nutrition tab, lo and behold I was getting less than 1/4 of the potassium and magnesium my body needs (you need to put your research into practice, gang...)

After getting K1000 brand electrolyte mix, NO-salt, and a magnesium supplement and I started taking them, these symptoms went away completely. Fast forward to the end of day 7, yesterday, I felt amazing. I have more energy than I did before, I feel more motivated to keep up with my fitness routine, and I really feel like I have more mental clarity at work. 

I lost 8lbs the first week, of which I believe 3lbs were fat. I'm thinking this because I lost 5lbs very quickly and then leveled out with no weight lost for 2 days. The initial 5lbs should all be water weight I believe. 

Summary: if you're thinking about starting out on keto, I would recommend giving it a shot. BUT expect the first week to be rough and make sure you really understand your macros and GET YOUR ELECTROLYTES!! 

Excited to see how much I lose by my birthday, which will be my 5-weeks-on-keto mark."
keto,Would you ever recommend a month of OMEOD &amp; Keto?,"I am not sure whether this is sustainable, but I wanted to either do OMAD and Keto, or OMEOD (48 hour fasting, 1 1500 calorie meal every other day) and keto. I know it isn’t sustainable, but that’s why I was thinking of only doing it for 1 month"

keto,Has keto helped you with bloating?,"I’m starting Keto tomorrow. I’ve had _huge_ issues with bloating for six months now since I got a round of strong antibiotics. I get bloated after everything I eat. Now, I eat paleo-ish; no gluten, no refined sugars and no dairy except for Ghee. I’m not sure, but I think that carbs makes my bloating worse.

So, as the title reads, I wonder if Keto has helped some of you guys with bloating?"
keto,Newb to Keto,"My primary care physician had suggested I go keto recently for a multitude of health reasons. I have just finished reading the beginners guide to keto; I appreciate this type of book because of how directive it is but I am now struggling with how to modify it into my diet. I cannot have any dairy, not even cooked in as an ingredient, because we assume I am lactose intolerant (not yet dx'd because of covid, sigh) and I try to use almonds sparingly since my mother was around my age when she developed a severe allergy to them. With ingredients seemingly being particularly chosen for keto (ex. no soy milk because soy has been genetically modified), I am kind of out to sea on this topic. What have others, especially at the beginning stages of switching to keto, done to eliminate or sub dairy and almonds? Thank you!"
keto,Lost 10lbs in 3 weeks eating LOW CAL while still eating carbs,"Hi! I’m not here to take anything away from anyone who is on keto and it’s working well - it’s just in my experience - as someone who has had thyroid removed and am on medications for a mood disorder -  keto did not work for me. Everywhere I looked when I started working on my weight loss told me keto was the magical cure and I wouldn’t even have to exercise to shed the pounds. But that just didn’t happen.

Some stats: 5”2 and 127lbs and trying to get back to old weight 114) 

I’m just looking for people with a similar starting point to me (with thyroid problems / being on meds) and what your experience with weight loss has been? 

For ME, I started exercising twice a day (roughly 2 hours - 1 hour strength / resistance (reformer Pilates) and 1 hour dance cardio (BBS) and eating around 800-1000 calories a day plus IF 18:6.

I’ve done this for 3 weeks and lost 10lbs. I didn’t cut carbs out I just ate around 50-100g.

All this to say that if you have problems with your thyroid it’s possible that keto won’t work for you no matter what most people say - and you don’t HAVE to demonize carbs, fruits and veggies.

Eating healthy but less has worked better for me than any other diet."
keto,Which artificial sweetener is better?,"Hey y’all!

keto,Are Quest chips lying about their carb count??,"My hubby and I recently got back into keto after going on a break and this time around, we discovered Quest chips which we thought would make it easier. We limited ourselves to a bag a day. We've been in and out of keto several times so we know how things go.  However, this time around with the Quest chips, it took a lot longer to go into ketosis. We were a little puzzled and trying to figure out why so finally we decided to cut out the chips to see if it was the culprit.  Well, it definitely was!!! Now we are *so* suspicious of the chips and I have read that these chips have stalled other keto'ers and also that there had been a class action lawsuit 7 years ago, a FDA investigation, and seems to be another recent NY case regarding their bars!  What do you guys think?"
keto,"Stevia Glycerite: Is it Keto, safe for IF, and why is there no accurate or direct nutrition info for it?","I have been using Kal Liquid Stevia and NOW Stevia Glycerite because they dont use alcohol or have a bitter aftertaste. The stevia is distilled in vegetable glycerine and water instead of alcohol and water to eliminate the bitter taste. What I found was, vegetable glycerine by itself has 4.3 cals per tsp. NOW company admitted to me that 10 drops (double serving) of their product would equal 0 carbs and 1 calorie in spite of the fact the nutrition says 0 cals (per 5 drop serving). KAL swears up and down their product is 0 cal and 0 carb even if you use a tsp (which is like, 5 whole pipettes full- 100 drops). Im not sure what to belive. My concern is, I know neither product spikes my glucose, but would the calories break IF? I do 18/6 IF and out of fear, avoid using these brands in my fasting window. Does anyone know any advanced info or nutrition in regards to stevia glycerite? All I know is it is considered sugar alcohol which is why it's 0 carbs- but does it really have calories? Does it matter how much or what kind of vegetable glycerine each company uses?"
keto,Lost 110 pounds in less than a year !,"[Progress](https://imgur.com/gallery/5yoEiCr)

Last year around March I've lost a job at the same time Covid shut down everything in my area, I spent a month in my bed browsing memes on the internet until I met someone who successfully lost around 100 pounds with keto. I was tired of being in my bed, in a situation I couldn't control and knew Covid would be the perfect opportunity to train hard, eat better and fix myself.
I've suffered from huge back pain for years and lost a lot of money on chiropractors when the only issue was my weight and lack of exercise. (I couldn't tie my shoes it was too painful to bend over but now I can rest the palm of my hands on the floor in that position !)

Time has come.

I hopped into the keto bandwagon and did intermittent fasting everyday. My diet was mostly made of fish, charcuterie, cheese, almond milk isolate shakes and lots of low carb veggies.
My appetite decreased over time like pure magic.
I cut down in half every portions of the amount of food i've used to eat and limited myself to three meals a day, sometimes two, no snacking. I also took potassium and magnesium supplements just in case.

To introduce myself to consistant exercise, I promised myself to do 30 mins a day of cardiovascular training, nothing else. Eliptical was my training of choice, then later I discovered a passion for jogging. I recently ran  a half marathon in 2 hours, I couldn't believe it. I still pinch myself to know if i'm dreaming or not.

I did that, only that from April 2020 to January 2021.
10 Months, went from 250lbs to 140lbs.
No excess, only 30 mins a day of jogging and a stable keto diet (with a cheat meal on Fridays for me.)

I must say I'm proud, happy and I can't believe it.
If I had to do it again I would certainly retake the challenge without hesitating.
Sadly, I saw a lot of people around me gaining a lot of weight during the quarantine and I truly hope my story will spark a little light of motivation in them."

keto,Keto + GERD. Is it possible?,"In 2017 I lost 100 pounds with strict keto and felt great. Managed to keep it off with on-and-off lazy keto until falling off the keto wagon completely at the end of 2019. In the middle of 2020 I tried keto again but started experiencing GERD symptoms that were first misdiagnosed as sinus and asthma issues. In December a veteran ENT immediately recognized it as ""silent reflux"" aka GERD and told me to do an elimination diet: cut out all fatty and acidic foods, coffee, and carbonated drinks. The elimination diet helped until I came down with a terrible norovirus (stomach flu) over St. Patrick's Day this year; everything afterwards made my stomach hurt and nauseous as hell. Saw another random doctor - due to my PCP being overbooked - said my post-stomach flu issues was due to GERD and prescribed me to continue a bland diet and take 40mg PPI pills every morning. He also lectured me about my weight -- with neither advice nor a referral to a nutritionist -- which pissed me off.

While the meds have helped, my weight continues to creep up because a GERD-friendly diet is kryptonite to people with PCOS and insulin resistance. I love keto. I miss it. And I desperately need to get back to losing weight because it is wreaking havoc on my knees and ankles. This week I've been 75% immobile - only getting up to let my dog outside - because my knees are so swollen and stiff with obesity-related osteoarthritis. I am also tired all the time because my body can't handle the glucose from eating a bland diet, not to mention my hormones are out of whack. 

So in a nutshell: I feel like I am stuck between a rock and hard place having to choose between saving my esophagus or saving myself from type 2 diabetes. I know keto will help **my whole body** feel better but I don't want to disobey doctor's orders by starting keto again. What I want to know is if there are some people here who manage to do keto with GERD that can be managed with PPI drugs?

Tldr; is there anyone here that does keto with GERD that successfully manages it with PPI drugs?"

It wasn't until later that I figured I'd take a picture of the nutrition label too to share with others.

Apart from these items, the store I went to had the usual Artisan Bakers Keto Bread and the Innofoods Coconut Keto Clusters. I'm glad those are still selling well enough for Costco to continue carrying."
keto,Continuous glucose monitor,"Anyone use one of these? I have impaired fasting glucose and I signed up for this system/program called January. They will send a request to my doc for a prescription. They use Freestyle Libre for their program. Just curious if anyone is familiar with this program or has used it. I’m a nurse practitioner and have done keto before. Need to start agin, but I am REALLY interested in finding out how different food affect my blood sugar."
keto,How many grams of carbs does it take you guys to get kicked out of ketosis?,I mostly stick to eating no sugar but sometimes I will cheat (once a month maybe) and have an ice cream. And I’ll check my ketones a few hours after and the next day and I’m still producing them. You would think something like an ice cream would kick you out of ketosis. Can anyone explain this thanks!
keto,Monk fruit recommendations?,"Swerve just isn’t cutting it for me, and monk fruit is probably the only natural sweetener I haven’t tried yet. It isn’t in stores anywhere near me and there are so many brands and “blends” online I don’t know which one to pick! Would love to hear suggestions."
keto,Been the same weight for a year - what am I doing wrong?,"Why in God’s name am I not losing weight? Four years ago I was 317. I am now 237. I lost the weight thanks to Keto. It’s the only thing that has ever worked. I’ve been between 236 - 241 for a year. My BMI is still in the 40’s so I certainly have more to lose. I monitor my ketones using finger prick blood testing. Typically I’m between 0.9 and 1.9. Most often right around 1.4. This seems average for me even when I was actively losing a lot of weight. On occasion it goes past 2.0 but not real often. 

I’ve tried so many little tweaks and nothing has made a difference. Most recently I slashed my protein in hopes that my liver was doing me wrong and converting protein to glucose. I do intermittent fasting, anywhere from 24 to 36 hours. Carbs are always 20 or under. I thought maybe my keto cheesecake wasn’t helping so I cut that out. I don’t need any keto sweets. I have pecans if I’m wanting a treat. On average my daily fat intake is about 80 grams. 

I walk 5-7 days a week, depending on the weather. 

What am I missing?"
keto,What is your strategy for bolusing for net carbs? (T1D),"Last week, my endo recommended I try SlimFast Fat Bomb peanut butter cups.  They have 7 carbs and 2 net carbs.  I don't recall if she told me how she boluses for them (or if she did).  I have seen people say that they only bolus for the net carbs in things and are fine.  I bolused for all 7 carbs (I was a bit nervous about bolusing for so little) and that worked out.  I'm just curious as to what other people's strategies are?  Things with diabetes change so quickly that tomorrow I could bolus for the same thing in the same way and have it be a complete distaster, so I want a few methods lined up in case my method stops working."
keto,Second time around and I have diarrhea,I did keto for about a month and a half january through March 2021. Lost 20 pounds. Never had diarrhea. I had solid stools once every two days. Got back on keto last Wednesday and I'm having diarrhea. I know it's a common symptom but why would my body react differently the second time around? Has anyone had this happen?
keto,Anyone feel depressed after breaking keto?,"So was on keto this week, I broke it last night after fasting about 20ish hrs. Also had a few drinks. Didn't sleep very well, felt very out of it today. I had eggs, chicken, and guac for brunch. Starting to feel more back to normal now but was way down and spaced out earlier."
keto,Has anyone tried these brands of Monk Fruit?,"We've been eating a lot of Lakanto monk fruit from COSTCO, but they've been sold out for months. I found these two cheaper brands on Amazon, and I'm wondering if anyone has tried them (Milliard and Microingredients)?

keto,Green Tea,"[Green Tea](https://sites.google.com/view/best-teas-to-lose-weight-/accueil) 

Green tea is one of the most well-known types of tea, and is linked with many health benefits.

It’s also one of the most effective teas for weight loss. There is substantial evidence linking green tea to decreases in both weight and body fat.

In one 2008 study, 60 obese people followed a standardized diet for 12 weeks while regularly drinking either green tea or a placebo.

Over the course of the study, those who drank green tea lost 7.3 pounds (3.3 kg) more weight than the placebo group 

Another study found that people who consumed green tea extract for 12 weeks experienced significant decreases in body weight, body fat and waist circumference, compared to a control group"
keto,Is it a plateau if it just isn't working?,"So i lost roughly 50 pounds on keto a few years ago. So i kinda know how it works....
My gf and i decided to try it again about a month ago. Weve been on it for a month. We are tracking carbs and have maintained low carbs based on our weight/height. Our keto sticks (fwiw) show we are excreting ketones. 

I lost five pounds the first week and got stuck, she's lost two and is thinking about giving up. her goal is only ten pounds.

keto,Happy hour deals…,When I was coming back from a trip we stopped by this place that had wing happy hour from 3-6. Since fat and proteins are more expensive than regular diets I was hoping we could discuss good keto restaurant happy hour deals like that one and how to find these deals in our local Restaurants.
keto,Getting back on the horse,"Last year I lost about 30lbs give or take doing keto, well at the end of January I went through some personal struggles and then moved in February. I used the stress from all this as an excuse to indulge and basically fell completely off of keto for two months and have fallen into my old fast food diet routine. This week I weighed myself and found out in I gained almost all of the weight I spent 6 months loosing back. I'm not letting this discourage me though and I am back with avengeance. I'm starting off easy with atkins and keto frozen meals and will gradually going to impliment meal prep back into my schedule. Sorry food addiction but your to toxic for me, bye."
keto,Black Soybeans - Change in nutrition label,"Black Soybeans (canned) from Eden foods used to have the following nutrition information (per 130 g)

120 calories  
7g fat  
11g protein  
8g carbohydrates  
7g fiber  
1g net carbs

Which was pretty attractive. Unfortunately, they recently changed their label quite dramatically so it is now:

130 calories  
4.5g fat  
11g protein  
**11**g carbohydrates  
**6**g fiber  
**5**g net carbs

That's a pretty dramatic change."
keto,"BLOATED STOMACH, WHY GOD WHY.","So, I started keto. It hasn't even been a whole week yet, and somehow my belly is the biggest it's ever been. However according to my scale I have supposedly lost a little weight?  
I was wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar? Please tell me what happend after you got a bloated stomach on keto!!!"
keto,The journey is full of ups and downs,"I just want to tell anyone trying keto to keep going!  It may seem like you are stuck at a certain weight or nothing is happening, but give it time.  I have been on keto for over 2 years and didn’t really track my weight in the beginning. 

I bought a Wyze scale to track my progress and it has been amazing for tracking!  I have had it for a year now and it’s been great. There were a few months it felt like I wasn’t losing any more weight and I was destined to hover above 190 lbs. but I finally broke through that barrier!  After seeing the scale go up and down, up and down I now see 187 and now consistently under 190. 

I highly suggest getting this scale as it tracks many different metrics and is only $20 plus shipping!  Remember to weigh yourself at the same time each day. I weigh right before I get in the shower in the morning.

keto,Thought about Offal(Organ Meats),"I've never really eaten any organ meats but they seem to be one of the most nutrient-dense foods out there.

At the same time, they seem to have much higher levels of HDL cholesterol(at least 5x higher compared to lean meat).  There are also some supposed risks of organ meats have toxins in them.

My family has a history of heart disease and I'm trying to decide whether I should start eating Offal such as Brain, Liver, heart, etc.  

Most of the research I've done about HDL seems to be inconclusive. I'm trying to figure out if I should start eating offal, after all the nutritional benefits seem insane.

  
Has anyone here had a positive experience with offal? And wonder how noticeable the health benefits were for you."
keto,Maintenance,"I have been eating Keto for 11 months.  It has been SLOW going, but have kept my carbs under 20g a day.  I have reached my goal weight (yeah!) and now want to increase carbs a bit to maintain.  Will this change the way I feel?  I've heard the term ""fat adapted"" a lot on here....will I still have that?  I'm assuming I will go out of Ketosis, but losing weight was a benefit....just wondering how I can maintain my weight while still reaping the benefits without the continued weight loss."
keto,Keto doesn’t work for me anymore.,"Hey everyone, 

In 10 days it will mark my 6 month anniversary of me starting keto. Since then I’ve learned a lot and tried a lot. When I started keto in the first few weeks like everyone I dropped a decent amount of weight (14 pounds) and was very happy. Then after doing keto for around 2 months and rarely exercising I dropped almost 30 pounds total. 

But in the last 4 months I have barley lost any weight (5 pounds total). I haven’t changed anything that I was doing in the beginning. If anything I’ve made my diet better but I’m still not losing weight. I checked if I had ketones in my body today and the thing came back as negative. Even though I haven’t done anything that would be a reason why my body isn’t in ketosis. 

My diet nowadays consists of foods like almonds, cheese, mixed berries, bulletproof coffee, stevia, half and half, eggs, vegetables, chicken and beef. 

I’ve done my macros, I count calories, I count carbs, I don’t eat any sugar but I still don’t lose weight anymore and I don’t know what to do. 

If anyone has any suggestions on what I can do to lose weight please let me know. 

Thanks and have a good day."
keto,Should I track alcoholic spirits along with all my macros?,"I am one of those impatient 40-somethings who lost a ton of weight on a low-carb diet 20 years ago, and is not struggling to see significant loss on Keto. I've been weighing my food and tracking everything I put in my mouth. When I track everything I eat and drink, I am well within and often 20% under my caloric and carbohydrate goals for my macros. However, if I drink any alcohol (spirits only: Vodka, Gin, etc.), that stuff is so calorically dense, if I tracked those calories as well... I'd shoot past my caloric goal for the day after a couple of sips. 

Now, I've heard from multiple resources that ethanol is so taxing on the system to dismantle and digest that it actually requires more calories to process than it contains. I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe once a week at the most, and when I do, it it always Gin and Diet Tonic, or I sip on Scotch and soda. So, I'm not talking about the calories in beer or sugary cocktails. I am only talking about the huge number of calories in spirits. Do you guys count them in with your macros for the day?"
keto,Sucralose - yay or nay?,"Hi, guys. First day on Keto. Earlier I had a conversation with a friend and we started talking about the sweetener in my ketoade. I'm using a sucralose Bulk Powder carb &amp; sugar free sweetener, strawberry flavoured - the Liquiflav drops. 

This person started being very aggressive towards me because I said I'm using sucralose. What's wrong with it?! 

I know that the powder ones have maltodextrine and dextrose as fillers, but not this one - this one is liquid, 0 carbs, 0 sugars, no nasties. Does it still raise insulin, or what's wrong with it? Thanks!"
keto,Solve the electrolyte riddle,"Ever since going keto/low carb I feel my electrolytes were messed up, but I still can't figure out how to properly correct them. Since you guys are electrolyte experts by default maybe you could figure this out. What would you say based on these symptoms and reactions to each supplements? I've tried to supplement and add foods in many different ways and nothing seems effective so far.

Overall symptoms: Brain fog, effort to breathe (only on rare occasions I ""forget"" I'm breathing, low energy overall, threshold crampy legs.

Sodium: Makes me feel just with a little more energy and less lightheaded for a short amount of time. Taking more won't help much. Serum is always around the mid-lower healthy range.

Potassium: Instantly kills any anxiety and makes my breathing smooth, lowers cramps. The effects are very short lived and reverse into worsening symptoms in a pretty short time. Taking too much irritates stomach, increases brain fog and makes me  dizzy and weak. Serum is always around the upper healthy range.

Magnesium: This is a real riddle. Magnesium takes a while to buildup in the body so it would make a lot of sense to assume I'm depleted, after all I haven't been supplementing throughout the lowest carb periods. But I can't tolerate it at all. As little as 260mg-400mg a day will increase sleepiness(will make me sleepy the next day even if I take it at night), cramps (yeah, literally a short while after taking my muscle will threaten to cramp at the next contraction), diarrhea, and brain fog. Tried most forms (glycinate, malate, threonate), threonate is the only one that won't give me diarrhea, but same side effects. Serum is on the lower healthy range which could indicate subclinical hypomagnesemia but I can't tolerate it. Go figure....

Calcium: probably have been on a pretty low intake for a long time based on what I eat. Had a vit D deficiency a while ago, but was corrected through supplements and reached normal levels. Whenever I had a bunch of dairy or calcium rich foods I did not feel anything in particular. Serum is around the upper healthy range."
keto,Goal Achieved!,"I'm a long time lurker to the sub, and been watching people left and right hit there goals. My journey wasn't as great as most, I started off at 217 pounds and at 5'7"" that would put me in the overweight category.

I started keto as anew year's resolution for myself and as a bet to my fiancee that I could lose the weight (she loves me either way but wants me to be healthy). I took on the path of strict keto and with the help of the advice of many people in this sub I finally made it toy goal weight.

I AM 180 POUNDS NOW!

I haven't been this weight since I was a sophomore in college, I am 27 now. I never thought I'd shed the weight, I did keto once before like 3 years ago but quit because I was approaching the whole diet incorrectly. 

Now, for me, this isn't a diet this is a lifestyle and I plan to keep on it for as long as I live. In reality, keto isn't so hard and I am so glad I took the plunge.

Thank you all on this sub, and thank you keto!"
keto,MCT Oil?,"Bottom line up front: how much value do you place in MCT oil?  And how can I ensure that I'm getting a quality MCT oil if I buy one online?

About me: I'm still relatively new to keto; I began the day after Thanksgiving last year and have been going great (with one 3-day period two weeks ago where I allowed myself to have carbs before returning to form).  I have lost 30 lbs since Thanksgiving 2020 (due in part to both keto and IF, not really exercising much yet); however, before my brief carb overload, I realized I was plateauing and not really losing much anymore.

So I started to finally keep track of my nutrient counts (I mostly just avoided eating anything with carbs, testing to ensure I never fell out of ketosis) and I realized that there are days when I have trouble getting my fat intake where it should be.  Don't get me wrong, for the most part, I have been nearly spot-on with my macros (60/30/10) without actually focusing on hitting those numbers for months, which I was surprised by, but there are days where it gets out of whack.  (Usually those are the days where I have chicken breast for dinner, as the protein/fat ratio throws things off a bit).

I decided to finally look into MCT oil, but as with everything, I don't trust any company's claims of being great.  I've seen far too much bullsh\*t... I usually go to Labdoor to check for their rating on supplements, but they don't seem to have MCT ratings.

So I wanted to come to you to ask about your preferred MCT oil; just the basic, no frills, MCT oil that you use.  Because I know if I search online for something, I'll get 1,000 different product suggestions (with at least 50,000 usages of the term ""keto"" and 20,000 ""weight loss"" on the labels) and not have any clue which is worthwhile."
keto,Question for those that are FAT ADAPTED,"I am curious,  for those people that are fat adapted , when you do have an instance when you go over a bit on carbs and your body switches gears and burns carbs and then switches back do you gain a little weight in the short time? Do you get a little water retention?
It would be great to hear what it is like when your body can switch from being a fat burner to a carb burner and back to a fat burner."
keto,2021 progress,"[Progress](https://imgur.com/a/iArzuLX)

From January 5th to today I’ve lost 34.2 lbs. / 15.5 kg (5'5"", 235.2 lbs. to 201.1 lbs.). The picture shows January 9th vs. April 10th. 

In the summer of 2019 I’d gotten down to 174 lbs. from 230 lbs., then my life situation changed, then Covid happened (excuses excuses, but I succumbed to them). By January of this year I’d regained everything plus 5 lbs., and was back at a point where the weight was getting physically uncomfortable. About half of the initial weight loss was from keto, and I wanted to get back into it because not has it been the easiest and most comfortable way to stay in a calorie deficit, I generally feel amazing on it.

Especially this past fall I struggled with getting half heartedly into it again and again, only to go off it way too easy. This resulted in slower (but still...) weight gain and feeling kinda hopeless. During a particularly indulgent December, and my feet hurting a lot after work days (fairly active job), I started to prepare mentally for a different January. Seeing photos from New Years Eve was the cherry on top and I was looking forward to taking back control. 

It’s now been over 3 months back on keto, and I generally feel better than I did all of 2020. I know motivation is unreliable, but it’s still here in full force and I take advantage of it the best I can. I didn’t start out with any exercise goals beside collecting a bunch of steps on my Fitbit. Only very recently did I start c25k as I felt a genuine wish to sweat more. 

I try to stay at 20g carbs or under, allowing up to 25g if need be. The past 1.5 months I’ve incorporated IF and some 36 hr fasts and found that I absolutely love it, so that will definitely be a part of my journey going forward. This was not necessary for me to be successful with keto or weight loss at all, I was most interested in all the other benefits. Still, I didn’t expect it to suit my lifestyle as well as it has. I know I would never have bothered with this if I wasn’t already eating keto. 

Sorry for this little wall of text, I just wanted to contextualize and explain what I've been doing. I guess I felt like sharing because I just feel so *hopeful* these days, and keto plays a huge role in this."
keto,confused/frustrated by lack of progress!!!,"Hey folks, first time posting on Reddit in general so be gentle please lol

so, I've been doing keto very successfully for about 2 months now, and I'm quite proud to announce that I'm down almost 40 pounds so far! started at a little over 400 (i know, I've been a big boi) to about 365. height is 5'11 if that matters. My issue is this, my weight loss has definitely stalled despite hitting the gym regularly 3-5 times a week doing at least 20 minutes of cardio (heart rate is about 150 the entire time after a brief warm up) and strength training broken up by muscle groups each gym day. last time I did a weigh in I was 365 and this was about a week ago. The last few days I got curious and checked again and each day tends to fluctuate from around 361 to 373! I'm really not sure what I'm doing wrong here.

&amp;#x200B;

Been doing high protein Keto OMAD since the beginning and that is also when I started working out. macros are protein 140 carbs 20 fat 180 but the only one I consistently hit is protein, I treat everything else as a limit. Calories are below 1800 which is a pretty drastic deficit for a man of my size, but I generally feel fine and have enough energy to make it through the day to day and hit the gym still."
keto,Help!,I've been doing Keto for about 3 months and have only lost about 15 pounds! I thought I would have lost a lot more weight by now. Idk what I'm doing wrong. I stay under 20g of carbs a day EVERYDAY! I started at 210 in January and I'm now at 195. I'm losing hope y'all. I know some weight loss is better than none but I'm still so far from my goal weight of 135. I figured I'd be at least halfway there by now. I'm really bummed. Any advise please!
keto,Help and tips with continues weight loss on Keto!,"Hello everyone! 

At the end of Last year, i decided to start Keto again and lose weight.  It has been going well thus far, but i believe progress is relatively slow, and i think i might be doing something wrong somewhere.  So, i am here looking for advice into what i can do to improve the situation! :D

&amp;#x200B;

My start point and end point are as follows:

Sepetember 2020: 124.5 Kg at 43.1 BMI

As of Today, April 17 2021: 99.4 Kg at 34.4 BMI

&amp;#x200B;

So, about 8 months to lose 25.1 Kg.  

&amp;#x200B;

While i am happy i lost weight at all, i think this might be too slow.  I am aware my body could just be a slower model lol, but i am hoping some of you fine individuals could help me improve this \^\_\^

I am going for the following macros ideally:

5% Carbs

25% Protein

70% Fat

1500 Calories

&amp;#x200B;

Usually, i stay just under the macros, but sometimes i exceed a bit depending on meal.  But i have did my best to adhere to this as best as possible.  My main issue is staying under the CALORIE limit to reach my fat goal.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, i have rambled on long enough!  Any insight into how i could improve would be amazing!

Thank you in advice, and i hope you all have a pleasant day :D"

keto,Keto for vegetarians?,"Hi everyone. This is probable the 3rd time I am trying keto, albeit this time I am starting it with a 5 day extended fast followed by alternate day fasting (36 hours). 

Now the reason I discontinued keto last 2 times was largely because of my inability to have meat (chicken, lamb) on a daily basis. I also got an allergy test done and figured I am allergic to eggs. So the only options for me to do a pure keto is either to have salads everyday or meats every meal which is something too hard for me to continue in the long term. 

I am wondering if someone can guide me on a keto plan for vegetarians. Also, if I follow the 36 hour fasting protocol properly, is it fine to have lentils (50g carbs 20g protein) adding butter to it with some whole wheat bread, once or twice a week?

Any guidance on vegetarian keto recipies would be great to. 

Thanks for your help. :)"
keto,Carbs after workouts?,"So heard that I can eat basically anything after a hard workout. The idea is that my body is screaming for energy so carbs get gobbled up fast.

3 - Cardio or weights or either? 
4 - Has anyone ever actually worked this into their diet? I'd love to hear about your experience!

keto,Weight loss slowing down as I get closer to my goal/normal weight,"Hey everyone! I guess I’m looking for others out there that may be similar to me.

I (f24) am 156cm tall (or short haha) my starting weight was 65.6kg which was the heaviest I’ve ever been, I’m currently 3 months in and I have lost 6.3kgs. I don’t do any other exercise apart from walking my dog. Some days I eat only once, sometimes twice! I just eat when I feel hungry. My weight has been very stubborn my whole life, I’ve never been one to lose weight easily. 

I am super stoked that I’ve lost 6.3kgs so far!! 

It took me about 20 days to lose the most recent kg. I’ve heard that when you start getting close to your normal weight the weight loss starts slowing down! My goal weight is 55kg so I still have another 4 to go. Overall the weight loss has been a bit slower for me.

Did anyone else have a similar thing happen to them when they were getting close to their goal weight? 

Does anyone have any tips to speed up the process a bit? Should I start exercising more maybe? I keep my carbs under 20g everyday and eat no more that 1200 calories."
keto,Maximizing protein absorption,"I am getting enough protein to meet my fitness goals and maintain my weight, but is it important to try and maximize the absorption of the protein I am eating?

Does creating an acidic environment in your gut by eating say a salad with a vinaigrette dressing before eating a meal protein maximize absorption?"

I have a cocktail of lemon juice, ACV, and Cayenne Pepper each morning. I care 0% about taste and am strictly interested in health benefits.

With that said, are there any other spices/whatever else that I should consider adding to this morning drink? Note that I fast until 12n/1p every day so I must limit calories. Also note, I’m not trying to cut weight - just trying to be as healthy as possible.

As one potential suggestion - Is adding coconut oil to a drink uncooked a good idea? I have a container of unrefined coconut oil I use strictly for cooking and can scrape some out to mix it into the cup and it’s something I’ve thought to do to help with ketosis but haven’t implemented quite yet."

keto,"My new digital bathroom scale tells me all sorts of interesting into. I've been doing keto for 9 weeks now and it says I've lost 9 lbs exactly, and 2.9 lbs of that was fat.","Just to be clear, I have been doing keto for 9 weeks now, and I started using this scale one month after starting.  So the numbers and data it is registering is for the last 5 weeks only.  (In total, I have lost 17 lbs since starting keto on Feb 10, 2021).

I wish I'd had this scale from the beginning.  It's really great, and tells me all kinds of info.  How many pounds of water is in me, how much muscle, how much subcutaneous fat, what my BMI is, etc.  Today I finally noticed something else, and that was that it is telling me how many pounds of FAT I've lost since I started using the scale.  It came to 2.9 lbs.  Of fat.  Gone.  Used up!  

My mom told me today I have strong keto breath.  I've been eating a lot of meats, (steaks! yum!), cheese, eggs, (God, so many eggssssss!), above ground veggies and pork rinds coated in butter, coconut oil, and natural peanut butter, nuts, and avocados.  I'm not watching my macros, because it's too difficult for me, and I'm trying to keep my calories under 1200 a day--  and I think I'm doing that, because most days I only eat one meal maybe two.  I've been doing IF without realizing it, so I know I'm doing this well.  I have not 'cheated' once since starting this.  I've got to lose weight for two foot surgeries, so I am SERIOUS.

Does it sounds correct to you guys, that out of 9 lbs, nearly 3 of those were fat?  I try to get on this scale every day, first thing in the morning. The more you use it, the more info it saves and adjusts and tells you.  It's pretty darn cool.  I didn't notice the info about the fat until today, because I'm legally blind, and it's really hard to see my iPhone and all of the data it is gathering. 

So--  thoughts?  If this scale is correct, it's saying 1/3 of the weight I've lost is actual fat.  Should the percentage be higher?  What is the other 2/3 made of?  Oh, ALSO!-- I have been lifting two 8 gallon milk jugs every day now for three solid weeks, trying to build up some strength in my arms.  Five arm exercises, and 3 types of squats.  The amount of muscle the scale says I'm creating is very low, just a tiny %, but I'm trying!  I keep going...."
keto,Is it bad that I'm eating a half pound of cheese burger (sans bun ofc) like every day?,"I feel like I already know the answer, since it lands in my macros. But...I have to ask anyway. For dinner the past week I have been cooking up about a half pound of (80/20) beef and adding cheese. I'm not going over macros and am pretty much meeting my protein macro every day, but still. It feels so wrong, haha.

Does anyone else eat ground beef like all the time? I feel like I could do it for a while because it's cheap, easy, keeps me full and I have the spices just right that it tastes really good."
keto,The keto plan I gave my sister,"So many people have messaged me or asked on my earlier post what I told her when she asked me how I'd lost the weight and I told her about keto I thought I'd post it here. As always, I urge you to read this sub's FAQ. It's been my rock and I'm not even exaggerating.

I basically summarized the FAQ plus my own little interventions:

* Try to keep your carbs under 20 a day but if you do go over, don't let it derail you, just keep them as low as you can for the rest of the day.
* Lean into protein. Make sure you're getting at least 100 grams a day even if you need to go over your deficit calories to get there.
* Drink ketoade and use salt on your food. (I gave her the FAQ recipe)
* Weigh and track your food as much as you can. Again, if you can't, don't let it derail you. Do your best and keep going. 
* Use a food tracker all the time, every day. If you stop, start again when you can. (She uses CarbManager, I did, but now use Cronometer.)
* If there is something you really want and will feel deprived and resentful without it, make sure you're already full (if you can) and have one bite of the thing. Count it as 5 carbs (it probably won't be that much) and then get rid of the rest. The first bite is always the best anyway.
* Be kind to yourself. This is not a punishment. It's not that you ""can't have carbs,"" it's that you don't want them. 
* If you stop eating keto you're not cheating. You're just not eating keto. It will be there when you're ready to come back to it. 

That's pretty much it. When she's had questions I've answered them. She told me she's gone off keto sometimes, but always gotten back on with the next meal. 

Keto On everyone!"
keto,Feeling kinda down,"So im on keto and IF , which when no ones around i can do it easily.

keto,Can someone recommend me breakfast?! I don’t know what to eat.,I don’t eat beef or pork but everything else is fair game! I don’t have a waffle maker either lol. I usually eat my meals in the morning. So anything goes!! I’ll also pair it w veg to get nutrients in.
keto,[Help] Potassium sources: supplement or food items,"I'm looking for foods with good sources of potassium. I'm about to go back on keto after having massive success with it. However, when I went for a blood test my doctor was concerned with my level of potassium and I was having heart flutters from the lack of potassium. So I'm looking to avoid that this time around. 

I take a full electrolyte tablet twice a day from a endurance supplement company, I also started to use the mio sports drink mix that's sugar free but has potassium and salt, sugar free gatorade after workouts, and I also drink mineral water every once in a awhile. I know foods like avocado have good sources, but I can't just eat 4 avocados a day lol. My diet consisted roughly around 70% veggies, 15% meats, 15% fat sources(dary, multiple low carb nuts. I did incorporate 4 blackberries per day for extra vitamin C and potassium with out ingesting to many carbs. Normally, I'd just take a potassium supplement but they're limited behind the counter at the pharmacist because you can OD on them super easy and give yourself a heart attack, which is also why vitamin pills don't have potassium at least in Canada. 

Do you guys have any suggestions or perhaps a list of foods?"
keto,Losing too much weight. High calorie suggestions?,"42m. I’ve been doing keto/low carb for almost a year. I also do intermittent fasting. Usually 2 meals a day roughly 5 hours apart. I’ve lost what I consider a little too much weight. I’m around 7% body fat or so, maybe less.

Sometimes I’ll add a third meal, but I’d like to continue to do keto as well as intermittent fasting, 2 meals. 

Any suggestions for an easily consumable, CLEAN, high fat food I can eat a lot of? Thanks!"
keto,IF and Keto? Advice appreciated.,"Stats: 32F - SW 166 (post baby I got stuck here since 3months PP) - GW 125 - height 5ft1

So back on Jan 4th I started keto and introduced IF after about 2 weeks. All went well til about 6 weeks ago. I got a stead 1-2 lbs a week after the initial big drop of about 8lbs in 1 week. I was doing 16:8 and then 36h before a cheat day. I got stuck about 4-6 weeks ago at 151-153. It fluctuated between those and nothing helped. 

About 4 weeks ago I got into a stressful situation between buying a house, work, and I ended up getting tonsilitis. I didn’t really keto but kinda did IF and generally did OMAD which didn’t bother me really, for a few days at a time but no schedule on it. 

I started easing back into things about 2 days ago doing the OMAD and keto since yesterday. And this morning, I broke the 150 (148.8!) which seems weird. 

I wonder is keto even worth the extra hassle? Am I better doing IF only but keep it reasonable for that meal?

Does anyone have advice or feedback on this?

I do exercise, as much as I can and like to go for walks 3-4 times a week of either 4 or 7.8km."
keto,Fasting vs low calorie day,"Hi, so I am at a small deficit ( about 600 cal a day). I need to loose 40 pounds and at this rate it’s very slow. I want to speed up my weight loss by introducing a day of fasting ounce a week. I’ve done many 3day and 2day fasts before but I am sick of doing those. Lol I don’t even want to do one full day. So do you think it’s ok for me to fast all day and then eat a 200 cal salad an hour or two before bed so I can sleep better. It’s rly hard for be to sleep while fasting. I am doing this day or fasting to increase my calorie deficit more so than I am for autophagy.  Opinions ?"
keto,Cholesterol got worse,"So started keto about 3 months ago, lost 15lbs, yay. Last year I was a mess and ate crap, got told to loose weight and eat better. Recently got my annual checkup back and my cholesterol is even higher. I eat a lot of cheese and heavy cream in coffee. Do I need to stop with keto all together? (dunno why there's no data from last year on some of these lines)

keto,Is the Keto Diet Right for You?,"Although the conversation about the Ketogenic diet is widespread, many people still find it challenging to tell what is fact or fiction. In this article, you will gain insights into the myths and facts surrounding the Ketogenic diet.

**What Is Exactly Is a Keto Diet?**

The Keto diet works on the principle that by depleting carbohydrates, you will burn fat for fuel, hence maximizing weight loss. It entails a gradual reduction of carbs intake and replacing it with fats.

**Keto Diet Myths/Facts**

Here are the common Keto diet myths and facts.

**Myth 1:** You Can Consume Any Fat

**Fact:** When practicing Ketogenic, people consume healthy fats. If you want to keep fit, avoid saturated fats, and focus on organic foods rich in fiber. To prevent any stomach discomfort, space out the quantity of your daily fat intake.

**Myth 2**: Weight Loss is the Only Benefit of Keto Diet

Fact: Contrary to what many believe, the Keto diet has immense benefits other than weight loss. For instance, it enhances cognitive function, boosts gut health, regulates body hormones, and stabilizes blood sugar levels.

**Myth 3:** You Don't Need to Exercise

Fact: Exercising is highly recommended when you are on a Keto diet. However, to achieve more out of workouts, ensure you eat adequately, and allow enough time for recovery. To exercise, you may need more carbs, and it is essential to up your carb consumption on workout days.

**Myth 4:** Your Muscle Mass Will Reduce

Fact: As opposed to the myth, people who follow the diet while doing strength exercises gain muscles.

**Myth 4:** It Is Characterized By Fatigue

**Fact:** During the adjustment period of the diet, you may feel tired, but that condition will diminish with time. More importantly, not everyone experiences fatigue during dieting. However, if you encounter it, bear in mind that it won't last beyond a week.

**Myth 5:** The Diet is for a Short Period

Fact: The duration of the diet intake depends on your health and fitness goals. In most cases, the standard period is between three to five months. After this phase, you may revert to your regular eating patterns for some weeks.

**Myth 6:** There is no Science behind the Diet

Facts: Several scientific studies support the Ketogenic diet. For instance, particular research shows that the diet was initially created to help epileptic patients regulate seizures. Additionally, the diet helps reduce or maintain body weight.

**Myth 7:** Rich in a Lot of Fats and Proteins

**Fact:** The diet doesn't contain high fats and proteins. Depending on one's training goals, the macronutrient is apportioned based on individual requirements. For example, the typical macronutrient split for this diet includes low carbs, high fat, and moderate protein.

**Myth 8:** Causes Heart Attack

**Fact:** Keto diet encompasses the intake of saturated fats, which doesn't cause a heart attack.

**Final Thoughts**

This diet can help you improve your fitness and health goals. If you want to succeed from the diet, it is vital to scrutinize the myths surrounding the diet and adopt evidence-based facts."
keto,Summer is coming! Whatcha drinking?,"Through the winter I enjoyed a glass of pinot noise here and there. Rum with Pepsi zero (ug the aspartame feels though), and recently I found Truly. Pre keto I was a beer gal but even the low carb ones make me feel so gross these days. I'm looking for an easy drinking, not too sweet, summer bevy for weekends at the lake. Please share your favs below! I'm in Canada and I'm not scared of mixing up my own cocktails. Guessing we don't have the same access to premixed drinks as the states."
keto,Feel Dizzy before and after keto.,I always have fatigue and a slight dizzy and sleepy feeling and had it for a long time(before and during keto).

My haemoglobin was 14.1 a couple of weeks back. What can I do about it.
keto,fat adaptation question - glucose levels management,"Fat-adapted ketoers and their energy source management (aka glucose management)

Hello! I came here to get some clarification and confirmation of my understating of energy source management.

Say, *a carb-burner* decides to go keto. Carb-burner's primary source of fuel is carbs (aka glycogen). Once carbs (glycogen) is depleted from muscles and liver reserves, his body will start switching to fat-burning. Once he went through 100 rounds of hell of keto flu, his body is learning to adapt to using fat for energy (on the condition that carb-burner stops eating carbs). 

And we have *a fat-burner* \- a fat-adapted person, ketoing for months. A fat-burner's primary source of fuel is fat.  (Although he relies on fat mostly throughout the day/night to give him energy, after he ate, he will still have a glucose spike. Depending on food he ate, the spike will either be steep up and steep down (if he ate a bagel for e.g.) or the spike will be more like a hill (if he ate 3 eggs for e.g.). But he will still have an increase in glucose levels-&gt; meaning that this glucose will go into muscles and liver --&gt; **meaning that he will be relying on glucose for some time after food intake**. 

HERE COMES THE QUESTION(S) --&gt;) 

Now, about this last bit of the sequence - as his glucose goes up, his ketones go down. **(1)** Does this mean that he switches to using glycogen as the energy source until his glucose goes down/ketones go up? OR he keeps using fat as the energy source and carbs that he ate will go into reserves. **(2)** Is there a ""max capacity"" of glucose reserves? If his reserves are full (from previous food intake e.g.), what happens with the carbs he ate during the meal?

So, I'm my understanding, being fat-adapted effectively means managing your glucose levels. After you ate, you restore glycogen and use it as fuel until next meal. After few hours your glucose goes down/ketones go up and you start using fat for fuel, then you eat again and this circle goes on until you go to sleep. Effectively, following the above piece, you actually have a prolonged period of burning fat **only** after your last meal (e.g. dinner). When you practice Intermittent Fasting (IF) (with a lunch &amp; dinner regimen), you will use fat for fuel only during the night and until your lunch next day. Question number **(3)** \- does this mean that if you do **not** follow intermittent fasting and consume something 3-5 times a day (doesn't have to be full meals but something that breaks your fast), you effectively always use glycogen as fuel rather than fat because your glucose goes up and down and you do not give your ketones a chance to ""override"" glucose? Following the above - an IF is a must on keto because otherwise you just do not use fat for fuel other than at night. Here is where I am struggling to understand fat-adaptation. 

To the title of this post - is fat-adaption all about glucose management as written above? 

I hope its clear what I mean and would appreciate your takeaway on the glucose management situation :) 


Cheers and stay safe :)"
keto,NSV in a hug.,"I have been eating keto for the last three years. My initial weight loss was 70lbs. I have plateaued for about 2years. That is a success in and of itself as I have yo-yoed my entire life. 3 weeks ago I changed up my diet. The result is 18 pounds lost in 3 weeks. 
Today a friend stopped by my office today and gave me a hug. She commented that there is a lot less of me to hug! That's a great compliment!"
keto,Electrolyte ratio being off made me very irritable and hungry on keto,"I have been having such a hard time with my electrolytes on keto. I first tried just pink salt and Lite Salt. Not enough. Then I started buying electrolyte powders in all varieties. Not enough. It wasn't until I did electrolyte powder with some salt, a little salt on top of that, and changed my magnesium to mag citrate did I finally start feeling the magical fullness and didn't feel like my anxiety was raging at the end of the day. 

I don't know what it was. I read the FAQ and assumed I could get enough dietary mag and salt that I would be okay, but I was WRONG. 

Point of the story is if you are still not feeling 100% on keto, keep trying and testing, troubleshoot with this community, and keep at it. I am so glad I stayed curious about what was going on..."
keto,Longtime keto experiences asked for,"I have been on and off keto for two years because of personal challenges and having to having enough determination to go for long time.  So now I am ten days without and hiccups and I found constantly weighing my self was one stressor that I could eliminate by weighing only weekly at the most and delaying weighing until I could not ignore it anymore.

Another stressor was waiting until I was hungry to decide what to eat and that would end up with me eating nonketo because it was the easy way out.

Another stressor was trying to keep to 20 carbs total.  I was eating only 900 to 1000 without bulletproof coffee and was getting dizzy.  Was following a group that stated that was the way to go and poo pooed anyone who argued.

Tried to replace sugar addiction with keto treats and just made it worse.

So far, after identifying the stressors, I am doing great.  But I am curious how some of the long haulers have overcome their stressors and how long they have they have been maintaining keto.  For health reasons, I will be on this forever so I would like to know future stressors."
keto,I didn’t relapse,"I’m in absolute awe of myself. 

Firstly let me say, I call it relapsing because as a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, I know when I want something vs when I’m clucking for it. I’m a year and two weeks sober, and in replacement of the sauce and sparkle I used food. I’m now 5’7 and 92kg. Long and short, the floor boards squeak. 

I have been on keto for two weeks. I’ve logged my food, I’ve nailed my cooking and I have absolutely bloody loved it. Yoga everyday, walk everyday, building up little by little to the healthiest me. 

But today I had a vision of getting a massive cake with icing (I saw it on TV - the type of cake you want to buy a drink and lick all over) and I wanted to stick a fork in it and eat it until I felt sick and bin the rest. I don’t even like cake. It was never my thing but I had that addict twinge. I knew sugar was going to be tough to ditch but after you’ve given up cocaine and champagne, sugar was the lesser of two evils... so I thought.

I realised recently if I kept giving in to sugar, pretty soon I was going to give in to alcohol again. If I can’t acknowledge and address these addict ticks that set me off and cut them off, I’m going to relapse. 

So I turned back around. I stopped walking to my local bakery, turned around and came back home. Made an enormous cup of camomile tea and meditated. 

I found a higher power somewhere along the way today. I am grateful to be a part of this community and I am so grateful I have a safe space to share my small triumph. 

God bless x"
keto,NSV Double Time,"Started out at 226 a month ago, and I can now say that I am down to 209! 

I wanted to lose 20 this month, but I had to remind myself 17 is a great victory and the lowest I've been in years.

The second part is more so just low carb related, but I noticed that my rosacea hasn't been acting up as much. 

Like it was normal a few weeks ago, and then it slowly became only when I drank or laughed way too much, and now I only see a little pink/red even when I had my mask on all through work.

So now I'm thinking that my rosacea isn't as hereditary as I thought, and more so what I was consuming! So yay to not feeling super insecure about my face!"

So I've jumped back into keto after a work trip and i decided to try x50 green tea + resveratrol as a drink to have throughout the day.  Something to give me an energy boost, taste nice and hey it even says it can aid with weight loss....

Looked at the nutrition info and it said 1.4g of carbs per serving with 0g sugar so i was like sweet we're on.  Been having it for 3 or so days now and I'm liking it.  Did some googling and it has maltodextrin in it,  google says this might impact my keto in a negative way.... does anyone know more about this?

I always hit my protein, I hit or {mostly} stay under fat, I’m always under carbs and am usually at or under calories. I work out 5 days per week (mix of cardio/strength training) and take weekends off (usually active recovery days by taking my kids for a 30-40 minute trail walk).  
I drink approximately 100 oz of water per day.

It just wasn’t this difficult when I did it the first time. Everything melted off. I know my hormones might still be in play. My youngest was 2 when I did this a couple years ago and now I still have a baby and trying again. Our sleep is decent. We have rough nights here and there but the average night is good. I’m not the best sleeper but it could be much worse.

keto,Keto Diet Plan for Weight Loss,"The whole world is now combating a common problem of human life called [obesity](https://www.fitex.club/some-unknown-things-about-weight-loss-you-should-know/). Almost every person in this world is concerned about the extra weight of their body. Thus they are trying their level best to get rid of the extra pounds and they are adopting several ways to reach their target. Some are taking the route of hard exercising, some are going through [yoga](https://www.fitex.club/embrace-your-body-with-3-yoga-poses/). But there is another way through which you can get rid of the extra fats of your body. Here you need to adjust your diet plan a bit and increase the intake of protein food by reducing the carbohydrates. During this diet plan, you will be given a very little amount of carbohydrates and the same will be replaced by fat and protein. Since you are reducing the carbohydrate intake in your body, it will get to a metabolic state which is named Ketosis.

**What Is a** [**Keto Diet**](https://www.fitex.club/what-are-the-dangers-of-the-keto-diet/)**?**

A question may arise about what is a Keto diet. Normally a person takes 50 to 60% of the carbohydrates of his daily meal. But in the case of the Keto diet, you cannot consume that much carbohydrate. As carbohydrate is the main source of energy of our body, it protects the fat content to generate energy in the body. While you reduce the consumption of carbohydrates drastically, the body breaks down the fat cells to make the necessary energy for its physical and physiological works. During the Keto diet, you can only take 30 to 50 grams of carbohydrates so that the blood [sugar](https://www.fitex.club/unhealthy-fat-deposits-around-heart-from-too-much-sugar/) level does not fall and you don’t get sick. The required energy of the body will be generated by oxidizing the fat cell and it will cause you to shred the excess amount of fat in your body. In a Keto diet plan, almost 50% of the meal contains protein and the rest are made of fat and the least amount of carbs. People who want to shred their extra pounds quickly and effectively can adopt this diet plan. Basically, a Keto diet plan is for a month after that you will have to take a short break of nearly one week and then again you can go for the second phase of your Keto diet plan.

A Ketogenic diet is basically a form of diet that does not have the responsibility to give you proper health. It is only used to lose weight early. People who are suffering from cardiac problems, certain brain diseases, and have problems with acne are advised to stay away from this kind of diet. Since the heavy fat content can increase the problems as well. Though this diet is all about reducing the intake of carbohydrates it eventually increases the intake of fat through different foods like butter, oil, and cheese. This is why you require taking proper advice from your doctor as well as a diet expert on whether you can go for this diet plan or not. Without knowing the proper ways of adapting to this diet plan can cause you heavy harm. Eventually, there are some side effects of this diet, and people who are capable of tolerating these things can go for or other specific kinds of diet plans.

**Preparation Before You Start a Keto Diet**

Changing to a different type of diet system requires some preparation of the body. You can’t switch over to a different kind of food plan suddenly as the body requires getting adapted with it. First of all, you need to start with the basics of the Keto diet. It may cause you some uncomfortable moments first up but slowly and gradually it will get adjusted. Since the Keto diet is targeted to reduce the carb intake in your daily meal, there will be less than 30 grams of carbs daily in your diet. The lack of carbs will be fulfilled by the intake of fats. As carbs are the sources of energy for the physiological and physical functions of the body, you require some substitute to cover the lack. Fat is a very good source of energy in the body and in absence of carbs, it will oxidize to generate energy in your body. So your meals should be filled with meat, cheese, nuts, oilseeds, eggs, and other sources of fats. The same amount of fat gives double energy than that of carbs and thus you need to put some low-calorie vegetables in your daily meal.

During the Keto diet, you should keep some important aspects of it in mind. You will not get that much low-carb food here and there and thus you need to carry your snacks wherever you are going. It will cause you a sense of unfulfillment many a time after you eat meals as carbs help to secrete the hormone that gives you the signal that you are done with your food. Taking too much protein diet will definitely cause you some change in the chemical as well as fluid balance in your body. It will also affect the balance of minerals in your body too. There you may have to take enough salt as well as electrolytes from outside too to keep your body hydrated. If you want your Keto diet to work faster, then you can use some Keto salt supplements too. There may be several obstacles in your road to [weight loss](https://www.fitex.club/healthy-weight-loss-diet-within-budget/) through the Keto diet, but you need to stay focused and not lose hope.

**Things That You Can Take during Your Keto Diet**

Since you are not taking carbs in ample amounts, you need to take such foods that will keep you filled. Without a proper amount of food you may feel starving as well as due to lack of satisfaction after eating, you may have mood swings as well. So here are some of the best foods that you can eat during your Keto diet.

**1. Meat**

Meat is a very good source of protein. It will help you to build your muscles and shred extra fats in your body. There are varieties of meat that are available in the market. Most people who are on the journey of weight loss try to avoid red meat like mutton, beef, pork, and so on. But here in the Keto diet, you can easily go for all kinds of meats. In other weight-loss diets, the experts recommend only boiled meat so that no extra oil can get in. but in this case, you can go for your favorite dishes made of chicken or mutton or beef and no one is going to stop you since along with protein, you also need ample amounts of fat too.

**2. Fish**

Sea fishes can be very good sources of high protein and essential fatty acids. They are actually very tasty and are very good for heart health. On the other hand, it will provide the necessary amount of protein as well as fat content required for the Keto diet plan. Salmon, tuna, mackerel, trout can be very good options for those who are going through their Keto diet plan.

**3. Dairy Products**

Milk and dairy products are very essential in this case of diet. Milk contains almost all kinds of micro-nutrients which are really necessary. It also will give you some amount of carbs along with fat too. Other than that, cheese, butter, and creams can be beneficial for the person going through the Keto diet.

**4. Nuts and Oilseeds**

These are very important parts of the Keto diet since they contain essential fat contents for your health. Almonds, walnuts, cashew, peanut along with flaxseed, pumpkin seeds are very healthy ingredients in Keto diets. You can take them through your meal as they will provide you the necessary amount of good fats to keep your internal organs healthy.

**5. Vegetables**

Filled with vitamins and minerals, vegetables are very much needed for those who are going through the Keto diet. Vegetables will keep your stomach full and the dietary fibers present in them will definitely keep your stomach healthy. Vegetables of different colors will provide you different types of vitamins as well as minerals too. On the other hand, they will give you some amount of carbohydrates as well. If you are looking for some change of test of your mouth, then these veggies will definitely provide you with a different kind of test.

**Foods That You Should Avoid during the Keto Diet**

When you are going through a Keto diet you need to take proper food enriched in protein and fat but the only thing you should avoid is carbohydrates. Most of the snacks available in the market are full of carbohydrates. Though there are different types of carbohydrates, still the snacks are mostly made of simple carbs that get into the body and assimilate easily to release energy. This is why they get digested quickly and you feel hungry soon after you finish the snacks. Some of the foods that you should strictly avoid if you are going through your Keto diet plan are mentioned here.

The first thing that comes on the list is bread and bakery foods. Bread is one of the steady foods of our [daily life](https://www.fitex.club/this-is-how-you-can-incorporate-healthy-activities-into-your-daily-life/). It is a good source of carbohydrates that helps you to generate energy for all your works. This is why consuming bread and bakery products, diet crackers, cookies are strictly forbidden in the Keto diet plans. The second thing that should be avoided is sweet and sugary foods. Sweets are full of sugar and sugar is the finest form of carbs. This is why you need to avoid sugar and sweet foods very strictly. Sweetened beverages contain a high amount of sugar so you need to stay away from soda, different kinds of packaged fruit juices, sweetened tea, and soft drinks.

On the other hand Spaghetti, noodles, wheat, rice, cereals, potatoes, corn, peas, pumpkin, black beans, chickpeas, citrus fruits like oranges, grapes, pineapples, and most importantly alcoholic drinks should be avoided if you want to get your body fat free really. There are different kinds of fats too that you should not consume during your Keto diet like margarine, vegetable oils, and so on when you are taking protein as the major contributor to your meal you should definitely try to have fresh meat. Processed and packaged meat is very much unhealthy and will disturb your goal of losing weight.

So far we were discussing the foods that we should avoid during the Keto diet plan. But there are some foods that we can easily take. These foods contain healthy fat in good proportion and thus you can consume them to keep your body healthy. There are some supplements that you can take like exogenous Ketone supplements. This is nothing but some extra amount of Ketones that you provide to your body from outside. Medium-chain triglycerides give the Ketones a boost to keep your body healthy.

They are also beneficial in terms of losing weight, gaining energy for your daily works as well as they help in digestion also. There are some snack options too for the people who are going through the Keto diet. Almonds and cheese are very good sources of healthy fat for the body. Avocado with chicken salad, unsweetened coconut, nuts and seeds, half-boiled eggs, olives, and salami berries can be good snack options for you so that you don’t feel starved while you are traveling or you are out of your home for a longer period of time.

**Benefits of Keto Diet**

1. The lower the number of carbs in the diet, the lower the appetite will be. The experts say that sugary and carbohydrate foods increase the appetite. Hunger is the enemy of your diet plan and thus if you will go for a Keto diet, then you will feel less hungry.

2. While you will lower the number of carbs in your meal, it will cause drastic weight loss at the start of the diet plan. As we all know that carbs are the fuel of our body and thus while there is less supply of carbs in the body, it will use the fat to generate the energy for the physical or physiological works of the body. This will cause faster shredding of fats from the body.

3. Like in nature, in our body also, there are different types of fats available. There are different sites where the fats are stored. The risk of health is thus determined by the deposition of the fats inside the body. Mostly the fats deposited in the lower abdomen are very harmful. This fat is very rigid and thus is the reason for obesity. While you lower the number of carbs in your diet, you will notice that the fat stored in the lower abdomen is getting shredded very fast. The fat which is used to generate energy in absence of carbs is generally supplied from this portion of the body.

4. While you lower the amount of carb intake in your body, the triglyceride content of the blood falls. It is the fat molecules that move through the body along with the blood through the blood vessels. Thus it reduces the risk of different diseases and you can stay safe from the dangers of blockage of the blood vessels.

5. High-density lipoprotein is a very healthy fat content of the body. While you decrease the amount of carb intake, it gradually increases the HDL level in the body. It keeps the heart healthy and protects the other organs from danger.

6. As soon as you decrease your intake of carbs, it causes a lower level of sugar in your blood. Lower sugar level thus causes lowering the insulin levels. The Keto diet is thus very helpful for those who have blood sugar.

7. It also brings the blood pressure under control as increased carbohydrate is the cause of elevated blood pressure too."
keto,Net Carbs in UK,"Hi,

I think I have been counting my net carbs incorrectly. I have been logging all food intake into Fitbit, the below are my results from yesterday.

Calories - 1697 , Fat - 127.6 , Fiber - 12.4 , Carbs - 22.3 , Sodium - 505.9 (I am supplementing) , Protein - 110.7 

Composition - 5% Carbs, 69% Fat, 26% Protein

I am burning around 4000 calories a day, no specific workout routine but going for daily hour long brisk walks.

I am losing weight at a good pace, a bit concerned about losing muscle mass, but my main issue is that I have been subtracting Fiber from Carbs as you see above (yesterday was 9.9 Net Carbs) but I have some conflicting information that the nutrition labels in the UK are Net for the line that reads 'Total Carbs' - does anyone have any further information on this or can confirm its true? Should I not be subtracting Fiber from carbs on UK nutrition labels?"
keto,Am I doing this right? (many questions),"About a week ago I committed to keto, I've spent the past week kind of easing myself into the diet, so today was my first day actually tracking and calculating my macros. That said, I don't actually know if I'm doing it right. I've just been piecing together common keto foods that I like and trying to get within the percentages I've read about. 

So for my first tracked day, this is what I've got:

1183 calories, 22.5 grams carbs, 94.8 grams fats, 69.1 grams protein. Percentages are 7%, 70%, 23% respectively. 

Will this work? Am I supposed to be getting more calories?

Also, how do I go about getting the other vitamins and nutrients when most fruits and a lot of vegetables are too high in carbs? Is zero sugar Gatorade good enough for replenishing electrolytes, or is there a better source?"
keto,How long before my belly starts to shrink?,"M 43, I started keto on 28 Feb this year and have gone from 295lbs to 256lbs through very strict keto, OMAD and IF. At this point I am only eating 1 meal every 2 days with 0 carbs. I am very happy with the weight loss so far and I feel great, I'm sleeping well - all the things we know to expect from a ketogenic diet. 

The main reason I started on this journey was because I have a very large pot belly, from years of overindulging on carbs and beer, etc. So my goal is to get it to a normal, proportionate size, so that I can wear some nice clothes again and not be an embarrassment to my wife and kids. But, while I'm happy with the weight loss, my stomach does not seem to be shrinking at all. I am losing weight in my face, hands, feet and legs, but not where I most want to.

Has anyone else had this experience? Am I being a bit impatient? Does anyone have any tips for losing weight in this specific area?

P.S. Thanks to everyone for always posting their success stories. It really helps to read them on days when I am struggling to stick to my regime."
keto,project7 candy,"Can someone vouch for the keto nature of this candy? It boasts 3g net carbs and 60 calories per bag of the sour gummies worms I bought, and MAN they are good.

Allulose and Corn Fiber appear to be the main ingredients."
keto,Blood Glucose Levels,"Hey guys,

Im doing 2.5 months Keto right now and I love it.
I lost around 12 kilo’s right now and i am almost at my goal weight of 95 kilo (im 192 cm length).
I lost a lot of fatt and have more and more energy, no more brain fog.

Yesterday i did some glucose testing which hovers during the day between 89-93. This is all included with eating.

Now my fasting glucose after waking up was 101, which made me worried.
I read a lot about physiological insulin resistance, and i have a feeling this could be it.

Does anyone have an explanation for this? Otherwise i will do a checkup at the doctors.

Thanks guys!"
keto,What are the possible reasons for weight loss stalls?,"Hi guys,

So I’ve been tracking my calories and amount of carbs and apart from 2 days where I purposefully went over (in terms of carbs), this past month I’ve consistently stayed at around 1200 or less calories a day, at least on average. And 30g of carbs a day or less (this is what I’ve done when I did it before and had no issues).

In the past 1 week though I haven’t seen any change in weight at all, in fact if anything a slight increase. It’s a little disheartening as keto is obviously a lot of effort. Usually I would see a loss of weight almost daily, but I haven’t dropped anything since 8 days ago.

I know it’s only a single week but idk. I’m planning to workout soon which will hopefully help."
keto,Any changes in your Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease?,"I've been keto for about a year. Dropped 50lbs, kept it off. I eat a lot of healthy fat and saturated animal fats. Before I lost weight I had early stages of fatty liver disease.  I've seen bipolar studies on how keto affects liver health in long term.  I was looking to hear some anecdotal reports from my fellow keto peeps. I'm getting blood work done this month."

keto,Health question about Keto,"I have been back on Keto for almost 5 weeks and this isn't my first time doing it. So to make a long story short Sunday night I woke up due to pain in my foot, it continued to get worse the next day. So bad that in fact that it hurt to walk on. The pain was absolutely horrible. I started researching it and came to the conclusion that it might be gout. I finally couldn't take the pain anymore and went to urgent care and the doctor confirmed my suspicion, it's gout. So I did some research and found some conflicting information. One article said keto can cause it but only at first and that keto actually helps prevent it due to helping inflammation. Another article...  no mention of keto but other health factors. One says avacados are a cause but another it's high fat dairy. Almost all say high intake of meat(chicken, beef, pork), some seafood,  sugary drinks, and alcohol are a cause which blows my mind because I'm not eating high protein or high amounts of dairy. Has anyone dealt with this with keto before? Is it very common? I would love to know your thoughts on this"
keto,Keto cured my chronic cock-ache!!!,"My penis always used to have a constant (yet mild) achey feeling to it. This would interrupt my social life massively, as I would zone out mid conversation, distracted by the discomfort in my shaft.
During the 'keto flu' the ache spread to my balls as well. After I began adding sodium to my sea-water the pain completely went away!
Now I can finally hold eye contact with my cousin (the only person who talks to me) without being taken from the present moment.
God bless keto"
keto,Sustainable Keto (Life after reaching health goals),"I was thinking about the USNews’s poor ranking of the Keto diet, which in my opinion is written based ignorance rather than reality. However, I want to know what other long term keto dieters do in sustaining mode, and maybe give people starting on the diet encouragement to continue. Or is it actually difficult to sustain for the majority?

My own experience on sustaining:

After 2 years of strict keto and reaching my goal body fat and weight, I relaxed the protocol and would treat myself to ice cream (w/real sugar) almost daily (2 scoops &lt;20 g carbs) and do not restrict carbs on the weekends (however, carbs feel so filling now that I can only eat once a day on the weekends).

Blood tests show I’m still always in ketosis. Any weight gained from a weekend of carbs disappears by mid-week and I haven’t had dreams about eating carbs for the last 2 years. In fact, carbs make me feel so full so quickly that I tend to avoid any old carbs and only eat carbs I really love like ice cream and French fries.

&amp;#x200B;

Is USNews correct that Keto is unsustainable? What has caused you to stop this WOE, and did you gain all your weight back? Or is your long-term experience after reaching your goals similar to mine?"
keto,Can Anyone Validate These Claims Or Provide Insight?,"https://furthermore.equinox.com/articles/2019/04/keto-cheat-days. This article has kept me from going back on keto.

keto,"PSA: ""Bang Keto Coffee"" at 7-11 has sucralose, which causes insulin spike IOW not necessarily-ketotic","There's a 7-11 right next to our house and I stopped in while walking the dog this morning. A coffee can with the words ""KETO"" emblazoned across it caught my eye. The brand is Bang. I'm sure they are well-intentioned, creating a sweetened coffee product with almost zero net carbs and 20g protein. But the idea that just having ""zero net carbs"" is what puts people in ketosis is a very rudimentary understanding of ketosis. A lot of people who continue to drink sucralose (Splenda) or aspartame (Sweet n Low) products while on keto diet will often become frustrated that they are not in deep ketosis...insulin-spiking sweeteners are often the culprit. Sweeteners such as stevia and monkfruit do not cause an insulin spike, but they taste weird. IF you can tolerate them, that's great. Otherwise, try to just drink cold brews or straight coffee."
keto,Egg fast,"Has anyone tried it? 

Basically, you eat 6-8 eggs everyday, at your normal eating times, for 3-5 days to help you get into ketosis. 

So, I guess it's not just eggs. You can have cheese, heavy cream, butter, and condiments. I also read about some versions that added bacon, etc.

I did keto a couple of years ago and it worked. I lost about twenty pounds in two months. I've done it on and off since then, but I'm having a harder time with it now. 

I was wondering if this is a good way to jumpstart. It seems effective, but also hard."
keto,Thought on net carbs vs total carbs - which do you follow?,"First time I did keto years ago, I really focused on net carbs - subtracting fiber and sugar alcohols etc. I aimed for about 20 “net carbs” a day. 

Now I’m back on the wagon, following the Virta program (which I love). They want us under 30 total carbs, which I’m finding harder to stick to - I found some keto bread at Costco with 12 carbs, 12 fiber - so 0 net carbs? But I thought, one slice and I will go through almost half my days allowance! 

I’m curious how much credence people give to the “net carb” and if you feel it makes a difference to stick with total carbs regardless of fiber, etc?"
keto,This time it's.. different,"Been doin keto on and off for years now. When still being a Bachelor I basically kept binging on grilled meats with mayo, bacon &amp; eggs and maybe some fish from time to time.

This time it's a little different. I moved in with my girlfriend a few months ago, and due to covid I am in home office and she's at the office, so I am doing the cooking. She agreed on hoping onto the train with me, but she wasn't really a friend of all meat all mayo all day all month, so I had to mix things up... and it has been a glorious ride since! Avocados, Kale, Cellery (took me 26 years to find out that I love that shit), Spinach, Salad, Peas, and so on. I fucking love it! First of all, the variety of my keto foods went through the roof. Secondly, due to the greens I get much more fiber in, therefore I am not nearly shitting myself 24/7, and lastly, the greens seem to make my breath not as bad as it used to be on dirty keto. Furthermore I feel more well rounded this time, and it doesn't feel completely different from my normal diet.
Fyi: I use the eatthismuch.org app for my meal plans, really loving it.

keto,Sudden health benefits of keto,"I have a question for long-time ketoers. I know keto can be very helpful for type 2 diabetes and PCOS, but how about other benefits? 

Here's my story. I'm a 38 y.o. female, I ate strict keto last 4 month, lost around 18 lb, started to workout as I reached the upper limit of ""normal"" BMI.

keto,Mouth Sores from Erythritol and Tea,"I have been on the keto journey for around 4 years now, doing the roller coaster version (3 months on 2 weeks off). Since the beginning, I have been eating desserts with erythritol. Mostly Atkins desserts, and a few other brands. 

About 6 months ago, I started to drink decaffeinated tea in the mornings. About 3 months ago, I started drinking it after dinner as well. After eating my meal, which always included an erythritol laden dessert, and then drinking tea, the inside of my mouth would start breaking out in these ulcers/hives. They would literally be all over the inside of my mouth, and sometimes on my tongue. It took me a bit to understand what was actually causing it. It only happens if I drink tea after my meals. If I drink tea after my meal without having any erythritol, no reaction either. 

I also tried different kinds of decaffeinated teas, as I know some use chemicals in the process of decaffeination, but it seems not to matter what type I use, I still get the reaction.

Any ideas what could be causing this? Chemical reaction? Or just an allergy to the combination my body doesn't like? Thanks."
keto,Civilizations are built on Farming,"This is a question that has been rolling around in my mind, and frankly bothering me quite a bit. If you look at it historically, every great civilization in the world has been built on a grain. Yet we, who are having success with Keto, are not supposed to eat grain. (I got the idea about civilizations being built on grains from Jared Diamond, and his book Guns, Germs, and Steel, among his other works.)

Examples: The far eastern civilizations were built on rice, the Roman empire and the civilizations in the fertile crescent were built on wheat and barley; The mesoamerican civilizations, that is the Aztecs and the Mayans etc., were built on corn, and potatoes. It was grains, and the farmers that grew them, that allowed the civilizations to produce enough calories that they didn't have to be hunter-gatherers all the time, and could therefore build on their arts and sciences.

I've come to my own conclusion about why this is so, but I would like to hear from other folks on keto, your thoughts as to how grains and starches became such a miserable problem for many of us."

My GAWD..... heaven in a pork rind. 😋 I don't know exactly what the carb count is, and to be honest I don't care,  because whatever it is, I'm still going to be making this one regularly. I hope that you will like it if you try it... let me know any variation that you have tried and enjoyed!!!"

keto,How to deal with insatiable hunger panhs,"I have been doing keto for about a week now and I am for the most part enjoying it. I have more energy and feel more alert, and slightly lighter on my feet (though that may well just be placebo effect). However, I have one major problem, and that is with the hunger pangs.

I can deal with carb cravings, and wanting pizza or pasta or chips or what have you, but since I started keto I am always hungry (for anything, meat and veggies seem just as appealing as carbs). I can and will eat 4 chicken breasts with a half bag of sauteed spinach and a big hunk of cheese, and 20 minutes later still be hungry. I have been drinking plenty of water and minding my electrolytes, and easily meeting my macros. I am 5'8"" and 150 lbs, and have a decent appetite normally, but this is unbearable. No matter how much I eat I'm still hungry within a very short period of time. Is this normal? Can I expect it to go away soon? It's extremely unpleasant and makes it hard to sleep."
keto,Keto Documentaries removed from Netflix?,"I love watching documentaries, vegan/sugar/keto whatever. I like to be exposed to other arguments but ultimately make my own decisions, like most people I’m sure. That’s what inspired me to start keto. 

Anyways, I’ve felt like rewatching documentaries that talk about sugar/carbs and hflc diets like The Magic Pill and Fed Up, and Carb-Loaded but I can’t find any of them anymore! Just Cowspiracy and other vegan/food pyramid supporting documentaries. Has anyone else noticed this? wtf Netflix!"
keto,"To the people who did keto for migraine, how long did it take you to see improvement?","I'm a little over 4 weeks into medical keto with about a 1:1 fats to protein/carb ratio (15 carbs, 75-85 protein, 100+ fat), and so far have not noticed migraine improvement.

I'm carefully monitoring foods and electrolytes. I also monitor my ketones and glucose.

I'm not on keto for weightloss, and I know that this sub mostly uses it for weightloss instead of medically--but wondered if anyone out there could give me some insight since this sub is bigger than the medical keto one.

I know there is a time period it takes to get ""fat-adapted,"" and that may be the time when improvement starts, but I expected if it worked for me, I would have seen improvement sooner.
I don't think I'm fat adapted yet because I'm still very tired (yes my electrolytes and calories are good).

Is it still too soon to throw in the towel? Or did most of you see improvement before the 1 month mark?

My ketones fluctuate anywhere between 1.5 - 4+. If I use MCT oil, I usually can get it to the 4 range. I could possibly trial a 1:2 fats...

(Please only respond if you do keto for a medical reason.)"
keto,Keto supplements for energy when you just wanna smash some processed carbs and a coffee when you are feeling exhausted at work?,"I'm a business analyst and have just been put into a ""sink or swim"" secondment to see if I'm fit to progress to being a permanent senior. Work was already very taxing, and I workout most lunchtimes to try stay in shape - and actually I'm trying to put on a kilo or so of muscle so need to keep well fueled.

I did very strict keto a few years ago when life wasn't so challenging, and I found it easy. But the few times I've tried over the last year, the sheer bouts of exhaustion keep causing me to break after a few days and grab a load of carbs because it feels like there is no way I'm going to stay conscious or looking well for the arvo meetings if I don't.

I've been wondering if taking exogenous ketones in those periods would help? And:
if Yes - can you please make recommendations?
if No - is there any other advice you can suggest?

Thanks!"
keto,went a little high in carbs - will I be kicked out of ketosis?,"Hey there, 

Newbie here and lately I have been ravenous for fresh vegetables. Not refined carbs, not sugar - but veggie after veggie. I feel as though I can eat a bucket full. I'm thinking this craving is coming from a deficiency? Not sure. 

I'm monitoring my calories every day (aiming for 1200) and thinking perhaps I'm going too low while my body is being fat adapted and that could be it. I'm 5 11, female, 27 years old, CW: 174 GW: 150. My challenge I guess is that too much meat doesn't feel good for my body, and so trying to hit my calories with tofu and fish and only occasional servings of meat is tough. 

Well anyway today, I've gone up to 25 grams of carbs when my goal has been to stay under 18. The carbs themselves we're extra avocado, pepper and spinach. 

I know that all carbs function differently in the body, do you think I will be kicked out of ketosis from these veggie carbs? And what are these intense cravings? 

I'm loving keto for the weight loss but I don't know how much longer I can stay at under 18 grams of carbs per day if I can't enjoy more vegetables."
keto,Craving carbs post-workout,"Hey everyone! I'm not sure why this happens right after I exercise, I just crave the most processed carbohydrates SO BADLY!! I turn into an eating machine seriously and meal prepping is the only way I can curb it. I'm not fully keto just yet and was following a relatively low carbohydrate diet for many weeks, but recently I've started giving into my cravings and having bad carbs again. 


I'd like to know how to do better with this as going keto is something I'm heavily considering."
keto,Does this frustrate anyone else,After realizing that CICO is not a good diet and just makes no sense I try to explain to people that they are not being healthy by eating smaller portions things with sugary but they refuse to listen or do not believe me. It frustrates me because my family just consumes massive amounts of sugar but eat very small portions. I try to explain to my family that all they are really doing is spiking their insulin and just eating away at muscle instead of fat. Was wondering if anyone else got frustrated at this.
keto,Nutella Alternative,"Sadly I cannot post a photo of it here, but if anyone is a Nutella addict like me, Amazon has a ""Belgian Choco Hazel no sugar added"" spread for $10 that us 1 net carb per tablespoon, 100 calories, 1 gram of protein and 7 grams of fat."
keto,having a carb rich meal this weekend. special occasion. how to soften the blow if at all possible and how to get back into ketosis as fast as possible?,"a bit of background about me. im basically at maintenance now have lost most of the weight i want and am trying to gain some size now (on keto, as i love the diet both the way it makes me feel, and the food itself)

I train 5-6 times a week, quite intensely. 

usually am about 10-15 net carbs a day. 

This week ill be going to a place that is essentially unavoidable with carbs. its ok and ive made peace with it. but are there any tips to...i dunno, prevent the negatives of carbs going into the system :lol and secondly, if whats the best way to get back on track? just go back to my usual routine?

&amp;#x200B;

thanks in advance :)"
keto,is glucomannan powder keto-friendly in large amounts?,"I used to eat JFC shirataki noodles ([https://www.amazon.com/JFC-White-Shirataki-Noodles-7-0/dp/B002ES7NME](https://www.amazon.com/JFC-White-Shirataki-Noodles-7-0/dp/B002ES7NME)) which had at least 3 carbs per bag. 

Recently, I wanted to make my own shirataki noodles and bought Nutricost glucomannan powder ([https://www.amazon.com/Nutricost-Glucomannan-Powder-500-Grams/dp/B01EGTY358?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Nutricost-Glucomannan-Powder-500-Grams/dp/B01EGTY358?th=1)). According to the supplemental facts, 2 grams has 2 carbs. My recipe to make shirataki noodles requires 28 grams, so wouldn't that be 28 carbs?

The recipe seems to make as much noodles as the JFC brand bag and the size of the homemade noodles are similar as well.

I could reduce how much I eat by half and make it fit my macros but there is such a big difference in carbs, and at least with the JFC brand noodles I would know that I will stay under 5g carbs for ketosis. 

I am doing anything wrong? Maybe with calculations?"
keto,Keto+ OMAD Saved My Life!,"Ill start by saying I share this story to try to inspire others who are in a similar situation. I'd also like to thank the kind folks here at r/keto for the support and great tips. I am now approaching 4 months on the ketogenic lifestyle and have never felt better. Within a few short months, I have went from obese and depressed to truly a new person. I still have those pesky stretch marks but besides those my body has loved the lifestyle change. And trust me, being skinny and having stretch marks is a whole lot better than being fat with stretch marks!! If you are on the fence about starting keto, please take the leap and just go for it. The appetite suppression is one of my absolute favorite parts about keto. It has this weird way of making the ""diet"" turn into a healthy lifestyle. I never set a goal for myself and just kept trying to stay consistent with my macros. I am blessed to have lost almost 60lbs so far on my keto journey. I am finally approaching my goal weight but have no plans to stop Keto. People say keto is a fad, And they couldn't be more wrong. Keto truly has turned my life around for the better. And I figured posting in the place which gave me the most support would be a fitting end to a great day. Thank you, r/keto"
keto,"I haven’t tracked carbs, and this happened","I haven’t really eaten all that much today, ate some sausages for breakfast, had no lunch, no dinner, and there was no snacks in the kitchen that we’re keto friendly, and I have no choice but to eat 2 slices of bread. I think I might be OK but will this kick me out of ketosis?"
keto,Kefir alternative found!,"I’ll admit, I always find myself missing flavored kefir. I don’t typically enjoy eating yogurt and have always preferred drinking it. I found “Pillars” makes a no sugar added drinkable Greek yogurt with pre and pro biotics. Per 8 OZ it’s 70 cal, 0 fat, 3 net grams of carbs, and 15g protein. The sweetener used is organic stevia. I tried the mixed berry flavor and it is pretty good. As someone who tries to go under their fat allowance for the day, this made me very happy."
keto,SW:120kg CW:?? GW:90 KG 21 yrs 186cm Protein shakes?,"Hi! I started keto+20-4 IF 4 days ago, and i have some questions. I am kinda hungry at night after 45 ours of my eating window, and i get kinda hungry at the last 4-5 hours of my fasting, but its all fine i can take it, my problem is that I cant really eat 1500 kalories in the 4 hour window I feel too full. (My macros:248g protein: 31g carbs: 86g fat, tho i go with under 20 carbs).

My question is if it is a problem that i don't eat enough calories. I heard that the body can go into some kind of starvation mode so its not good and if so i will force myself to eat enough.

My other question is if i can drink protein shake because i fin it quite hard to reach my protein macro, im usually down like 40-60g. And if i can, should i use whey, or casein. Thanks for the answers, sorry if these questions are stupid!"
keto,High HS-CRP,"I’ve been working with my doctor the last 8 months to identify the cause of my high HS-CRP. We’re are fairly sure its not associated with diet but rather my actual body fat level. This seems like a catch 22. The fat is causing my chronic inflammation but chronic inflammation inhibits several pathways involved in fat mobilization and metabolism I still have at least 50 pounds before I get to my goal weight. I’m currently eating 2.25 pounds of 90/20 Ground Sirloin, 2oz beef liver/heart pate, 6 egg yolks, 1 tbps of butter, a quarter cup of olives, 1 can of sardines in water, 8oz of beef broth. I have none of the classic symptoms of inflammation like brain fog or ache joints. I lift full body 3 days a week and walk 4 miles daily. I have also been fasting for 2 days the last month. My issues isn’t that I’m not losing weight. I’m curious if their are any novel treatment ideas that can address my inflammation so I can maximize my next 8 weeks of this fat loss phase. Every other marker of health is perfect. From fasting insulin to lipids."
keto,A warning about electrolytes,"I have been on keto for several months and thought I should share a keto caused negative health related experience I had recently that at the time really frieked me out, but once I did some more research I was able to remedy and prevent in the future.

I had been doing OMAD keto (lazy just counting carbs) for a few months when I started to get some aching pains in my feet and knees, as well as had a couple nights where I had pretty bad leg cramps. I didn't really pay much attention and actually thought I was dehydrated so I started drinking more water on a regular basis. I think this was a mistake, because over time the pain got slightly worse, and one day I actually ended up having my vision go blurry very suddenly and I developed an absolutely horrible headache that hospitalized me (I've never had headaches like this one, could definitely be classified as a migrane as it was absolutely unbearable). Those of you with more keto experience probably already know what happened.

They ran tests and everything looked normal. I did however have potassium on the low end of normal as well as sodium and magnesium were in the lower end. I did some more research (which I should have done in the first place), and it became very clear that I was not consuming enough electrolytes.

I am starting to think supplementing electrolytes during long term keto is something that should really be pushed as a necessity for newcomers. I do wonder how many people end up writing off this diet because they had an experience like mine.

Since the event I have been supplementing 400mg of potassium and magnesium, and 1000mg of sodium per day. Since I started I gave felt all around much better both mentally and physically while in ketosis.

TLDR: I wasn't supplementing electrolytes on OMAD keto, and I ended up being hospitalized with the most painful headache I've ever had. Supplementing has fixed my issue and made me feel better."

I eat 2 hardboiled in a salad for lunch everyday, and I’ll scramble 4 or 5 for dinner once a week or so. I think its either $2.99 or $3.99.  for 36 eggs at the store (U.S dollars). Once the farmers market opens back up, I’ll get them from a farmer for $3.00 a dozen"
keto,GOD AWFUL stomach ache/cramps today,"I want to preface this by stating that my doctor is on vacation; I called the office and they told me to go to their urgent care. Their urgent care is absolutely horrible, though, so I didn’t go.

I’ve been on keto for almost a month and a half. Since changing my eating habits, most of my stomach upsets have gone away, which has been awesome! However, today something awful happened. I was sitting at a coffee shop and I had diarrhea. No big deal, I just went to the bathroom and did my thing. When I walked out of the bathroom and sat back down, I experienced what I can only compare to labor pains. I’ve never given birth, but in my mind this is what I think labor pains would feel like. I had extremely painful cramps in somewhat of a V shape on my belly and my uterus area hurt so insanely bad. I damn near considered calling an ambulance because I didn’t know how the hell I was gonna make it out of there. I sat down for a few minutes and just calmed myself down. I gathered my belongings and left. I walked to my car and drove home with tears streaming down my face. My belly felt so tight and my cramps down there were something fierce. I got home and getting inside sucked too. I live on the second floor, I don’t even know how I made it up the stairs. 

My question is essentially this: could I be eating/drinking something that is causing this? I generally stay below 30 carbs a day. However, I have been drinking a lot more coffee flavored with a Vanilla-Splenda syrup. I also had two vodka on the rocks yesterday (I don’t drink often) AND I will admit, I ate a ton of spicy pork rinds yesterday. This pain was absolutely horrific, I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. Should I just cut out vodka and spicy stuff? I never want to experience that again."

keto,Feeling really discouraged...,"Hey guys...I've been doing Keto for 2 years now. I've lost 260lbs, down from 490 to 230, but I've out of nowhere reached a point where I just can't seem to lose weight! I'm tracking my macros on Carb Manager and even when I come under, adhering to the macros for ""Sedentary"" activity, I still can't seem to get below 230/231. I even get in about 12,000 to 15,000 steps a night at my job and I still get no results. I don't understand why out of nowhere, my body isn't making any progress. My goal is 220lbs, so I can go skydiving in the summer and it really bums me out that I'm so close to the finish line and I've hit a brick wall. I know sometimes you can hit a plateau, but this has been about 3 weeks to a month now, with no progress at all! I'm just feeling really discouraged. Is this really normal, has this happened to any of you for this long? Any recommendations for overcoming this barrier?"
keto,Tips for Ketogenic Diet,"1. Drink water before and after meals to suppress hunger and make you feel fuller  

2. Stay hydrated, it's just healthy and helps any form of weight loss.  

3. Get some exercise in, nothing crazy. 30 minutes of walking is all you need, maybe 3-7 times a day. Exercising is not required for weight loss in keto diet.  

4. Try to eat as far into the day as possible so you don't end up eating too often.   

5. Limit how many meals you eat a day to avoid feeling. On a keto diet, you shouldn't feel hungry very often because your body is in ketosis, so take advantage of that to decrease caloric intake. Make sure to diversify your foods and get some veggies in to get proper nutrition.  

6. Avoid environments where non-keto foods are available. This is obvious but very important. If, for example, your family is eating cookies in the kitchen, stay in your room doing something else  

7. Keep in mind that the beginning of starting a keto diet is the hardest, then your cravings will go away and so is your appetite.   

8. You can still overeat on keto. No matter what diet or exercise plan you're on, if you're overeating, you'll see less results. Make sure that you're eating slowly and not having big proportions.  

9. Best to limit yourself up to 20 carbs. It's a limit, not a goal, you don't have to try to hit 20 carbs. Realize that this is the recommended maximum to guarantee ketosis. 

10. If you mess up, it's okay. I didn't stick to the keto diet on my first try. You have so many more times to try again. Forgive yourself, realize you can't change the past, and move on."
keto,Made new lifestyle changes and wondering if what I eat would be considered Keto?,"[Food](https://i.gyazo.com/fa3d787b5b239e8182bb05c2bf86b350.png)

So in March after losing out on GME (And a lot of research into carbs and sugar documentary and more etc but that's less dramatic) I decided to completely change my lifestyle and started a 1 week fast and then slowly moved to a 22 hours Intermittent fasting, slowly adding healthy foods.

Then after a bit, I started swapping stuff around then adding exercise, I decided to add a salad to the diet and experimented with eating times, now eating 2:10 pm Salad wise and 6:30-7 pm during the main meal (I eat the walnuts and dark chocolate right after dinner, so I count it as a main meal) time which I assume would count as a 6-hour eating window even though I only eat twice.

Though I can feel the difference from extremely unhealthy junk food and Irn Bru (fizzy drinks) every day to this diet, I lost about 15-18kg from the fast alone, though I plateaued a bit from then as I stayed at 120kg for 2 weeks, this could be from countless of things and I also started to do 1 hour walks every day in the morning and pushed my waking up time to 6:15 AM, so hopefully that speeds up the system health and metabolic wise"

I am (Male 42yo - Height 6ft/182cm  Start Weight on 10 Feb = 94.8 Kg 209lbs Current Weight 8 Apr  = 91.8kg/202lbs   


I have seen a lot of people lose more in that period on here and I also have  a similar build friend who lost 14lbs in 3 weeks.   


I followed my Macros but have over the last 3.5 weeks gone super strict, this has included not drinking any alcohol this saw maybe 1.5kg.   
Daily meals are usually:  
Breakfast   3 egg and spinach omelette with some cheese,  
lunch tuna or chicken with mayo and lettuce,   
Dinner steak and broccoli or asparagus or chicken with spinach and feta salad.   
Snacks are usually cheese, a few almonds or raspberries.   
Carbs are never more than 22grams per day usually less, everything is weighed. I drink water or herbal teas with the odd coffee with double cream  


I train weightlifting 4x per week (back, legs, chest, shoulders) coupled with 1-2 5km runs per week and 2x 20km bike rides.  


While I see the flab going a little I'm surprised at so little shift in weight. In 2019 I did IF 18/6 or 20/4 for 5 months with lots of cycling - approx 140km per week and dropped 10kg.

I don't even know where to start. I tried the help section but even then it's all just walls of text and links. I'm hopeless.

I guess what I'm asking is how do you start? What do you buy without everything all spoiling and even then where would I start?

I couldn't find a meal plan or a simple shopping list. I need help guys, I'm reaching out. I'm 5'5"", I'm overweight. Last time I weighed myself I was at 197lb. I work at a gas station (graveyard shift) so you can imagine all the junk around me. I feel pain in my body, I get anxiety and even while mopping I feel myself breathing heavy. I want to get back to a healthier weight and wish I knew where to begin the process.

I received my stationary bike today so I'm happy for that. I hope to get some insight from you wonderful folk."
keto,"I keep falling my carb goal of &lt;20g. When I do, I feel like I'm eating way over my calories than I normally would pre-keto.","I fear that by not keeping my carbs under 20g on those particular days, which turns into a cycle of eating more carbs, im inadvertently adding additional calories that I wouldn't otherwise be eating by not doing keto. Simply because, I'll eat as much protein to get to my goal, and then I'll slip and eat junk at night, which turns into junk for lunch the next day. I also think a big thing is being too lazy/busy to cook over the ease of fast food. Anyone dealing with this that could offer any tips? I've only been doing keto for about a month or so and I had some nice streaks and generally ate less than I would when I don't eat carbs, but when I slip I slip hard :("
keto,Keto and Hypertension,"Hello guys,  I’ve been doing Keto off and on for about 3 years, I tend to do 3 month Keto then 3 months low carb.  I was diagnosed with type two diabetes 5 years ago and so get regular health check ups, thankfully my blood sugars have been good every time I go since I started Keto (no surprise there!) however at my latest check up I had hypertension.  OK I thought I best up my health so I got back on Keto started adding HIIT workouts to my admittedly modest workout and even threw in intermittent fasting 18/4 into the mix.  

Cut to 3 weeks later I was feeling great, lost a few pounds and had adapted to intermittent fasting much better than I had expected.  I went back to the nurse feeling confident but got the news that my blood pressure had gone up!  

I’ve been recommended to cut salt out of my diet, but when I am on keto I find I feel lethargic 
If I don’t get salt and even more so during intermittent fasting.  Has anyone else had high blood pressure while on Keto and how did you deal with it?"
keto,Threw up (possibly) from exogenous ketones and coffee during IF,"I know exogenous ketones isn’t necessary (at all) for keto, but curiosity got the best of me and I had to try it. I especially wanted to see how they worked during a fast.

I’ve been trying them twice a day (pill form. The package says to take two) for the past 4 days. With meals I’ve had no issues, but the past two mornings I’ve taken them on an empty stomach because of intermittent fasting, followed with my usual coffee right after. About an hour later I felt sudden discomfort and had to vomit urgently. This happened in the exact same way and timeframe both mornings. After vomiting I felt fine. Coffee a few hours later, still no food, was also ok.

I’ve been doing IF and some 36hr fasts for the past 1,5 months with absolutely no issues, and coffee on an empty stomach has been just fine. Absolutely no discomfort or anything. 

So I’m assuming the ketones have something to do with it. Could it be the combination with coffee? Combination of minerals/vitamins (I’m also taking multivitamins, magnesium, and extra iron because I donated blood last week. But also no problems with these alone, with coffee)?

I love the IF lifestyle, and don’t want to give up on the ketones just yet. I at least want to try a longer fast first.

Does anyone have a remotely similar experience, or just know in general what the issue could be? Should I only take them during longer fasts, drop the morning coffee, or take the two pills during my eating window?

Thank you, sorry if this is dumb haha"
keto,"Kendra’s keto journey.. “I’m closer than ever to my goal weight! I have energy to do things with my children,” Kendra says.","Can a keto diet help you lose 100 pounds (45 kilos), boost your energy levels, and gain an interest in exercising? Yes! All these things happened to Kendra thanks to the low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) diet.

*“I’m closer than ever to my goal weight! I have energy to do things with my children,”* Kendra says.

Here’s Kendra’s inspiring story, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

## Kendra’s keto journey

My name is Kendra, I’m 32 years old, and I live in the US Midwest.

﻿I started following the keto diet in April 2018. Since then, I’ve lost over 100 pounds (45 kilos)!

Initially, it wasn’t easy. I used to overdo it on snacks, sweets, and fast food. My portion sizes were out of control.

I realized that not only was I setting *myself* up for health issues, like diabetes, congestive heart failure, and high blood pressure that run in my family, but I was setting *my children* up for the same.

I decided enough was enough. A friend told me about the keto diet and the success she was having, and I started the next day.

These days, I cook at home and we rarely eat out. I’ve learned how to cook a variety of healthy and delicious meals. I can make just about any dish keto-friendly. I’ve also incorporated intermittent fasting. On most days, my eating window is 12 pm to 8 pm, and at least one day a week I do ‘one meal a day’ .

Of course, there have been times when I’ve eaten high-carb foods, but eating these foods only made me realize that my body just doesn’t agree with them. Low carb is what works best for me.

keto,Number of Calories in Keto,"I’m in strict Keto since 2 weeks, I succeeded 10gr carbs per day but I’m not monitoring how much calories I’m eating per day.

keto,Consistently Feeling Like Ass,"So I quit a 15 year drinking habit on April 18th of last year. This is something I never thought I'd be able to say. Though I feel quite happy with this accomplishment, I'm overwhelmed with the feeling of hopelessness, and I fear that I will never consistently feel good/healthy; because despite my cessation of alcohol consumption, I'm still waking up multiple days a week feeling hungover. What does this have to do with keto?? Well. Just stick with me here. 

Several months ago, I also decided to quit a detrimental sugar addiction that developed after I quit alcohol. This is when I decided to make the change to the ketogenic WOE. (I did keto 3 years ago and really enjoyed how full of life it made me, so I wanted to return to it.) 

So I've been making a lot of adjustments to try to better myself, but I keep having strings of bad days where lethargy overcomes my body (especially since starting keto this time around.) I can go several days feeling so energetic and productive, beaming with health and stamina; but then come the series of days where my body feels like one big heavy brick, and getting out of bed feels like a feat. 

Well, I had an epiphany yesterday that maybe, just maybe the hangover feeling and overall lethargy have something to do with an electrolyte imbalance and dehydration? So I did a lot of reading and came to the conclusion that I need to start supplementing electrolytes. I mixed up a lovely ketoade yesterday morning and happily gulped that salty concoction down. And ya know what?? Yesterday was great! I had energy, my brain wasn't foggy, and I was happy! I thought, ""Wow! What an easy fix to an issue that has been plaguing me for months!""

And then I woke up today feeling like shit again. Even after consuming a few ketoades. 

I know I'm being verbose, but I just wanted to give a little bit of background so you all could maybe help me out. 

My brain in so foggy right now that I don't even know what question I came here to ask. Electrolytes? 

Maybe I just wanted to vent. I'm exhausted, and I don't know what else to try."

My suggestion is the snack pack sugar free strawberry orange jello instead. I believe the ingredients fit the guidelines and it's $1.00 for 4 portions.

Have you done it in the past? What are some of your tips?

The one thing that’s keeping me on the lookout is my water intake. I can survive the fasting with no food, but when it comes to water (and the water we’re supposed to intake during Keto) it’s making me think hard."

keto,Can someone help me understand why keto works?,"Hey guys, I've been lurking on and off for some time. I've been trying to eat better for a while and have done strict keto for over a month. I lost seventeen pounds in the time. I understand that our bodies use glucose for energy when carbohydrates are introduced to our diet. I get that our body switches to producing ketones for fuel when glucose isn't present. What I don't understand is how I'm able to lose weight so aggressively by still eating. In fact, I've heard that one can lose more weight with keto than by fasting! I think my mind still might still be set in the CICO worldview. Any help would be great. I've recruited some family members to the keto side and they're happy with it, but I still don't quite understand how to explain."
keto,Fast,"Typically I’ll eat dinner at 7 or 8, then *sometimes* a keto (low carb) snack around 9 or 10; I’ll eat breakfast anywhere between 9-11 depending on how hungry I am when I wake up. Is a 12-13 hour fast sufficient or should I try for longer?"
keto,Fat macro as a “limit” caused weight gain,"I found this sub a couple weeks ago and read about fat macro being a limit, not a goal. So, I stopped eating as much fat and upped my protein to make up for the calories. I didn’t change my carb macro- I eat under 20g net, and it’s a hard line for me. 
So what gives? I’ve gained 3 lbs in 10 days and nothing has changed otherwise.

I am about to go for my first 5 mile run while in ketosis and was wondering if anyone had any ideas or suggestions for things I should be eating before and after the run.

keto,Breaking keto and then fasting to reset,"Hello, was hoping anyone could help me out, I've been trying to find any good info and not finding much on this specific question.

Me and the wife were doing keto for about two months consistently in preparation of her getting pregnant again (she wanted to get rid of the excess pounds following our first kid, the plan is to go off keto fully for about a month prior to getting pregnant to ensure nutrient levels are fine. I understand people do pregnant keto but not planning for that at the moment).

After about two months, she was having trouble staying with it without cheat days. She had been making some new Indian friends and doesn't want to be the weird person who can't eat their very carb-heavy food with them.

Basically our strategy has been to cheat either one or both weekend days depending on social plans, sometimes only for a single meal a day and sometimes more substantially, and then do a 32-hour zero calorie fast from Sunday night to Tuesday morning for the autophagy to try and reset the keto.

Does anyone know if this is hard on the system or if we'd really be getting much of the keto benefits from doing this? I do notice I tend to feel mild keto flu-like symptoms that make me somewhat drained on Monday and Tuesday, but I feel in out evolutionary past that having regular binge and famine days would be fairly standard so hoping it isn't actually doing damage."

So I really need the focus and energy from a good balanced meal.

I figure I'll stick with meats and green veggies but then I see people discuss vitamins and electrolytes and how some meal plans need supplements in the form of mult-vitamins or something.

Then I remember this is why I always find keto so daunting. It seems like there's so much consider, so much calculating, counting, making sure macros fit.

keto,Blood glucose and weight loss,"I'm a type 2 diabetic eschewing meds so I've been doing keto+IF and tracking both my blood glucose levels and weight daily. 

My diet has been pretty consistent for the past several weeks since I started tracking all this. My fasting blood glucose (BG) has been low 90s (mg/dL) to low 100s and are typically between 110 and 120 2-hours after a meal.

Every now and then, I'll get a postprandial BG reading that's between 15 to 20 mg/dL higher than usual. It's not necessarily because of what I've eaten. As I said, I've been eating pretty consistently--I'll just rotate through some group of foods over and over. So this just means that for whatever reason, the same low carb meal that I typically eat will cause my BG to increase.

When this happens, almost without fail, my weight the following morning will be between 0.6 and a full pound lower than the previous morning. 

I'm not sure if the higher BG is causing me to piss more or something, but there seems to be a correlation. 

Note though that I AM NOT advocate that you eat more carbs to cause your BG to go up. I'm just saying that on the occasion that my typical keto meal causes my BG to go up for whatever reason, it seems to be a precursor to a drop in weight."

keto,Frustration and Disappointment... thoughts anyone?,"Just finished about 30 days keto. Got my keto-meter and... what a disappointment ...😭 - have only 0.4 when ketosis starts at a minimum of 0.5... 
 I've been kind of strict - Almost zero carbs , zero sweets and a lot of fatty food (meat, fish, fat cheese, eggs). 
Any thoughts anyone? Am I doing something wrong here? Am I missing something?"
keto,Very high ketones 100mg/dL +,"Hi my ketones are very high this morning, somewhere over 100mg/dL, and I’m not feeling well, I’m a 25 year old male, 5’10, 185 pounds around 12% body fat. And I’m wondering if my ketones are too high that it’s becoming dangerous, I’ve been on this diet for 10 days and felt pretty good, ketones have never exceeded 40 mg:dL until today, I had diarrhea all night and I feel weak this morning, which also is when my ketones have been the highest. Could this just be the “keto flu” or am I pushing it to far?"
keto,NIC NEW GUY,"Hello everyone, new here. I am starting Keto this morning and was wondering what veggies are ok to eat. Coming off of a lower carb diet but no luck. I have tried carnivore but the amount of food I have to eat to get 230 grams of protein  was entirely to much food for me. So down the Keto road I go. Hopefully for the long haul."
keto,I am extremely close to bailing on Keto if something doesn't change soon. Advice needed!,"I started keto on January 4. Also did intermittent fasting 18:6 plus some OMAD. The first 18 lbs melted off. I have absolutely plateaued recently and the scale has barely budged in 5 weeks. My wedding is in 4 months and I need to lose 20 more lbs in order to return to pre-covid weight and fit into this very expensive gown! I gained a lot of weight during lockdown.

Yesterday I did a bone broth fast. I did not eat a morsel. I have not eaten since Sunday at 6pm and I GAINED 2 LBS. WHAT THE F\*CK IS GOING ON???? SOMEONE HELP ME OR I'M BAILING AND GOING TO CICO. 

Weight loss as a woman is THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING EVER. I have been extremely strict and have not cheated on this diet once and the scale is NOT BUDGING. We are doing a weight loss competition at work (with a $500 prize that I was banking on for things for my wedding), and I gained 2 lbs this week despite my best efforts. I need to win! I tried recalculating my macros, and nothing.

If anyone has any ideas, I'm all ears!"
keto,Personalizing your keto experience,"Hey, all. So I’ve done my research and been on keto for about 2 weeks now, and I get the gist of it. Pretty straightforward High Fat, Moderate protein, and low carbs. But I’m new to actually caring about my diet and I’ve noticed a lot with reading other peoples stories and watching videos online that some food combinations works better for some and not other people and a lot of times people have to tweak their diet to their body type, exercise level, and the specific affects it has specifically on their body and it helps them tremendously. I’m confused on what to look for specifically in my body to see which foods have the most favorable effect for me. I noticed that a glycemic response varies from person to person and that’s super important, are there any other tiny details that lead up to my overall outcome that I can note down and do experiments with to craft the perfect combinations of food for myself? I know it’s better to sometimes keep it simple but honestly getting into the scientific tiny details is actually what I love about doing this diet, it helps me understand my body more and what i put into it so go as deep as you can. I hope my question was clear enough for you all, have a good day 😃  Also it might help to note, I’m a 25 year old female, around 190 pounds, more of an athletic build, a lot of weight around the tummy and thighs, I’m fairly active because even though I have desk job I average 11,000 steps per weekday and then I work out on weekends."

keto,Struggling to keto with carby family,"So, I understand the logical answer is; ""it's a lifestyle, just do it, ignore what they do, do what makes you feel the best, etc"". Unfortunately I am the head chef at Cafe de la Worm and el wifa is a carb fiend (does not negatively impact her and she tried low carb, she became a monster). We also have a 1 year old and another on the way in September, so needless to say there are a lot of meals requiring carbs. My willpower was great with just the wife, but with the kids, lack of sleep, and constant cooking or carbs it has been reduced. Wife is as supportive as one could be.

keto,Is stevia as healthy as they say? And why I’m going aspartame free for life!,"So I came across this factoid. Aspartame, a very common sweetener, it’s in just about every diet soft drink there is. When it’s warmed and cooled it converts to formaldehyde! If you don’t know what that is, is a chemical uses to preserve corpses, it’s extremely carcinogenic (causes cancer). And it’s not necessarily boiling it, it can be the natural warming and cooling patterns in your house, it’s slower but is still happening. 

I’ve researched stevia as I found some reasonably priced drinks with it, including coca cola. If you look up aspartame, the formaldehyde thing isn’t readily out there. The person I found it out from  know a lot about chemistry and can’t reach them right now. Anyone with knowledge of sweeteners know if there’s hidden health effects of stevia?"

I’ve been on Keto for 3 weeks now and haven’t broke once! Last night my baby was just up all night and at 1am I craved chocolate so bad (low energy I guess?) and I ate some chocolate bunny! I ate about 50g of chocolate which works out at average of 5G of carbs.

Seasoning, marinades anything that seems to add flavour has some sort of carbs

Just a heads up to be careful. Things which you migh think are OK turn out to be not so ok. Lots of sneaky ingredients might up your carb intake unknowingly"

Nothing seems to help and I’m at a loss of what else to try. I drink plenty of liquids and my urine is never dark or clear. My keto diet is super clean and I never see any holes in Cronometer.

31.F.southern Oregon. Lyme disease
I had previously had success with keto a year or so ago. I decided to come off it as I was working out so hard and plateaued. I lost roughly 70 lbs. 

Skip ahead, and I ended up extremely sick last summer and was diagnosed with Lyme disease. I could no longer exercise like before and depression hit so hard! The only way I know to cope is eating, which caused me to gain back 20-25 lbs. 

My doc states keto should be my diet of choice in regards to the Lyme disease for as long as I have symptoms (possibly forever). I find myself dreading the idea and also not trusting myself to follow through without using food (especially carbs!) as my drug of choice. I am also struggling to find low intensity workouts due to knee and joint pain. 

If anyone has any good ideas as far as mentally preparing myself to be consistent with keto, not binge,  low impact exercises... it would be so greatly appreciated. 🤍🖤"

keto,"If my goal is to lose as much fat as possible as quickly as possible while maintaining lean muscle, should I avoid anaerobic workouts like lifting and sprinting?"," I only vaguely understand that ketones are great for aerobic exercise and not useful anaerobic exercise. When I lift, my keystones drop and glucose goes up (another complicated process I don’t really understand) So where’s it getting the glucose from? My first though is glycogenesis through my muscles so basically it’s breaking down my muscles as I’m trying to build them. Is this the case? While I’m lifting and keystones drop do I stop burning fat? It would seem counterproductive to the goal. Should I just stick with brisk walking and light jogging to get to the stated goal?"

keto,How bad is it to not calculate things? Seems to be working,"I have been avoiding carbohydrates for one week now, resulting in me losing 7lbs. 


I'm well aware a good fraction of that will be from the magical water weight/carb weight that comes from starting a diet, but still it is the largest amount of weight I've ever lost in a week. My old record was 4. 

I have read a fair few posts and articles about keto and I'm pretty sure I understand the process, though I am skipping a few steps. 

I do not know my macros, I do not weigh my food in-depth, I am very loosely counting calories and the only real number I'm tracking is carbs. 

My typical intake is between 15-30 carbs, it varies based on what meals I have. 

Are there any serious issues with not collecting statistics on my food?

I am taking a multivitamin and omega3 oil since I am not a seafood fan. 

I'm not eating like a sparrow either, my portions are large and I do not go hungry. 

I eat 2 meals a day with no snacks, an average day consists of an omlette (3 eggs, salami, cheese, salt, pepper, chives) as my first meal and a large portion of meat and brocolli for my second. Sometimes I switch the 2nd meal out for sausages and fried eggs. 

Driving water, black coffee and black tea. 

Overall, I feel great. My appetite seems to be getting worse every single day but my energy level is so high. My breath smells like fermented fruit and I am expelling so much waste. 

As far as I can see, I am achieving ketosis, I just hope I'm not dooming myself by not doing the maths. 

I know I'll give up if I need to carry the 7 and divide by 2 slices of bacon just to eat. 

Any insights from some more seasoned Individuals would be greatly appreciated."

3 months later, I am down another 18 lbs. Wearing pants the size I might have worn at 15...

This isn't a bragging post, it's a... I need off this ride post. As I dropped to 36 jeans, people said you look great, stop. Then I hit 34 and more said, fine, stop. Now I had to go down to 32 and a tall above 6' guy.. I realize I have to stop and hit maintenance. But I have had a hard time quitting. Fear.

keto,Extremely High triglyceride levels? (Wasn’t fasted) 28 year old male,"Hello Keto community,

I was wondering if any of you have experience with high triglycerides while doing keto?

In the past, while doing keto I would bounce around from 150 to my lowest of about 37. 

Over the past year and a half I’ve significantly gained weight eating junk and not being able to workout, but recently have been trying to get back to keto and working out. 

The nurse called me back and said my triglycerides were extremely high (1081), but I immediately told her I wasn’t fasted, to which she then replied “regardless it shouldn’t be near that amount”.

That morning I had sandwich meat, 6 ounces of ground beef, a slice of cheese, a carb balance tortilla, and a probably a decent amount of Mayo on the side to dip in. About 5 hours later I went to get labs done but specifically told them I wasn’t fasted and that I’d have to wait for the lipid panel(which I guess they tested).

I’d feel more at ease knowing my triglycerides are high if they were somewhere around 300-400, but I’m wondering if me eating a high fat meal hours before can influence them that much?

I plan to get back to fasting 16-20 hours a day while lifting\cardio in the mean time."

keto,Keto despite Histamine Sensitivity?,"I´ve been on a low carb diet for a really long time and most times I feel fine, but I get these days where the carb cravings get really bad and I just start binging and it´s really triggering my eating disorder, so then I´m starving myself the next day and I just want to get out of that cycle. 

I thought a keto diet might end my carb cravings and bring me a peace of mind, but I tried it three times already and it never worked.

It´s the exact same thing every single time: The first two days I feel fine, but then on the third day I wake up with a racing heart beat, feeling like I have the worst panic attack of my life, or a heart attack or something. I also get violently sick and the throwing-up only stops after several hours and only after eating something like a piece of toast, because simply the thought of eating more fat makes me sick again.

I thought it was an extreme kind of keto flue, but then I´ve read that it could be a severe reaction to histamine. I think it´s called histamine dumping? 

Now I don´t really understand why that happened, I basically ate the same, fresh foods as usual, I drank a lot of water, I basically just cut out the bread and the oats from my diet until I hit the requiered macros and thats it.

I´ve always had a problem with certain foods like hazel nuts, but I just don´t eat them, I never had an allergic reaction this severe to anything in my entire life.

keto,Crashing mood after carbs?,"So my wife thinks this is probably a placebo effect or I’m imagining it, but:

- I’ve been doing keto for about 7 months. Feeling good during that time. 
- I’ve noticed that if I cheat, my mood goes super low a day or two later. This Easter weekend I completely went off keto for a short break - like I’m talking caramel popcorn 3 nights in a row. And today I have that hopeless, really low depressed feeling.

Anyone else experienced that?"
keto,Should I stay on keto?,"Ok, so im 18F and have been on keto for about two months. I really enjoy it, its actually been pretty easy to adjust and I have almost no cravings. I take birth control so I was expecting to have no issues hormonally, as I’ve had no issues for the past year and a half in terms of regularity. Immediately after switching to keto my cycle is very off and even a few months in has yet to adjust. It hasn’t stopped, it’s just irregular. Should I up my carb intake? I try to stay under 15g of (net) carbs per day so maybe I’m being too restrictive. I’m also only eating around 900-1100 calories because I’m usually not hungry enough for more and I can’t exercise due to a recent surgery. I was usually eating around 1100-1200 calories daily and weight lifting 5x per week. I’ve been worried about my hormones since my cycle has been off and I’ve heard keto can be a part of that. I’m also worried about not eating enough, even though I know 900 calories isn’t enough I’m just not that hungry on keto. Are there any adjustments I could make to maybe help keto work for me, or should I switch to something like a plain calorie defecit and focus on getting my calorie intake correct? If it means anything I calculated my BMR and its around 1360 calories, but it also said something about my intake for sedentary activity level (right now) should be around 1595. Im not sure if thats useful in helping me decide what I should do. I just know it’s probably not good for my body to be 400-600 calories short of my BMR. I dont know how accurate that is to be fair, I also understand that eating less than 1200 calories per day is unhealthy. Should I prioritize calorie intake or following keto? Again I’m really struggling to eat enough with keto, and I have a bit of a history of disordered eating and while I’m not struggling with that coming back I am worried that it will. I don’t know what to blame the hormonal issues on, and I’m a bit worried about not eating enough. Any advice would help :)"

keto,How to get over guilt wasting food,"Some background: I live with my significant others family. It is 5 of us total with two working (and eating) at home daily. Because of eating at home for lunch his mom tends to prepare massive dinners so that we have plenty of leftovers to choose from. Fortunately, most of the food is healthy, I can usually avoid the carbs and sweets easily.

However, I feel stressed every time I open the fridge and see tons of leftovers. I just feel bad about it going to waste. Thus, to help that guilt I find myself wanting to eat a little more. For example, I’ll grab an extra rib just to get rid of the leftovers.

It’s crazy that I’m worried about this because I’m not paying for the food. Has anyone else experienced this type of guilt?"
keto,"I thought I was an alcoholic, but after losing my carb cravings on keto, I no longer crave beer.","I’ve spent years struggling with addiction to drinking beer, and never connected it in my mind to my similar addiction to starchy foods and bread/crackers etc. I presumably have become fat adapted after about a month and a half in and in addition to the loss of 18lbs I have the added bonus of having zero cravings for beer. I had an addiction, but it wasn’t to what I thought it was.

I do acknowledge that there is probably a little alcohol dependence mixed in, but regardless I’ve stopped both vices and feel better than I have in a long time."
keto,"NSV: Loose Watches and Wedding Rings and Adam's Apples, Oh My!","Just wanted to share a few NSV's I've experienced recently.  I started my keto journey for the 3rd or 4th time on December 15th, so I'm coming up on 4 months of keto.  While in the past I've succumbed to cheat days that just never ended or went on vacations where it was very difficult to find food that was keto-friendly, this pandemic has actually helped me!  I haven't had a single cheat day that I would consider a cheat day.  I've generally kept to less than 20g carbs per day, only once or twice going up to 35-40.  I'm mostly OMAD but sometimes TMAD on weekends.   I don't really snack throughout the day, and whenever I feel those hunger pangs, I just drink water until I'm full and that satiates me for a while.

I started at around 325 - that's my best guess.  I don't know exactly because A) I was afraid to step on the scale, and B) my scale doesn't go above 300.  I'm currently at about 275, so around 50 pounds lost in 4 months.

While I have seemed to plateau a little bit scale-weight wise recently (seemed to be stuck around 280 for a couple weeks), that has begun dropping again.

I've found that when washing my hands, my wedding rings falls off if I'm not careful, and it's super loose regularly.  I usually take it off when cooking dinner as I wash my hands frequently and sometimes forget to put it back on.  My husband has even brought it to me asking if I was planning on leaving him since I keep leaving it places lol.  Unfortunately it's made of titanium so it can't be resized, but we only bought cheap rings at the start of our marriage with the intention of getting nicer ones in the future.  Maybe this is the impetus for that!

I recently found a fitbit and decided to charge it and wear it some more - I haven't worn it in probably 6 months, and now, it's so loose that I need to take another link out of the strap!

Most noticeable to me, was that I can actually SEE my Adam's Apple now!  I went so long not even realizing I couldn't see it, but my neck was so fat that it was hidden.  Now that I can see it again, I notice how many of my facial features have changed, and it's all the more motivation to keep going!

I truly have this subreddit to thank for all the encouragement, recipes, and general info!"
keto,Found a delish low-carb pasta option!,"My wife and I have been keto for 1.5 years and love it. She's lost over 100 lbs! 

Over the years, we've tried a lot of the pasta replacements (pasta zero, palmini, zoodles, etc.) and just tried Explore Cuisine Organic Black Bean Fettuccini last night (came in our Misfits Market box!). 

I had to share, it was delicious!! 

With 6 net carbs and \~25 G protein, it's our new favorite! I was expecting it to break down in the boiling water, but it didn't at all. Also, once cooked, the recommended serving size feels very generous. 

Thought I'd share for those people craving a solid pasta replacement!"
keto,Keto for reducing LDL cholesterol,"I just had my annual physical with my doctor and they did some blood work. The results show that I have high LDL (bad) cholesterol. The recommendation for lowering LDL cholesterol is reducing saturated fats, such as full fat dairy products and red meat. I am wondering what people on here have experienced with a Keto diet and the affects on LDL cholesterol. Any comments are greatly appreciated. Thanks."
keto,Does liquid oil cause stomach trouble?,"I ate baked vegetable with cheese (cauliflower, salt, pepper, cheese oil) but added so much oil that it was free-flowing. Does free-flowing oil cause more stomach trouble than fat that is part of the food (nuts) or oil that is well dissolved in food?

further if oil causes stomach trouble for me then how can I complete my calorie requirement to gain weight"
keto,"Part-Time Keto, is it possible?","Hey guys! 

I have been on OMAD and occasionally ADF for quite some time now. I am considering starting Keto, because carbs are my worst enemy. Once I start eating bread, there is no stopping me. But, I have a question about keto during social engagements etc. 

I spend a lot of weekend evenings having dinner with friends and family and I don't want to obligate them to adapt/change anything due to my diet. I also feel it's weird to just bring my own food. How do you guys go about this? Is it possible to do keto part-time (for example during weekdays and then eat a little more carbs on the weekends)? Also, did you completely cut out alcohol, or do you make exceptions for special occasions? 

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear about your personal experiences and tips and tricks!!"
keto,Some surprising victories this weekend.,"F 53, 89 days on keto, 29.6 lbs lost to date.

I found myself enjoying a couple of NSVs and a couple of SV's this weekend!   My first NSV was that I was able to move my belt down a notch. I've been needing to use a belt as my pants are all getting too loose! Score. The other NSV took me by surprise. I sat down to watch some TV and I noticed I'd unconsciously crossed my legs and it was comfortable! I haven't been able to just cross my legs in...well... too long! Score #2!  SV's: I have now lost 1/2 of my initial loss goal (reaching onederland) and I've lost over 10% of my starting body weight. SCORE all around! YES!!

Seeing the progress in my clothing, my physical comfort and in the scale stats is keeping me motivated!  Thanks to this subreddit for the continuing motivation. :)"
keto,How to stay full on keto,"I've been doing the ""anabolic diet"" for the past many months and I enjoy switching things up. My biggest reason for choosing the anabolic diet is because the levels of satiety I achieve as a person who normally struggles with feeling full. What should i expect going into keto as far as how full I will feel?"
keto,How much protein can I have at once?,"I work out quite a bit each day and really like to make sure I hit or exceed my protein - because of this I normally take protein supplements as well. I go between Premier Protein shakes and Isopure zero carb powder.

Anyways, is it true that after ingesting a certain amount (I read 25-30g) in one sitting, that the excess will essentially be flushed out?

I like to do 2 scoops of powder or 1 scoop mixed with a Premier shake especially as a meal post-workout but now I’m not sure if I’m just “wasting” those extra grams."
keto,"Almost died today, i think.","Long story short, I’m on week 2 of keto? Been going great. Today i unfortunately cut myself washing dishes and got stitches. After 15 minutes since the injury, we were still cleaning the wound cause it kept bleeding everything was turning white and cloudy, hearing got muffled. I swear i thought i was going to die. I blacked out for a few seconds and was sweating like crazy. Once i came back, color wasn’t coming back yet so i had to scarf down some left over fries and tacos my sister fortunately had just got home with. Ate the food &amp; Drank Gatorade zero on the way to the ER and started to feel better.
I’m assuming it was cause of the low blood pressure that i fainted. Doctor said it was most likely vasovagal, regardless of being bother by blood or not, it still happens. But i don’t think it was that. I mean sort of but i really thought i was going to die. Like i said the colors started changing and looking out the window it was really white and cloudy, i could barely even see my neighbors window when usually i could their entire house, chimney, fence and even the apartment complex on the other side of them. my hearing was practically gone. I couldnt understand my family when they were trying to talk to me. It all sounded very quiet and it didn’t happen instantly. This all happened with in a few minutes. I’ve never heard of anyone taking their time to faint...

I don’t really know the point of this. Not trying to bash keto, it helped me a lot. I broke the diet today and ate whatever i wanted (without going overboard) cause it really scared me. I don’t have a reliable source or guidance so I’m just winging it over here. :/ 

I’m really concerned about this diet with all the diabetes stuff i can’t get answered to. I only use sources that support keto but all i get is people telling me “don’t listen to haters”, keto supporter isn’t a hater... or “read the FAQs”. Yeah i did and it’s says the FAQs is not a doctor so do it at my own risk. 

Again, I’m not trying to bash but I guess I’m just really sad now i might have to give up keto. I lost 14lbs so I’m proud of that. Doctor said it’s fine to keep going but didn’t really go into. All they were trying to do is get me in and out of there. 

So can anyone recommend a safer diet for me?"
keto,Ever had problems with konjac noodles?,Apparently they can cause intestinal blockage. So has anyone that eats it regularly had an issues? Not necessarily a blockage but GI discomfort? I miss ramen and think I need a touch more fibre in my diet.
keto,Keto causing sleep issues,"It took me a long time to make the connection but any time I'm in Keto my sleep gets affected. When I fall off the wagon and eat carbs I sleep like a baby after a day or two. I only really noticed it because I haven't been very strict this past year and have dipped in and out making it more noticeable, but it's always been a problem.

What I mean is that I don't really have trouble falling asleep but I'll wake up two or three times a night and will only sleep for about 6 hours versus my usual 8 or 9. It doesn't feel deep sleep and is kinda similar to that false sleep you can get from some sleeping pills where it feels more like you just had your eyes closed for 8 hours.

Interestingly, I don't really feel tired during the day with less sleep on Keto but I don't wake feeling particularly rested. 

I don't have any sleep issues normally. Anyone else have this problem and found a solution? Any insights are appreciated"
keto,Question about powdered drink mixes and an analysis on Maltodextrin,"So I'm totally familiar with maltodextrin and how bad it is on keto. My question is regarding the amount of Kool-Aid I make sweetened with pure sucralose powder. The idea of using the powder because of the maltodextrin has been vilified a ton it seems when I talk to people so I'm just asking here for clarification :)  


 For the [Blue Raspberry Lemonade Kool-Aid](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/2c726085-4fab-4745-88fe-0f8145f6c860.93bc05d0c57f82606b4315ee6dbe3e0f.jpeg) I noticed Maltodextrin is after Sodium, so each serving has 10mg minimum of Maltodextrin because there's 10mg of sodium in each serving. Preceding Maltodextrin is Calcium Phosphate, and if you look at the calcium at the bottom it says it provides 2% of the daily RDA. Under the RDA's guideline for Calcium, it says that 1300mg should be taken in daily. 2% of this 1300mg RDA 26mg.   


So if we assume there's 25mg of Maltodextrin in each serving, that would make 125mg per packet right? So a gallon=2packets = 250mg of maltodextrin. Even if I were to drink two gallons a day, that'd leave me at 500mg or half a gram of Maltodextrin (or half a carb) a day form kool-aid, right?   


Is the ill response to these powders accurate because I'm missing something? I feel like I'm not understanding a specific concept or guesstimating the right amounts of ingredients. I mean, the [Cherry Variety](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/919Gey0CqJL._SL1500_.jpg) doesn't even have Maltodextrin in it. I originally got into this because it was suggested insulin resistance (because of things like the koolaid I make) is the culprit of why the last of my lower stomach feels like its been in the ""pre-whoosh"" stage for 2 months now and has what feels like the consistency of a water bed and extremely squishy.  


Super sorry about the wall of text. I've been on a very intense cut for the last 5 months and my macros are basically forcing me to do keto as of the moment. So I'm just looking for answers :) Any input is super appreciated!"
keto,Exited keto last night. Too much dry skin and keto rash. Will try again later.,"Tbh I’ve been on and off keto for the last couple of years and just last night it dawned on me the reason I get red scaly patches on my face and dry dull skin has been due to keto (or keto rash). I couldn’t understand why eating a healthy keto diet full of fresh vegetables and lean meat along with lots of exercise and water (2-3L a day) would cause my skin to get worse. Today I’m feeling much better and my skin is already healing after eating a can of kidney beans and an apple this morning (I can feel the moisture has returned when I touch my face). 

I do miss the suppressed appetite and wired energy of keto though so I’m hoping to get back on it in a few months of trying a low calorie diet but I wonder what I can do better next time? I was already taking SALT AND MAGNESIUM supplements but that didn’t help get rid of keto rash. Last year on keto I was using the POTASSIUM salt but still had the same issues. Maybe keto rash is unavoidable???"
keto,Keto has blown my mind,"I’ve had never tried Keto before, but after a particularly bad blood sugar result my Dr advised to start Keto. In 18 days I’ve lost 14lb. But the most amazing thing that I have never experienced in the past is that I am not hungry. Prior to Keto all I would do was thing about food. I’ve done Weight Watchers, Slimming World, Noom etc and the common thread was that I was hungry constantly, sometimes to the point that I couldn’t sleep. I used to end up sneaking downstairs to secret eat. But now, nothing , no hunger, no obsessing about food. It’s an absolute revelation. I wish I’d known about this earlier."

keto,Calorie Deficit / Keto + PCOS help pls!," 

So.. I started keto last March. I lost 100 lbs in 6 months. I've been maintaining it and losing a lil more here and there. I want to lose about 50 more pounds.

My problem arises now because I've become stagnant. I've hit that pesky plateau. I was looking into calorie deficit but I'm scared because I have PCOS. Carbs/sugar don't do well in my system and I gain weight super fast. I just wanted to see, if I were to switch to a calorie deficit, would I gain weight back due to the PCOS? I know that calorie deficit works, I've seen it, but sugars/carbs don't agree with me.

I know factually, that quite a bit of the time on keto I was not in a calorie deficit - I lost a lot of weight really fast and I was eating whatever I wanted (That was keto, but portions and calories didn't matter. I was just dropping weight like crazy.) I also didn't exercise. 

Now I take walks etc and try to do what I can to help with weight loss but I've been the same weight for a few months. I'm still doing keto so it's frustrating because it's always worked for me. I wanted to see how calorie deficit would work for me (if it would) but I'm scared bc of the PCOS. It feeds and thrives with sugar in my body and I am so worried about gaining weight back. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think if I swap to CD I'll lose, regardless of PCOS?

keto,How do I know if I am in ketosis?! I don’t have any of the symptoms people get when in ketosis... no keto breath or foul smelling pee (which should be a good thing but now I’m wondering if I’m doing something wrong lol),"I’ve been staying at around 15-20 g of carbs per day max, I do know I often have issues with going a little over on my protein and under on fat, but I am also working out 5 days a week, so idk if maybe the extra protein will kick me out of ketosis as I’m sure my body needs the protein to build muscle....

I’m just curious to know how I can tell if I am in ketosis or not since I don’t have any of the usually symptoms, no keto flu, no bad breath or anything! I lost 5 pounds in the past 5-6 weeks and have been stalled for 2-3, but again I am also working out quite rigorously so maybe I’m just building muscle at the same rate I’m losing fat (I think I do notice a bit of difference in my belly looking less puffy...)

Maybe i am over thinking but I want to make sure I’m doing this right lol"
keto,Eating Out - Subway,"My husband and I live in a really small town in Wyoming. Sometimes, we just want something quick to grab after work that doesn't kill our diet.

However, when we think of healthy, we do not usually associate it with tasty. It is not easy to stick to healthy desserts and snacks, and we usually impulsively decide to grab a high-calorie snack after all.

On the 6th week I started to notice some rashes on my neck, back, and it eventually spread to my chest (keto rash). I began to have acne breakouts on my face and it just kept getting worse overtime. 

I did some research and decided to try out some bile salts like ""Super Enzyme"" on amazon. This is what made my keto rash go away over a course of 3 days. I also tried to up my carb intake to about 20-30 net grams until my rash got completely healed.

However my ance was still getting worse. For some reason, I noticed that it started breaking out ever since I stopped eating salads everyday. My face was inflammed and itchy after every meal with high fats. I was breaking out like crazy even after washing my face 2-3 times daily. I began to eat spinach, kale, mushrooms, and swiss chard every single day for every meal. After incorporating vegetables back into my diet, I began to see the acne go away significantly over 3 days.

This has worked for me and I just wanted to share this in hopes that it can work for those who are dealing with this as well."
keto,Sugar addict with gastritis - is keto worth trying?,"Hello everyone, 

I am a sugar addict, and even very dark chocolate sets me off into binging on all carbs in sight. For the past 3 months I´ve suffered BADLY from gastritis (no h. pylori or ulcers, luckily). I´ve been prescribed Esomeprazol (PPI) but I am still in great pain every day. My stomach bloats up to 6 months pregnant every time I eat. I´ve been eating meat, fish, chicken, eggs, ghee, veggies and dark chocolate. But also tried to include white rice the past few weeks, but that just makes me wired and I feel sluggish and craving even more carbs. My digestion is really slow as well. Feels like food is just sitting in my stomach. 

Is it worth going ALL IN on the keto diet to try to heal? I have been eating pretty close, but I slip up with to much dark chocolate every day, and probably eating to much protein and not enough fat. 

Please help me, I can´t deal with this pain anymore."

keto,Weight-loss benefits of being in Ketosis after initial water weight loss?,"I’ve been doing keto for a few weeks now and have had a couple of slip-ups. I’ve been on track for the past couple weeks, but I’m only losing about 2 pounds a week at this point, which I’ve read is normal.

Since your body in keto still functions on the 3500 calorie deficit=1 pound, what are the benefits of being in ketosis after the initial water weight loss? 

For example we (my husband and I) have been wanting to add legumes to our diet as well as some more fruit for the extra vitamins and health benefits. If we’re only losing the same amount as a normal CICO diet, does eating 70g-80g of carbs a day from fruit and beans make that much of a difference to weight loss?

Am I misunderstanding something?"
keto,Long Term Impact,"Hi there, 

I used the keto diet to lose quite a lot of weight a year ago. I have since fallen of the wagon but am eager to get back on. My only concern is the long term impact.

keto,"I feel way more energetic when I take an omega 3 pill, why is this ?","I eat about 100g of fat 20g carbs 70g protein. I know the portion isn’t the best.

Any ideas why ?"
keto,How long until electrolytes kick in?,"So hey guys. I've been doing keto for over a year now but I never had any issues with electrolytes until very recently. My heart started racing and my blood pressure went a bit up so I headed to the doctors and they said I had panic attacks and was diagnosed with GAD (I mean, I always knew I had it but never actually went to see a doctor about it).

They started me on citalopram and I started taking them 5 days ago but I was still a bunch of symptoms from electrolyte imbalance, such as migraines with a not exactly blurry vision but just kinda off. Don't know if that's what you guys call the ""brain fog"". I was having cramps in my legs every day I woke up and just a general feeling of unwellness. So, like 3 days ago I started on the the electrolytes but this feeling of unwellness and bit of brain fog still seem to persist, I just don't know if it's maybe the citalopram I'm taking or the electrolytes are just taking their time to kick in... Anyone can give me any pointers?"
keto,Stalled on Keto?,"It’s been nearly two weeks now and I have not lost a single pound. Prior to this I had lost nearly 10 pounds in about a month. Now, however, it seems that no matter what I do, I can’t lose weight. I even bought a keto blood meter to make sure I was in ketosis (I was).

Does anyone have any help here as I’m at a loss for what to do?"
keto,4 Kg in a 10 days any help ?," I'm not very familiar with the KETO diet, but I've noticed that there are a couple of people who may be in a similar situation as me. I won't go into much detail, I'll explain in brief. 

Due to the diagnosis of gastritis and gerd in the last 10 days I have completely changed my diet, no more junk food, no more sweets or sodas or alcoholic drinks. I lost about 4 kg in 10 days, so I was a little worried because I have stool problems (brown yellow / green) and I read that it could be something related to the pancreas. My doctor thinks it's from a change in diet, also the ultrasound didn't help much considering I was told my pancreas was poorly visualized. I wonder if I should worry or? I don't feel exhausted or lack strength, I feel good considering I've been sleeping for 3.4 hours for a while due to some obligations. Thanks

BTW:  Also, this morning on an empty stomach I weighed in at 115.5 and as soon as I drink 2.3 cups of water it went to 116.7"
keto,The effect sleep can have...,"Hello all! Just wanted a place to put this out there. Long story short, been keto before and successfully lost 30 lbs. had a baby and gained it all back, and then some. I’ve been off and on since a couple months post-partum and have just been too stressed/overwhelmed/exhausted for it to stick. Little one is almost 10 months and although teething is *killing* us right now, we’re in a decent spot. Given this, I hopped back on this past Monday and have been successful again. Lost about 5 lbs, feeling in control with only a few hard moments that I ultimately defeated. 

However, in one night I gained 3 lbs and I believe this is due to lack of sleep. I fasted until lunch, was within macros, barely over calories, was done eating by 6:45 and had a good 40 minute walk. When all of those things line up, I can expect to lose *something* based on all of my experience. Even if it’s .5 lbs. it’s something. 

Well. I gained 3.2 lbs and I can guarantee you it’s because I slept on the couch last night and got just about zero sleep. My baby girl had a rough night and when that’s the case AND my husband is home (he works nights) I will go to the couch. This is because he’s up most of the night because his own sleep is completely jacked due to work and he can’t stand to hear her cry. To honestly make it easier for everyone, I go to the living room and close the door so he can’t hear her and I don’t feel pressure to go against the sleep training I’ve successfully done with her. 

Most of the time, I don’t have that much trouble getting some sleep but last night I just couldn’t get right. Maybe some other factors contributed to the gain, but I believe this to be the biggest factor. It’s crazy how it can effect it so greatly. My husband is back at work tonight, I’ll be back in bed and hopefully baby has a better night for a happier scale in the morning, haha!"
keto,Okinawa Flat Belly Tonic Reviews: Real Weight Loss Benefits?,"The Okinawa Flat Belly Tonic is part of the extensive and constantly growing niche market for weight loss supplements. In the past decade, weight loss formulas have come to dominate the supplement market, which is worth billions of dollars globally. The United States is generally considered the biggest consumer of weight loss supplements, but much of the world harbors love for supplementation. At its core, the appeal of a weight loss pill is easy to understand. Taking a supplement can help to maximize the effectiveness of your existing weight loss routine.

Regardless of how much (or how little) you exercise, it’s always possible to improve the efficiency of your workouts and fat-burning routine. The basic outline for any weight loss process should be the creation of a caloric deficit. People who burn more calories throughout the day than they consume are bound to lose weight; this is a guarantee. However, metabolism varies from person to person. Some people seem like they can just eat all day long and never gain weight. Others just look at a piece of cake and seem to gain five pounds.

While popular media outlets may brand all weight loss supplements as scams. While we do realize that many consumers have had bad experiences in this explosive contemporary sector, some weight loss formulas are packed with efficient ingredients capable of supercharging your weight loss work. The Okinawa Flat Belly Tonic is part of this tradition; the supplement claims that it can help people of all ages and weights regain control of their diets.

The formula’s powerful ingredients have been scientifically shown to help people lose more weight. Utilizing GMP, or Good Manufacturing Practices, the company behind the Okinawa Flat Belly Tonic claims that they specially craft each bottle of their supplement for maximum effectiveness.

keto,Questions about fruits and keto,"I have been doing keto now for more than a month (I feel great) but a lot of the ingredients I see in the internet are very western based or more of the hard or extensive to buy here in the philippines (yeah, never a big fan of rice since I was a kid but it is the norm).

I am fully aware that sweet fruits are not allowed in keto but what about unripe fruits like green papaya, unripe mangos, young jackfruit, certain types of bananas and many more which are commonly available here but I am not sure if they are good for keto.

My concern is, is keto mainly avoiding sugars and carbs from sweet ripe fruits or just fruits in general? Because it would be a shame to avoid this things that are readily available here."

I’ve been keto for almost three years. I was looking through some old photos and found this gem. I was close to my heaviest weight of about 307 pounds. Every birthday that passes I feel healthier, stronger, and more alive than ever! For me the benefits of keto are more than just aesthetic. I can tie my own shoes, get out of bed with ease, walk long distances, stand for hours, run, do HITT exercises, get proper sleep, and the list goes on and on. Point being yes I love the physical changes, but everything else is what drives me to stay keto!"

keto,3 month update: 52.4 lbs lost,"After years of being ""big"", I got tired of my feet hurting all the time. Figured my weight had some role in that so I started looking into keto after a niece had some success with it. I have a job that keeps me in the car most of the day and was eating fast food almost every day.  I had no idea my current weight because my wife's bathroom scale wouldn't go that high. Was guessing I was around 325-330. Started researching the diet, read the FAQ, tried a few recipes, and ordered a new scale. It arrived on the evening of 12/28. I weighed myself after dinner (I know) and was surprised to see I was 350.6 lbs! Yes, I needed to lose weight. 

I officially started keto on 1/1/21 at 343.4lbs. I initially bought way too much food because I wasn't yet sure how much I'd eat on a given day. I know the recommendation is to do a 20% deficit, but I went with 35% and have maintained that throughout. That gives me a low fat macro and about 1500 calories per day (now). That's a big step down from before when I'd sometimes have 4000 calories in one meal (I'm not kidding).  I started with simple meals. Eventually tried a few recipes - some I liked and some I didn't. I've now gotten into a pretty good routine and vary my dinners through different meats and veggies while keeping brunch about the same each day. 

I've had a few week-long stalls along the way. I don't eat out hardly at all anymore and when I do it usually leads to a slight weight gain despite reading menu nutrition charts and keeping my numbers down. After one fairly long stall I decided to try a fast (only water) - 11pm Sunday to 2pm Tuesday - and that helped a lot to get it started again. 

On 4/1 I weighed 291 lbs! No April Fools there! If I can keep up the 15-lb/mo loss rate, then I'll be at my initial goal of 210 by Halloween. According to the height/weight charts, my ideal weight is about 180 lbs. Not sure if that's doable or desired, but I'll decide when I get close to the first goal. 

For a long time I made excuses that dieting cost too much because healthy food costs more than unhealthy food and I'm not wealthy. It's cheaper to buy a pack of hot dogs and a box of mac n cheese than broccoli and chicken. Well, that's true, but I've found I have more money in the bank now than I did then. I might go spend $150 at the grocery store (usually less) but then I feed myself two meals per day for two weeks or more. Compare that to a $15 (or more) every day in the drive thru (for one meal) in the same timeframe at $210+.

I've finally convinced my wife to try it as she's been wanting to lose some weight (5'0"" at 127 lbs) and she started on 4/1 at a 20% deficit. She committed to 30 under 20 for now, then she'll decide if she wants to continue. She's a big bread, chocolate, and milk fan so I'm finding some subs for her.

Anyhoo... I'm pleased with the progress so far. I've gone down 2 pants sizes and am close to going down another. Had to buy a new belt. My seatbelt isn't as tight as it used to be. And my feet still hurt some, but not as bad or as often as before."
keto,Random Glucose/ Insulin Blood Test NSV,"I have been working with a weight management doctor and after losing 45lbs in about 5 months (SW 257, CW 213) he ordered a series of blood tests to check on how I was doing with keto and in terms of health— the main reason for wanting to lose! The NSV I have to share is that my random glucose test came back as 1 microunit per milliliter. This test measures the amount of insulin in the body. The normal range for this test is largely debated, but clearly I am nice and low and keto is working, suggesting true lipolysis (breakdown of stored fat!)"
keto,I did the egg “fast” to restart my keto journey last week.,"Let me preface with: I know it’s not really a fast. 

I did this to restart keto after several months of falling off and getting back on the wagon. I struggle with meal planning, I like eggs well enough, and this was just *easy.*

I ate nothing but eggs and fat for three days. I either scrambled eggs in a tablespoon of butter for each egg, or ate a tablespoon of MCT oil for every poached or fried or boiled egg. I wasn’t able to do the full six eggs and six tablespoons of fat daily, I usually maxed out at four each. I had a bit of Babybel cheese on the side to have texture. 

Day two I mistrusted a fart, but it was just a poot. Day three my butthole got fried by all the liquid coming through it, repeatedly. Disgustingly, it was yellowish, and smelled a bit like eggs. 

I lost 7.5 lbs (water weight most likely) but now can’t even think about eggs for awhile without feeling queasy. 

Next time I feel the need to do something like this, I’ll probably just regular fast instead."
keto,I've got 80kg (175lbs) to lose...has anyone here lost that much?,"I'm \~15kg into my journey and this month my weight plateaued for the first time for 30 days and to be honest it's scared the hell out of me. 

In the support groups I'm in (outside Reddit) it feels like I have more to lose than anyone else. Everyone else seems to have so much less to lose (most want to lose up to 30-45kg (66-100lbs)) and their advice/experience is often so different to mine and doesn't help me as much as I'd like because someone of my size has different issues (physically/mentally/emotionally) to face. It's extremely difficult to explain the differences to them because they just aren't this big and it's usually very small differences so they brush it off as insignificant (it's not to me) and that makes me feel very alienated.

So I really could use some exposure to first hand experiences and reassurance from people who've lost **at least 70kg/150lbs**...if that's you it would mean a lot if you could talk to me and answer some of my questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. How much did you lose and how long did it take you? What type of keto (dirty/strict/lazy/clean) and was it only keto or did you do other things to help along the way?
2. How has maintenance been if you're there? Did you transition to another way of eating? Did things get harder as you approached your goal weight?
3. Do you work out? When did you decide to start working out and for what reasons?
4. When did you start noticing you were actually getting smaller? Specifically in the belly region which is so far the least changed part of me measurement wise.
5. Is there anything you wished you knew when you started that would have made things easier for you to lose weight or keep it off? 
6. What was your biggest struggle? How did you face plateaus and days where you just felt like it was impossible to get to/be your goal? I don't often struggle with this but when I do it's very hard because I don't know many people who have this much to loose, so I can't look to them and say they did it I can too.
7. Did you have insulin resistance and if so did it clear up or are you still watchful? Is there anything health wise I should be watchful for while losing weight? I've already lost my gallbladder (due to disease long ago), and I'm trying to ensure that I'm losing fat not muscle but if you have tips for that I'd appreciate them you might know something I don't."

keto,Really sad about today can anyone give me tips please?,"Really sad about today.

Yesterday I had a massive fall out with my family which was their fault. Today after a 12 hour shift they gave me more crap.

I ended up leaving the house and going to the supermarket and buying a cake and ate around 98g in carbs before throwing it away.

I say there crying in tears primarily due to what my family did but also how I failed keto. I was doing so well my back pain went away and now I’m feeling awful. 

I’ve noticed when I stress or depressed or sad I end up eating bad and this happens a lot with my family so I don’t know what to do to stop me messing up on Keto"
keto,A week in on Keto-Is it ok to fill in protein with a can of tuna?,"So I decided to go Keto! So far I feel fantastic. Intensely limiting carbs and focusing on protein seems to have been the missing link in my life for the past decade. At 30 I feel better than I ever did at 20.

Ahem, anyway. I've normally been eating bacon and eggs (mixed with cheddar cheese and a 5 oz can of tuna) for breakfast and boneless skinless chicken breast for dinner with broccoli. I'm doing ""lazy Keto"" to start just to kind of see what happens. However, the combination of what is above gets me right near my protein goal, mainly helped due to the chicken breast. However, today I got sick of chicken and made something else, instead with ground beef. This of course has lowered my protein intake.

So my question is, I'm really full, but of course I don't want to let myself go below my protein goal. Is it ok to fill in what protein is left with another 5 oz can of tuna? I really love tuna, and I buy half of my cans in oil for the fat and half in water for just this occasion. But I guess it just feels kinda weird to keep on eating. Is the tuna an ok way to fill it in? Or is it better to go a different route? Thank you!"
keto,Keto - Round 2 Harder?,"Hello everyone!  A couple of years ago I did keto and was very successful with it. I ended up getting pregnant and was not able to continue keto through my pregnancy.  I got back down to my previous weight pretty fast and have managed to not gain it back through calorie counting and exercise.  I started the keto diet back because I would love to lose another 30 lbs , but I am finding that this time around I’m not losing at the speed I was before.  My weekly losses are either 1-2 lbs or nothing at all.  I track all of my carbs and stay under 20 and I pretty much am eating the exact same foods I did my first round.  Is it harder to do keto the second time around?  If it helps, I did my first round of keto about 3 years ago and did it for almost a year."

keto,Ive stalled and have a couple of questions,"So I've been on the Keto diet for getting close to a month now. I started at 225 (I'm 5'9 M), and at the start I was losing weight quite quickly. In the first 15 days, I lost 10 lbs. After that, my weight loss has stalled. I got down to 211 and now haven't lost weight for about 2 weeks. I haven't cheated at all, and I'm doing the exact same thing I was doing at the start. My tests say I'm in ketosis but obviously they aren't 100% . I eat basically the same amount of food every single day. A couple hamburgers with cheese, a hotdog or 2 and a decent sized salad with ham ,boiled egg, cheese with a drizzle of ranch. I calculated how many calories each meal was around 1700 calories (20% deficit). With around 40-50 carbs per day. But I also eat only one meal a day, two if I'm really hungry. 

1.  Do I need to do less carbs per day?

2. Is it better to eat one big meal a day with all of your calories and carbs in that meal (sort of intermittent fast) or have multiple meals a day with obviously less calories and carbs in each meal? 

3. Also, is eating the same exact food every single day bad? Does your body get use to it? 

Thank you in advance :)"

keto,"Was on ""Keto"" for a month but did not lose any weight. Was I doing something wrong?","So since March I've been on or at least tried to be on a keto diet. My house is a typical asian household where carbs are everywhere and is the main source of energy here so I didn't have a lot of keto friendly choices. I've been counting my daily carb intake and to be safe kept it under 20 grams everyday but I'd have some snacks at night which I still counted but I didn't think much of it. There'd be some days where I'd be like ah fuck it ill just go under 30 and ate some foods with some carbs but still trying to count it and make sure I wasn't going over. Prior to this diet I have tried countless times going keto but failing to maintain the diet within the first week but this time I really tried it since the first time I did it, I was on it for a month and lost at least 20 pounds but this time it didn't work. I weighed myself at 220 at the start and at the end only weighed in about 218. There were some times where I didn't know the carb count of some foods and I just ate it hoping it did not knock me off keto like at the last week I ate a dozen wings which had some breading on it. I don't know keto stopped working for me cos of the many times I've tried to be on it and didn't maintain it or I've just been eating the wrong foods at the wrong amount and at the wrong time. I've done my research and the next time I try a keto diet I will go on a calorie deficit with intermittent fasting. I'm really tryna cut down before the middle of the year. Any tips?"
keto,"Lost over 100lbs on keto, next steps? Surgury?","Hey everyone!  Well, I (33/F/164cm/SW: 300lbs CW:175lbs) have been on keto since February of 2019... I started at around 300lbs and I have been slowly working my way down.  I think I may be the only person I know who didn't gain weight during the strict quarantine here, but I didn't lose much during those months either to be fair.  I have been going pretty slow, in the last 5 or so months I added in intermittent fasting but generally speaking, I just lose weight slowly and I am OK with that.  I have always weighed a lot, when I am stick thin I weigh 165 pounds, I mean I am happy to lose another 10 pounds give or take but I am not fussed about it.  I am happy with my body where I am at.  I had sort of hoped that losing so slowly and using ample cream (and I mean seriously, I could not be more effing hydrated), would aid in not having so much loose skin, and maybe it did, but not enough... My loose skin is an actual problem.

This is going to be so much TMI, but we're all in the same boat here right?  My loose skin is a hygiene problem.  As we're getting into the warmer months here, I am struggling to keep under the flaps of skin dry, like we’re one hot month away from there being a smell situation.  My belly button is already questionable.  I don’t know how to talk about this with people I know, so I turned to the internet like everyone else does.  I'd like to think that if it were just an aesthetics thing, I would be happier with the situation, but I am honestly not sure how long I would be willing to play Tetris with skin to put on clothes before I considered surgery even without the present hygiene issue.  I know many people who lost more weight than I did and didn’t end up with as much, I suppose everyone is different.  I'm not unhappy with my body per se...  But it's hard to be super excited about losing 100 pounds and buying your first bikini when you have to do a puzzle of how to place your skin inside it every time.

But I want to know, has anyone here considered surgery?  Have you gotten it?  What should I expect?  What are some things you’re curious about if you haven’t had it? Or if you’ve had it, what things do you wish you had known beforehand?"

-91g fats

keto,Weird NSV - I fainted! - an SV - and a good NSV.,"Two days ago I fainted *(weird NSV)* after working out! Which *normally would be concerning, BUT...*

I had just weighed myself right before showering, and was trying to get a non-compromising photo of my scale *(which I have learned is unnecessarily reflective),* because I am finally back in the 250s *(that's the SV, and 259.4 counts as ""250s""! - and today was 258.2)* ~~for the first time in a couple years~~ for the fist time in 5 years. I stood up WAY too fast, felt dizzy, and was suddenly knocking over the towel rack, bruising my knee, and lying on the floor thinking I was having a stroke.

After standing back up, and checking that both halves of my face were still mobile, I realized I had fainted and that it might be time to check on my Blood Pressure meds to see about lowering them.

SO, today I saw my Dr. and we're starting to reduce the meds *(the good NSV)* with the goal of eliminating them in the near future, because I keep getting readings of 100/60 the last few weeks.

While I was there, we discussed that I'm on Keto - she was fine with it, but not a huge fan, but didn't cast any shade on it. We're checking my A1C, Cholesterol (the regular panel), Liver and Kidney function, and I'm pretty sure Potassium\* too. Will update in a couple days with how those turn out.

Also, I wore pants to the doctor that I bought over a year ago, that were ""my size"" but which I couldn't get on, and now they fit great!

*\*One of my BP meds is Lisinopril, which is known to raise blood potassium levels. So I've been reluctant to add it to my diet.*

***TL:dr - Passed out because my blood pressure is running low due to weight loss, and now I get to lower my meds, and in a few months probably get off them completely.***"

keto,2 MONTHS ON KETO,"Hello, today I just finished my 2nd month on keto. I started 2021 February 1 and I started at 349lb and today 2021 April 1 I am now 49lb lighter and weighing in at 300. My goal weight is 220 so there is still a long way to go but this month ive really pushed my limits and kicked a lot of craves and its really showing with the results. I eat less then 20 carbs a day and walk atleast 1 mile. This thread has been very helpful and has helped me a lot and this is my second post lol. EVERYONE KEEP IT UP AND REMEMBER WHY YOU STARTED!!!!"
keto,Would drinking a lot of water after eating carbs reduce the chance of breaking ketosis?,"Example. Drinking a glass of juice and than drinking 3 glasses of water, would the extra water dilute the juice enough... Or maybe something like 2 slices of pizza and than chug a bunch of water. Is it possible to work?"
keto,How to make ketones higher...less protein or,I have ketones of .7. I eat less than 5 carbs from trace amounts in meat that is it. Does ketosis get deeper by limiting protein? Does increasing fat increases ketones? Does exercising increase ketones? I haven’t had a carb in 1 year of carnivore/keto but my ketones are usually .4 from so much protein. I’m trying to do more traditional keto macros now for hormones and better satiety glucose and appetite control. Will upping fat alone increase ketones or is it all about lowering protein? Does fat have any effect on ketones?
keto,A little inside help understanding this,"Hey I’ve recently been discharged from the hospital from an unrelated matter and I noticed this on my urine sample.  

I’m not diabetic however any insight on these test results would be really helpful. 

Thank you again 

[Test Results ](https://ibb.co/Hr6JJJv)"
keto,Which carb counters are free and understand grams?,"The FAQ lists 4 carb counters.  Carb Manager, the first one, when I attempted to enter my 150g of broccoli had no grams unit, nor indeed \*any\* weight unit.   In my book it's not a serious player if you can't weigh it.    


I'm currently trying cronometer.  It's web site version at least understood what a gram and an oz. were.  

Senza and the fourth one just looked stupid on the web page, and doesn't really have a web interface.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'd like to be able to do is actually track what I've eaten.  E.g.  What have I eaten this MONTH?  What do not get enough of?    


What other good carb trackers are there, preferably ones that can export a spreadsheet compatible format?"
keto,OMAD question,"So I’m thinking of trying OMAD.  I’ve done IF 16/8, and even a couple 36 hour fasts...

For OMAD, do you just have one huge meal?  All your calories/carbs/protein....in one sitting?
Seems like a huge meal to eat at one time?"
keto,see below,"started on 29th of March, have I entered ketosis? If so, when do I start to lose weight?

rlly not sure about this. Since it takes 2-7 days it’s definitely possible, but I’m not sure. My fatigue only lasted a day, unless you count feeling more tired than usual before bed (usually fell asleep at 2:00 am, fell asleep at like 1:00 or midnight). I’m not sure if I have broken my fast or my system has (hopefully) gone into ketosis"
keto,"Questions about electrolytes, dehydration etc.","I have been on keto now for only two days, but I felt ketosis coming very quickly. Mental energy is at the top, physical energy varies depending on factors. Since I started OMAD at the same time as keto, I rarely ever have any energy when trying to work out. But I realize that my body just needs to adapt. Overall I feel great.

But a few things worry me. First of all, I experience muscle cramps and somewhat of a headache unless I drink salt water every two hours. I bought some electrolyte powder as well with sodium, magnesium, potassium and sodium. I feel really great after taking that stuff, and I feel like I need to take it probably 3 times per day, and I wouldn't say that I'm really that active right now. I know that you urinate a lot on keto and electrolyte imbalances are a pretty common thing, but my question is; 

**1) Do I need to replenish these amounts of electrolytes all the time when I'm on keto, or does my body kind of adapt to it after a few weeks?** I know it doesn't really work that way, but I figure the body must find a system to kind of keep things in needs, and not flush it, right? I mean I must take a lot of electrolytes just to try to prevent my muscles from twitching. And my joints from hurting and getting stiff.

**2) Does the diarrhoea subside when my body gets fat adapted?** At least yesterday, I had to shit water at least 3 times after my meal. I realize that it's a common side effect during the initial stages of ketosis (or during ""keto flu""), but the body adapts to it, right? I've got some probiotic pills at home, which only usually makes me need to shit more and not necessarily make it better, but I can try those. I ate some saurkraut today with my meal and I hope that it makes some difference. I think there were some undigested pieces today too, yellow/dark yellow pieces, circa 0,5 cm/0,2"".

**3) What are the general symptoms of being dehydrated, except for being thirsty?** Can dehydration cause muscle twitches too etc?

**4) How long time does it take before I can get a little bit of physical energy to work out?** I must be very careful right now, a little too much and I just get generally drained. I don't think working out really is a good idea right now, since I might have muscle catabolism if I do so.

**5) Is a high conjugated bilirubin level bad in combination with keto?** I saw on my recent blood test that I had a pretty high conjugated bilirubin level. All the other liver enzyme levels etc were all fine. But is this worries me slightly, since the liver is part of what metabolizes fat, or the primary part  in the process. I figure that I feel fine in general at least mentally, and no real abnormal colours of urine or stool, so I should be fine, right?"
keto,"Severe Crohn's &amp; autoimmune disorder, are these foods enough for keto?","As a preface, I have a rare form of Crohn's (orofacialgranulomatosis, or OFG for short). It's teetering on the edge of developing into bowel Crohn's, but the condition inevitably develops regardless... Unless keto can stop this? I also suffer from asthma, hayfever, coffee/caffeine allergy, and various other immune related illnesses. 

I did keto for 6 months straight a couple of years back, felt great, but then relapsed due to the food I was eating on keto conflicting with Crohn's. All that changed when a suspected heart attack (I was only 27) turned out to be severe heart inflammation, caused by the mature cheeses and cured meats I was using as snacks. 

After that I've been eating clean meats, dairy, fats, leafy greens etc, but constantly been in and out of illnesses, fevers, etc. 

Long story short, I've found the root of the problem years late, coffee! It has seriously been messing me up to the point where I developed a fistula, the dreaded beginning of Crohn's. It still hasn't been fixed after 2 years, although the pandemic didn't help. 

My question is, am I able to live healthily on keto if my diet consists of meat, leafy greens like broccoli, butter, and peppers/onions/asparagus for flavouring? I can add macadamia nuts in too for a snack, as they are well tolerated. 

I have ketoaide supplemented to make up the minor shortcomings when it comes to electrolytes too, and the food itself is well salted. 

Each day has around 100g of butter total added to meals, in addition to using fatty meats such as chicken thigh and beef shin. It's also the only way I can add variety by switching meats. 

Sorry for the long post, but if I eat this way in addition to keeping on top of electrolytes and supplements, I should be fine right?

Symptoms of my illnesses have reduced significantly since switching to clean fresh foods and avoiding fermented products such as coffee and cured meat. I just want to make sure I won't be killing myself by eating like this!

Thank you in advance lovely people :)"
keto,Do you really lose more weight on keto? Or do you lose the same amount of weight just being in a calorie deficit?,"I’m (25 F) trying to lose 30 pounds by the end of June (I’m currently 167, the heaviest I’ve ever been). Today’s April 1st, I have 3 months. Is it possible? Do you really lose more weight on keto or would I lose just as much weight just being on a calorie defect? Also how many calories should I eat to reach my goal weight?"
keto,I’m finally doing it,"Hey you guys! I recently decided that I would try the keto diet. I’ve had a really unhealthy relationship with food for a while, and a friend of mine recommended trying keto. My father is also struggling with his weight and my mother wants to lose weight as well. We’re all going to do it together, and I’m very excited. Any recipes or ideas would be greatly appreciated, and I look forward to this journey!"
keto,Having surgery while in ketosis,"My partner is having double groin surgery tomorrow and has been in ketosis for about one month. The doctors and surgeons haven't mentioned anything and I'm not sure if he had this conversation with them. Should there should be any concern for recovery while on a keto diet? 

 I know protein is the best healer for surgery, and we have plenty of meats and spinach to go around. 

Does anyone have a suggestions or advice? 

Thanks"
keto,Update plus face gains!!,"[Update](https://imgur.com/gallery/wROScxF)

Journey so far. I started keto on 12-2019, I was 326 lbs and noticed my quality of life was poor. I went to a Dr who does medically supervised weight loss and I knew if I followed his instructions I would have success. I already knew lots about it, but he taught me all about the keto diet and told me to follow the carb/protein/fat numbers he set for me, and gave me basically a large FAQ folder to take with me. For the first couple months I saw him every two weeks, with weigh ins that provided a printout of my progress with nifty little graphs and all. We would talk about what kinds of things I was eating, how I was feeling, etc. and would be a coach/counselor/cheerleader. Once I was adapted to the lifestyle we moved to 3 weeks between appointments. I looked forward to my time with him and tried to avoid weighing myself outside of his office so it felt like a treat to see my new number. Once I had lost a good amount of weight, and my energy was high, he got me to start working out. I got a gym membership and was going 3-4 days a week!  I loved my gym days and was shocked that it had taken me so long to go. Everything was going perfect, then, Covid. I was actually at the gym when I got the text that they would be closing indefinitely in a few hours. No biggie, I went to the store on my way home to buy resistance bands medicine balls among other things to work out in my garage. I got everything set up, and never used it once. Going to my garage to work out didn’t have the same feel of going to the gym, and I just couldn’t do it. It’s ok though, I’ll just stick to the diet. By this time, no in person Dr appointments allowed. So I could no longer weigh in and get my cool graphs. I tried zoom style appointments but it wasn’t the same. I kept eating keto and on April 30, 2020 I was 262 lbs. 64 pounds lost in less than 5 months!!!! Incredible!!!  Well that was the lowest number I would see on the scale. I slowly started cheating here and there, mostly for comfort in this crazy new world we were in. Before long I was 100% off keto. For a long time I stayed pretty close to my lowest weight, I had learned about portion control, only eating when I needed to and stopping when my body told me to. Eventually I fell back into over eating, eating for fun, and comfort, and to satiate boredom. Pounds started rising and me new clothes got tight. I didn’t step on a scale for a long time. 1-1-2021, I stepped on a scale...312.  I was so upset and disappointed, I promised myself I would never go back to where I started. The next morning, I was 100% keto! I dropped down to 295 quick, and stayed there, for about 3 weeks. What was I doing wrong?  I soon realized I was using all the “keto” “low carb” products from the grocery store. I cut those all out and went back to basics. Meat, cheese, eggs, avocado, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts. That’s it, only thing I will put in my body. Today I am 272 and 10 lbs away from my first goal of getting back to where I was a year ago. I am hoping to hit my goal of 262 by April 30, the date I hit 262 last year.  I just want to end by saying thank you to everyone who shares their stories here. I read them often and you all give me tons of motivation. Sorry for the long post, but it’s been a long journey so far. Have a great day, and thanks for listening!!"
keto,Anyone tried ice cream from Killer Creamery?,"My local grocery store just started carrying this brand. They use allulose, which seems to be generating a good bit of buzz because of its properties for the ketogenic lifestyle. The nutrition labels are a little more confusing, as allulose seems to be counted as a carb in the label, but it is not a sugar alcohol, so it's not listed under sugar alcohols in the nutrition label. But, I think they are supposed to be about 2 g net carbs (subtracting out the allulose) which puts them on par with Rebel from a nutritional perspective."
keto,Is my scale broken?,"A short backstory

I’m bigger so weighing myself has never been high on my to do list. The last time I knew my weight was when I went to the doctor for a checkup about 6 months ago. 

I started Keto 6 weeks ago and I’m loving it so far. When I started I did not intend on using my scale since I figured my goal would be “drop a shirt/pant size” rather than numbers. But I’ve been feeling so good that I decided to break out the scale about a month in. I was down 30 pounds from my last known weight. And I’ve been weighing every week and now I’m down 44 pounds according to my scale but my clothes still basically fit the same. The pants are a little looser but that’s it. 

Is this normal? Should I try a different scale?

FYI, SW:400 CW:356 GW: 250. 
&lt;20 carbs/day."
keto,"Exactly 3 months in, I have lost 20lbs, and I have repatriated in Onderland!!","I am below 200lbs for the first time in 22 years! The last 10 days have been especially amazing for me.

I am so excited to see strong progress lately. [As I mentioned in my 3-months-in (well, just short of 3 months) first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/mce27a/my_keto_journey_thus_far_3_months_in_long/) in /r/keto, I had experienced. pretty strong progress though with some periods of frustrating (though expected, per the FAQ) slow loss. I recently realized, however, that I was probably sabotaging my progress somewhat; despite being fairly strict and tracking my intake somewhat regularly, I was eating unaccounted-for nuts and breaking my intermittent-fasting with late-night Scotch (double-whammy, calories + the interrupted IF). Needless to say I wasn't adding those nuts or drinks to my log in MFP.

Starting on 3/21 I started tracking every nut (in addition to everything else I'm eating) and stopped drinking as much, and definitely no more IF-busting drinks. The nut-tracking isn't as bad as it sounds - using my scale I know that 2 toasted pecans is about 5g, and 2 almonds is about 2g, so it's fairly easy to track that in MFP in my head now without the scale.

Coincidence or not, you can see a marked improvement in the rate of loss since 3/21, really kicking in on 3/26 where the weight started falling off. The only thing I really changed was what I mentioned above. **That's almost 5lbs in the 10 days since 3/25!** 

My caloric intake is lower since 3/21 overall, but I'm still hitting my protein macro of about 120g/day

Thanks to /r/keto! It's great to see everyone else's  struggles and triumphs, and posting helps me stay accountable to myself.

\[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/tNeBW6y.png](https://i.imgur.com/tNeBW6y.png)) See the last 33 days

\[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/7ZJjBNP.png](https://i.imgur.com/7ZJjBNP.png)) See the full 3 months progress. I would say on average, prior to 3/21 you could add 100-300 calories a day of untracked booze and nuts."
keto,"Leg cramping on Keto and I've tried electrolytes with no success. ""HELP""",I've been on Keto now for just over a month and the only issue which I've come across in the 4 weeks is extreme leg cramps.

keto,Keto is so tiring,"It's been a month. I lost 7kg. Yeah, it's working. But I'm in a horrible, horrible mood.

Cooking this stuff sucks fucking ass. We've thrown away so much food it's not even funny.

Tons of recipes out there, and so far every one we've tried tastes like absolute garbage, other than the steak &amp; veggies which is chasing me in my nightmares by now.  Prime example this morning: ""Keto Spaetzle"". Either you get a crumbly mess, or you get an undefineable slimey mass and it all falls apart when you taste it. We've tried 5 different recipes. They're all trash.

And don't get me started on Keto Pizza. Dude, that ain't no fucking pizza - it's an insult to pizzas if you call that garbage a fucking pizza. It's hideous, rubbery, tasteless.

Even something as simple as a iced chocolate. You can't get it to taste decently. Yes, we've tried all the weird named artificial sweeteners we could find (Stevia, Monk Fruit, Eryth-whatever, etc). 90% of them cause my ass to explode like I've eaten a boatload of Haribo sugar free (duh!). How the fuck are you allowed to sell that garbage.

Oh, and all that Keto ""Dream"" Chocolate Cakes or whatever - if people call that a dream I don't even know what to say anymore. It's a fucking dream alright. A bloody nightmare, is what it is.

I'm starting to feel like a hype vegan nutjob creating all kinds of fake shit and pretending it's real food. 

How are you supposed to do this? Is this just something for people that don't care what their food tastes like?"
keto,Question about magnesium biglycinate,"Hello everyone! I just bought magnesium biglycinate pills and the bottle tells me they have 225mg of magnesium per 3 capsules. How is the best way to take them? Should I go for 4 pills at once before bed or take them throughout the day?

keto,Counting calories burned on app,The lose it app and my cardio machines never seem to match calories burned.  For example I’ll do 30 on recumbent bike and burn 200 while the Lose it app says I burned 150.   Do I go by my equipment or do I go by the app?
keto,Weird sensation in throat after eating meal?,"Hey guys

So for lunch I just had a plate of boiled chicken, sauerkraut, kale, avocado and a frittata (eggs + small amount potatoes + red bell pepper) and while feeling quite full and satisfied, after 10mins or so when sitting down it kinda feels like acid reflux, but I don't really understand how this could be possible after 10min?  
I'm not 'tasting' it, but rather a feeling of hunger (but I feel full?) coming up till my throat. I'm using a standing desk by the way now, and no issues then. Only when sitting. 

I did get a stool test few days ago and results came in: carbs and proteins are not being digested properly (food could be found in my stools) and there's a lack of pancreas functioning which results in my liver working way too hard for what it should be. I did get yellowy stool in January, but since then.. just light coloured.   


Could it be that I'd need bile supplements? My naturopath prescribed me digestive enzymes and I also need to take a few natural treatments for my leaky gut.   
Recap of supplements: zinc, digestive enzymes, magnesium and probiotics for the intestines. 

I know I should be seeing this with a doctor, but I just find it weird my naturopath not suggesting something to support the liver/pancreas. :D

Thanks!"
keto,KETO &amp; Exercise,"Hi,

Like many others I've been doing pretty much zero exercise throughout the lockdowns and currently sticking to the below macros:

**FAT &amp; PROTEIN** \- 115-125g (usually around 63% FAT and 28% PROTEIN)  
**CARBS** \- 15g-20g  
**KCAL -** 1600

My BMR is 1727, I'm 187lb, 36 years old, 182cm. I'm now looking at introducing quite heavy exercise three times a week - likely burning between 800 and 1200 calories each time. The obvious principle would be to eat more calories on my exercise days but is this necessary? It would be difficult to take onboard those additional calories whilst staying in my MACROS and not completely changing my meal plans. As my calorie deficit is relatively small as it is, should I just continue as is?

Thanks in advance,

Ryan"
keto,Carbs that aren't fiber or sugar?,"Sometimes I'll notice carbs listed that even after subtracting sugar alcohols and fiber are super high. From what I've read these are polysaccharides (I think)...is this just natural carbs in certain foods?  


I've been avoiding anything like that, and did last time I was on keto as well, but just am very curious about it.  


Thanks!"
keto,NSV: Korean Edition,"
Okay, quickest backstory: obese my whole adult life. In 2014-2016, I had lost 60lbs/27kg with Keto. (You can see in my post history how well I had done once). Moved to Korea in 2016, gained everything back plus a little more (and hypothyroidismㅠㅠ)

Anyway!

Since March 2020, I started fixing my habits again. I’ve been Keto since November 2020!

As of today, I’ve lost 63lbs/28.5kg! I’m 7lbs away from getting back to my low weight a few years ago, but still have much more to lose from there.

BUT THE NSV is something I could only feel in Korea...!!

Koreans are quite... truthful lol when it comes to weight. Sometimes brutally honest ㅋㅋ They are also just generally thinner, and there’s a high expectation for appearances here. So being obese in a country like Korea has been extra rough on my self-esteem (but I’m working through that, don’t worry!). I’m still AT LEAST 54lbs/24.4kg away from a “healthy” weight. So I didn’t expect comments for a while, but good lord at least I’m feeling amazing again, finally. 


I catch the bus to work in the morning and always wait with a middle-aged woman who lives near me. I’m talking over 4 years of us waiting together. She doesn’t speak English, and I speak kindergarten Korean at best. I understand more than I can say, but we always manage to have little “chats”. She takes care of me like picking cat hairs off my shirts, holding an umbrella over me, etc. It’s a cute relationship we have!

This week, she asks me (always in Korean) if I’ve lost weight!! I was SHOCKED she noticed AND said something! I told her how much, explained “no carbs” and “no exercise yet” haha. She was amazed. Today (a few days later), she said again how pretty I look and then tells me she didn’t eat carbs for dinner this week and she is happy she’s no longer bloated! I INSPIRED MY MIDDLE-AGED KOREAN BUS AUNTIE!

THEN. Tonight, I pop into my local convenience store. The woman who works there has witnessed first hand my absolutely horrendously trash diet for years. Carbs, microwave meals, crisps, bottles of wine... I don’t go in as often anymore because I cook at home and don’t drink right now. But I needed paper towels. 

Again, she does not speak English and I do not speak nearly enough Korean. But she asks me if I’ve lost weight!! And again, I tell her how much and that I eat Keto and she’s amazed and so kind and complimentary. 

I know I’m still obese. I stand out as a foreigner anyway, never mind being overweight. But like... my Korean neighbours are noticing and are proud of me. Despite the language barrier, they are making effort to comment! None of my Korean co-workers have commented yet. I’m curious when or if... haha. 

Also, bonus NSV: I just want to give myself props for finally taking the time to commit to learning how to do Keto long-term in Korea. I did it! I get it now! It’s actually become intuitive for me and that feels great.


TL;DR: I just cannot believe my Korean locals are commenting and complimenting me  ㅠㅠ"
keto,Carnivore/keto agrees with me. How much calf liver should I eat a month?,"I'm not strict, but carbs bloat me and my diet is mostly beef, eggs and some cheese.

I found calf liver at the supermarket.  It comes frozen in 4oz individual packs of four.

I found that it's really good when I add it to about a pound of beef lightly sautéed/fried in butter till the water is gone, it's sizzling and a little browned.  I cube all the meat first.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, what's a good amount to eat every month?

And what's the next organ meat I should add to my diet?"

keto,Blood work before keto - unexpected results? need help for interpretation,"Hello!   
I did keto \~3,5 years ago and went very well for me.  
In the last 2 years i've been eating a lot of junk food and got around \~118kg (195cm height - 22 yrs old) and now i want to go back to keto to regulate my weight and fix my lifestyle.

I did a blood test today to have a reference point before starting but the results are pushing me back a bit. I was reading  about cholesterol stuff but i didn't really found a clear answer for my situation.

So, my lipidic profile is the following:

**Lipids** 681 mg/dL  - optimal level between 400 - 700   
**VLDL** 35 mg/dL  - optimal level &lt; 30   
**TG** 176  mg/dL - optimal level &lt; 150, borderline 150-199, high &gt; 200  
**LDL** 124,7  mg/dL - optimal level &lt; 100, near normal limit 100-129, borderline 130-150, high &gt; 160  
**HDL-C** 36.2 mg/dL - low &lt; 40,ideal &gt;= 60  
**CHOL** 184.5 mg/dL - optimal &lt;200, borderline : 200-240, high &gt; 240  

This leads to a TG:HDL ratio of **almost 5** which is close to very bad from what i know. How close is this linked to junk food and how fast can you decrease it?  
Should I lower TG/increase HDL before starting keto? is this high because i'm kinda fat right now (**31 BMI**) and it will level down with time?  
Should i start keto at all at this point?

I would also consult a medic for bloodwork interpretation.  


Waiting for your advice and thanks!"
keto,Struggling with 20g net carbs,"Hi, I started my keto diet 3 days ago and I'm having a hard time staying at or below 20g of net carbs. I'm using fatsecret to track my net carbs and I've been getting around 25g-30g of net carbs per day but I'm really struggling to get it down to or under 20. As a result, I find myself worrying that the diet won't be effective/I won't reach ketosis/etc. Perhaps worse, I'm avoiding vegetables (even green leafy ones) to try and get below the 20g even though they have lots of nutrients.

A little about me: I'm a 32 year old man who is 6'2"" and 350ish lbs. I've lost weight in the past using IIFYM but put it back on when I quit paying attention to my diet. My wife and I decided to do keto together so we could get healthy and lose weight. I'm finding that cheese, lunch meat, broccoli, lettuce, beef jerky, nuts, etc all have net carbs and even though it's only 2g-4g for each item, that seems to add up really quickly. I'm trying to follow the diet and so far it's not going to bad, but I can't figure out how to get at or below 20g of net carbs per day. Does anyone have advice or experience with this?"
keto,"Out of Keto, going back in","Hi all, I did keto for about 25 days along with 20/4 fasting. My ketones were well above.). The results were great and extremely encouraging. I lost about 12-15lbs and BF went down to about 14.3% ( I’m a 6 foot 28m). This past week, I had to go into my old college town and get some stuff done and visit friends.

This led to me eating and drinking alcohol quite a good bit. I definitely was eating everything in sight without any hesitation.

I got back yesterday and weighed myself and I gained about 10 lbs 😕.

Did I actually gain that much weight? Did everything I worked hard for get wiped away? I’m no expert by no means but I’d like to get an idea what happened to me and is it going to be hard to drop this extra weight I supposedly put on? Thanks!"
keto,Non coffee or diet coke caffeine drinks?,"I'm looking for something a little bit more niche. Never really liked coffee, and I was/am a huge diet coke fiend. I stopped that by drinking caffeinated crystal light, which is objectively cheaper and likely healthier than diet coke. Hell, I even invested in a Drinkmate (like a sodastream) for carbonated crystal light! Delicious.

But I realized...these caffeine packets have about 2-3g in them, and I drink about 5 of them a day (sometimes more). Thats 10-20g of carbs. I just started my Keto journey so I'm glad I figured this out sooner than later.

Is there a creative solution that's cost-friendly and maybe even cheaper? If I can make a caffeinated ketoade (or buy it, even)....that's a win. as long as it's not stupidly expensive."
keto,Retaining water from high sodium meals.,"Before y’all ask, this is my third round with keto. I do it after every baby to lose the weight and I was always successful and felt great. My macros are correct. I am only a week in this time, but I’ve noticed when I eat a lot of sodium I’ll pack on 2-3 lbs the next morning. Example is last night I made Swedish meatballs and used a ton of better than bouillon in the gravy. I am super puffed up today. 

I never had the initial woods at 3 days either. Is my body just taking longer to kick in this time? 

Relevant facts: I have about 35 lbs to lose. I am weaning from breastfeeding. I’m on antidepressants and I wasn’t the first two times I did keto. 

Thanks!"
keto,Ldl Cholesterol advice?,"Just had a phone checkup after in depth bloodwork. Been on strict keto since 2019 when I found out I'd eaten my way into diabetes. So far so fantastic!

A1C is holding solid at 5.2
LDL Cholesterol is creeping up on me at 2.8, and the doctor said they'd like to see it under 2.0

Any advice on dropping cholesterol levels while still eating mostly proteins and fats? Or is the doc incorrect on cholesterol goals while on keto?"
keto,Analytics - Comparison from my two Keto periods,"Hi!

I had a very successful first 'attempt' at a Keto diet last Summer which I thoroughly enjoyed - losing almost 9.5 KG and 3.5% body fat in 3/4 months. Whilst the diet was sustainable, I felt great, healthy, energetic etc. I did quit for 3-4 months and following the birth of my daughter and an over-indulgent Christmas break I had put pretty much all of it back on, which I thought was fair enough.

I've tried again this year, with some success - 6.5KG and 3.2% body fat loss in the same period, but finding it harder work and less rewarding this time around - I think as the gains are slower than the previous period?

I'm copying below the 'data points' from both periods and I'd really greatly appreciate your feedback to help me get answers to my two main questions:

1. I've used so many different calculators it's difficult to know what kind of weight and body fat % loss I should be targeting (per week) and if my Macros are (or were) optimised. I got the feeling with attempt #1 I was potentially losing weight a little 'too quickly', but that also gave me the flexibility to have cheat days knowing it would not derail me for too long.
2. Should I be taking the logical approach and reverting to my previous Macros where I was getting results I was happy with? I am currently 85KG which is by no means heavy, but my body-fat is around 25% fat which I am desperate to reduce. I do very little exercise currently, due to a combination of COVID and new family life - if that makes any difference.

**Attempt #1 (Averages)**

FAT - 120G / 65%  
PROTEIN - 105G / 25%  
CARBS - 17G / 4%  
CAL - 1600  
\- 0.7KG and 0.3% FAT loss per week

**Attempt #2 (Averages)**

FAT - 110G / 55%  
PROTEIN - 135G / 35%  
CARBS - 17G / 4%  
CAL - 1700  
\- 0.3KG and 0.1% FAT loss per week

Thank you so much in advance!"
keto,Acne when not on keto,"Hi all wise people out there! 

I have a curious question. I’ve been on keto for about 1,5 years and it generally works great for me! However, this is a question on stepping off keto, which I’ve done about three times during those 1,5 years, for various reasons. However, every single time, I’ve gotten horrible acne after a week or so back on carbs. We’re talking teenage-level BAD acne. 

Would anyone happen to know why? 
I’ve never had bad problems with acne before starting keto, not even in my teens, and it doesn’t seem to matter if I’m eating crappy stuff or healthy (non-keto) food. Anyone?"

keto,Higher Quality Meat Sources,"Hello everyone,

Where can I get higher quality meat and eggs? I mean like pasture raised, grass finished, without having to try too hard or spend a fortune. What about shellfish from less contaminated areas?

keto,Not losing weight,"I lost 80 lbs two years ago on Keto and the partially fell off the wagon since. It helps my migraines so I never stay off for long but want consistent enough to keep the weight off. I gained back about 40lbs. After Christmas I started back in full time and lost 8 lbs right away. Since then, I haven’t been really losing. I cheated a month ago but have been really good the past month and have lost maybe 1 lb. 

It was so easy the first time and I’m getting frustrated. I have trouble tracking calories long term because it tends to trigger my binge eating but when I do track I’m staying within calories and carb limits. 

I’m not really looking for advice since I’ve been around long enough to see the majority of it. However, I was wondering if anyone else had similar issues when they started again?  I feel better on it and it helps me avoid binging, but I’m getting frustrated by not seeing the scale change."

keto,What are some sweet Keto snacks with the “right” kind of sugar substitutes?,"Hey all! I just stared keto last week and I’ve been going around the super market trying to find some easy to grab items that are keto friendly for my sweet tooth! I found lots of things that taste great, but I just came to realize that they all have Sucralose...

I recently started to read about the different sugar substitutes and their effects and from what I understand you want to look for Erythritol and Stevia? I went ahead and read the ingredient lists on most of the items, I found that everything I buy has Sucralose in it. After reading about all the different sugar subs I have to be honest I’m kind of turned off from Sucralose and I’m starting to lose hope that there is anything decent out there to snack on. 

So, I was wondering if there are any items out there that you guys may have come across that have different and more “appropriate” sweetener ingredients that you enjoy?

One big thing I couldn’t find was a coffee mate substitute for my hot coffee in the mornings! The one I bought has Sucralose too!"

keto,Is this normal?,"I started Keto March 16 (a couple weeks ago). I was around 193 then. I’ve started Keto twice before but gave up, both times I dropped 10 pounds in the first week. This time I was keeping up with my water WAY better however. This time I only dropped 4.4 pounds in the first week. Yesterday I woke up to discover I weighed a pound more than I did the morning before. I still weigh exactly that this morning. 185.8. So in these weeks I’ve essentially only dropped 2 pounds at most, since I will regain at least 5 pounds of water weight as soon as I go back to eating carbs. This diet is not going to be a lifetime change for me. I was just trying to drop some quick pounds before trying for another baby with the hubby.

I’ve been logging my daily food intake and have stayed well within my carb goals of less than 18g a day. Often I’m ending the day with 8 or more carbs remaining. I’ve also not gone over my other macros either. And have stayed within range of all of them. I’m definitely not eating too much and I don’t snack much as I hate virtually all sugar alternative snacks. My ketones tests all come back positive everyday.

Is this normal weight loss? Or should I just give up? Maybe Keto just cannot work for me. This is a very hard diet to stick to. I’ve no problems giving up snacks, as I’d already limited myself before I started keto, but no pasta or rice or bread is very hard. Still I could easily stick with it if it were actually doing any good but at this point I feel it’s not doing much of anything at all. Two pounds (maybe) in the first week is not worth it. I could eat healthier and force myself to actually excessive for that measly amount. Any thoughts, advice, especially from those keto veterans out there, would be great! Thanks!"
keto,"Aldi keto bread still out of stock, is it discontinued?","I'm in the NoVa area and every single aldi I've been to for the past month has been completely sold out.

I saw someone said something about mislabeled or moldy product on this sub, but that's pretty obscure. Anyone have any real insight?

I'm actually not even doing keto anymore but I'm still gravitating towards low carb/high protein/fat because eating straight carbs/bread just makes me hungry right away. I used this stuff to make french toast with really good macros daily and my breakfasts just haven't been the same since :( I honestly can't even enjoy regular french toast because I'm starving within a couple hours if I make it with normal bread."

Now, I’ve switched to Coffee Mate sugar free creamer, and HWC to sweeten the coffee and I’ve also been eating Mission Carb Balance tortillas. Are these two things going to get in the way of any weight loss or is it okay since I’m staying under 20-30 carbs per day?? Any advice would be helpful. Thanks!"

keto,6 weeks in and can't hit Ketosis.,"Male, 36, 93kg.
I was hoping to get some help about why I can't get my body to enter Ketosis.. .

For the last 4-5 weeks I've been attempting Keto, but can't get my weight to move (even a single KG). 

Biggest problem I've got, is I can't accurately macro track my meals, because I work remotely and eat at a cafateria (buffet) for all my meals. 

I've been using myfitnesspal to track my macros as best I can, this weeks macros (65% fat, 28% prot, 8% carbs) should be working for me. 

I ordered a few little additions to help, like ketofatbomb coffee creamer and keto cheesecake smoothies to help boost the fat, because I just can't get easy access to avacodos and coconut oil.

Look forward to ideas and thoughts on what's causing this, or what worked for you to kick start keto. 

Attached is the last 7 days of macros/calories.

keto,Can I add Fibre to any dish to lower net carbs?,"I was thinking today about some store bought items that don't have a great net carb count. I wondered if I added a high fiber item to that would it lower the overall net carbs.

For example, a serving if my favourite salsa is fairly high at 4-5 net carbs per serving.  Could I add 2 Tbsp of ground flax to that?  That much flax has 0 net carbs and 4 fiber.  So by doing this have I actually brought the serving of salsa down to 1 net carb?

keto,Just hit the 70s.,"At 158cm (5'2) 106.9 kg (236lbs), 6.5 months ago the 70s seemed so far away. I weighed myself this morning and I'm at 79.8kg (176lbs). I've officially lost 27.1 kgs (60 lbs). I cannot believe it!

I've started Keto September 13th 2020 and never stopped. I haven't had a cheat day, but more of a treat day - with Keto treats of course. 

I only started getting serious about exercising at the end of Jan 2021 because I wanted to tone up more. It actually slowed down my weightloss due to the building of muscle. But I coupled it with IF 16:8 which I worked well with my lifestyle. 

Anyway, I think I have realistic timelines. I hope to be at 68kg (150 lbs) by end of July 2021. But if it doesn't happen, it's fine. I just want to keep going. 😊"
keto,Nearing the end of Month 2!,"SW: 223 CW: 203 GW: 180 H: 5’3 F18

When first start I was totally lost. I didn’t know what most of the letters and numbers above meant. After a while it became apparent. I made an account specifically for this subreddit. I had stalked it for about a month before giving it a try. The current goal weight is only my first goal. I will be setting new goals after reaching those. Making realistic goals for myself first. 

The first month I lost 16 pounds. I started at the beginning of February. I was absolutely shocked by how much better I felt within that first month. No more bloating, more mental clarity, overall I became less socially anxious and never as tired as I used to be! Not to mention the reduced appetite and overall confidence boost that it gave me determination. No more of my reckless binge eating. 

During March I hit a miniature stall. I lost another pound or so in the beginning of March. The scale wasn’t budging at all after that. It went on for about 3 weeks. Not enough to be called an official stall. It wasn’t until this last week that the scale started to budge again. Even though it only budged a pound it felt like a huge victory after it refusing not to budge for almost an entire month. I know, I know, the inches matter too. Although I don’t really have anything to measure inches. But during March I also noticed my endurance had increase as some of you might have seen from my recent NVS evil hill post. Even though I have only lost 4 pounds this month even the small victories add up. Who knows there is still 2 more days to go in March. But I am 4 pounds away from onederland! Been almost 2 years since I had last been in onederland.

If anyone needs a push to start or get back on well here it is. Small victories count and they sure do add up over time. Also on a little side note, has anyone else like when they look at high carb foods they used to love, they just don’t look as appetizing anymore? KCKO."
keto,April 1st will be 3 months on Keto - and I’ve only lost 22lbs.,"I’m 27 and my starting weight was 343lbs. I’m only 5’5 so I figured I would lose a lot the first little bit. I have my macros set to the ketogenic percentage. My calorie deficit calculations are good and I weight and track my food. I started incorporating walking 1km to work and back everyday - I drink my water like I should....and I really limit the keto fake food and treats. The only thing I haven’t tried is IF and I’ve stayed away from it because I have a history of eating disorders. I lost 12lbs in January, and now Feb and March have been roughly about 5lbs a month each. My partner has last 43lbs and I know people who started much later after me and have lost more. I feel like slowly I’m getting discouraged and second guessing if I can do this. Most days I’m ok - but more frequently I’m second guessing myself and feeling pretty down. I don’t understand why the scale is not moving as quickly. Are some people just slow losers or still have a hard time even with keto?"

keto,Depressed and feeling hopeless,"5'0"". 176lbs. I have been trying to lose weight for 2 decades and have never been successful despite my efforts, I have always exercised moderately. I have never been an over eater, dont even like fast food or junk but will over snack here and there but its never been a real problem as I never keep snacks in the house. I have always felt that I eat less than most people yet have always been heavier than most. Every attempt to lose weight has resulted in a measly 5lbs loss in 3 months or so then I lose heart and give up because the process is always painful for me, so then just go back to my old way of eating, even though my old way of eating ain't bad at all.

Anyway I started my keto journey mid Feb, weighed myself after 3 weeks of carefully logging my food intake with 20 grams of carbs. Miserable most if the time and wondering if I am just wasting my time like before and . Then I stepped on the scale and had barely lost anything, maybe 1lb, despite all the science saying its in those first few weeks that you lose rapidly, never seems to happen for me on any diet. I cried to realize I hadn't lost anything despite eating keto for 3 weeks. And I am eating the right way I know, I eat enough fat and protein to not be hungry but I miss regular good so much. 

So I will not weigh myself for a couple more months. I dont feel or look like I have lost any weight and its been 1.5 months, even fasted two whole days. Cheat days = 3.

But I feel so hopeless
1. Anyone out there who felt like their initial weight loss didn't even really happen like it does for everyone else?
2. How do you stay the course when you feel so discouraged,  when you think despite your efforts nothing will ever work for you and you see no light at the end of the tunnel.
3. I have heard a lot of people say there have been on keto for years. Wondering at what point you were fully happy with the keto lifestyle, no longer miserable with what you had to eat and did not even miss carbs anymore? When will I get to this point too?

I feel so hopeless, and kind of miserable because I miss the carbs. Everyday is a struggle even though I have kept at it for 1.5 months. I need some encouragement as I am about to throw in the towel."

I'm on about 1000 calories a day and very low carbohydrates and animal fats, lots of veggies and 4-6 oz protein a day plus supplements and food from the plan (most are 100-200 cals).

I was fine through the first 2.5 weeks but then I started to get nausea's when I would eat or think of food. Now I don't want to eat at all (not hungry and just don't think about eating which is very weird for me) and when I do need to eat (per the diet routine) I almost want to throw up thinking about it. Even foods I used to love make me feel like throwing up, it's like I'm pregnant or my hormones changed and now everything makes me feel sick.

It's this normal? My weight loss coach doesn't know what's going on and had never seen this before"
keto,"50 yr old male-4 weeks in and the ""arthritis"" in my neck that could only be controlled with regular CBD oil for the last 3 years has disappeared, my blood sugar is stable, I am sleeping better and getting up less during the night for a pee, no more tired periods and 16lbs lighter.","There are so many benefits in such a short space of time. My wife is also doing keto and has seen a dramatic reduction in her post-menopausal symptoms, mainly the number and severity of hot flushes. This was unexpected but very welcome for her as she is now sleeping better and has more energy during the day. She also had a very slow bowel but that has also normalized. I was hypertensive but now my blood pressure is in the normal range and I've lost 6 inches around my waste which I presume was visceral fat. We are following the fast 800 with a view to maintaining a keto diet for the foreseeable future with a few modifications such as more quality animal fats."

We’re getting into hiking shape and I’m noticing my hips and knees are aching more. Could be my crap shoes (or that I’m officially entering my mid thirties??) but I’m wondering if a collagen supplement would help support the miles we’re putting in.

As always, thanks!"

keto,Could it be protesis instead of ketosis? Lol,So I started keto and OMAD a couple of days ago. I'm not counting ketons and macros and whatever. I just cut off all my high carb food and just eat lots of beef(I mean A LOT!) Plus eggs and fat(mostly lamb fat and butter). I ALSO TAKE 6 BCAA pills a day (3 before and 3 after workout) I feel like I might be taking too much protein than I should and I'm like what if my body starts burning proteins instead of fats because of that lol.

keto,Not losing now but i used to melt away when I tried keto last year!,"Hello and thanks to anyone who responds in advance. 

I have been on keto for 6 weeks and have lost 4 pounds. I've been strict and have only cheated once with half a piece of cake at my own engagement dinner.  I'm frustrated because I tried keto a few times last year and the weight would melt off me. I lost 13 pounds then 17 pounds, but gained the weight back once I abandoned the lifestyle. I thought the next time I'd try keto, I'd have no problem losing the weight but this year has been so different! I've been the strictest I've ever been on keto and i have barely lost anything. 

\-Most days, I do about an hour to an hour 15 min of cardio on an empty stomach. It's not super strenuous, but I've mixed up doing walking and HIIT some days, and just walking and elliptical on others. I don't believe i'm over exercising. 

\-I ordered a Keto Mojo about 3 weeks ago and my fasting glucose is in the 70-80 range. My ketone level is consistently under 1. One or two days it went up to 1.5 but I mostly stay at 0.5 to 0.8. 

\-I did one meal a day for about 2 weeks, making sure my one meal was rich in good fats. I'd drink coffee, eat 3 farm fresh eggs, keto toast with 4 net grams carbs, and i would make an avocado spread. And of course, MCT oil. I reduced my cheese intake and nut intake. I do not eat keto snacks. 

\-Since I haven't been losing, I've looked into whether a few of the foods (like for example, the keto bread) are causing my blood sugar to rise. I've tested this using my KetoMojo to test my BG and ketones 30 min, 1 hour, and 3 hours after I eat. No problem with the foods! None of the ones I suspected increased my blood sugar more than 25 units at 30 min, and I returned to baseline by 3 hours. 

\-Yes, I get good sleep.

\-No, I don't think i'm that stressed out at all. 

Any help would be very much appreciated. Why am I not losing like before? Should I do fasting? One meal a day? I do that then read that the reason I'm not losing is because my calorie count is too low! I'm so discouraged and sad."

keto,sucess," 

Depois de dar à luz nosso filho em julho passado, eu sabia que precisava perder peso. Mas eu estava com medo. Eu havia tentado e falhado tantas vezes que simplesmente não conseguia passar pela ansiedade, impaciência, autocrítica, desespero e derrota mais uma vez. Portanto, decidi esperar até que estivesse emocionalmente pronto para perder peso. (Graças a esta submissão, eu já estava mentalmente preparado e sabia o que precisava fazer quando estivesse pronto para me comprometer.)

Para mim, prontidão emocional significava aprender a ser grato pelo meu corpo. Tinha carregado dois bebês lindos (um que pesava 4,5 kg ao nascer) e era forte apesar de anos de estresse e alimentação estressante. Também tive que parar de ver minha dieta como um castigo por engordar e, em vez disso, começar a ver a perda de peso como um presente que eu queria dar ao meu corpo por tudo que ele fez por mim. E, finalmente, eu tive que deixar de acreditar que eu tinha que fazer Keto perfeitamente, e se eu não o fizesse, eu estava condenado ao fracasso e acabaria desistindo. De novo.

Quando reiniciei o Keto em 9 de fevereiro, me pesei, mas não tirei nenhuma foto. Eu não rastreei minhas macros ou registrei minha comida porque rastrear essas coisas sempre me fez questionar se eu estava “otimizando” meus esforços. Eu simplesmente comia alimentos com pouco ou nenhum carboidrato (principalmente carne, queijo, ovos, manteiga) e vegetais. Tirei uma foto “antes” alguns dias depois, mas apenas de frente e de trás. E então, algumas semanas depois disso, tirei algumas fotos depois de ver alguém neste grupo dizer como isso foi útil para ela.

keto,Moving my goal weight,"Started keto 8 weeks ago. I’ve lost 20lbs. My original goal weight was 200. Starting weight was 226. Now that I’ve lost 20lbs, I feel like my goal weight should be 190.

I don’t think I’m becoming more ambitious. I think I was delusional to think I only needed to drop 25lbs. I was more overweight than I realized! Has anyone else had a similar experience?"
keto,Got my blood test results,"So a little history. I started on keto about 3 months ago. I also eat all my food within a 4 hour window every day. I weighed about 195 lbs in January and now I'm 173 lbs. Year to date, I've lost about 60 lbs. But the results of my lipids concern me a bit:

Total Cholesterol: 269
HDL: 45
LDL: 203
VLDL: 21
Triglycerides: 116

Compared to a year ago when I was eating a pretty shit diet:
Total Cholesterol: 207
HDL: 39
LDL: 148
Triglycerides: 96

I'm thinking it is possibly due to all the weight loss and my weight has honestly just started to stabilize. I feel great on this diet so I'm wondering if anyone here had similar results."

keto,Newie question,"Hello, Reddit world! I'm fairly new to this sub and I have a couple of questions that you all lovely people might be able to help with. 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I started our keto journey in February. Since then I've lost a total of 14 lbs (Started at 289 lbs sitting at 275 lbs) which is an ACHIEVEMENT all in itself since I'm on a corticosteroid called prednisone for my asthma. Before keto, the hubs and I used to enjoy making yogurt in our instant pot because it was cheaper for us to make our morning breakfasts than buy premade. Since we've started we've been having a hard time finding a good yogurt that is 1. tasty and 2. still keto-friendly. We found some Kroger carb master ones that are pretty good and seem to fall within the carb intake we want but I want to attempt making it ourselves again but I'm at a loss at how to make yogurt at home that's still ok! Does anyone have any experience with this? 

&amp;#x200B;

Second question: Every year we get a ham for Easter and usually after stuffing our faces with delicious delicious ham, we save the ham hock so my hubby can make his fantastic ham hock soup. However this year since we're on the keto train, we're not sure how to make a tasty ham hock soup with no beans in it (his recipe calls for navy beans). Anyone have any good recipes they're willing to share with some newbies? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for all the help! till next time"
keto,How long do you stay on Keto?,I've heard 3-6 months at the most.  I've been on it for about 2 months and have lost about 5 pounds.  I've had 2 all-out cheat days that were birthday celebrations for people so I'm sure that temporarily derailed my progress but wondering what others feel about how long to continue on Keto.
keto,Is long term Keto Bad?,"I was on Keto two weeks and it seemed fine. Just ate chicken and veggies the entire time. For veggies: broccoli and kale. Also a multi vitamin so I don’t up vitamin deficient.

But my friend said it’s a good idea to have a carb cheat day after a few weeks. This way your body doesn’t go in sugar shock if you ever end up eating a candy bar a few months after. And I looked online and it says long term Keto can even cause insulin resistance/diabetes.

So I decided instead to do continuous 2 week keto  with a carb day between. So chicken and veggies every 2 weeks. With carb day of beans, potatoes, carrots, and apples in between. 

Would that work to prevent diabetes on keto?"
keto,Keeping it simple - Huge libido increase / no PMS,"(Long post!)

So a few weeks back I posted here, I was getting anxious about cholesterol and a family history of heart disease. I just kept going, mostly because it just made sense for my body (never - ever have I felt this happy before while doing a major change on my diet, and I followed most of the advice people gave me here). I am a 37 (F), mother of 2, and I still have some weight to lose. These last few weeks I switched yoga for belly dance, 3-4 days a week, kept eating fat, proteins, some vegetables (a bit of zucchini here and there, and cauliflower) and green leaves (spinach, lettuce, etc). 

So everything's going great, but I wanted to ask some of the women here, I've read many posts about Keto worsening your PMS, but my experience was the absolute opposite. I've been eating Keto for almost a month now, and I've always suffered before my period, really bad PMS, horrible migraines, a cyst in my right ovary that sometimes caused excruciating pain (having to go to the ER on some occasions), cramps, loose stools, vomiting, joint pain and binge eating. This month was nothing like that, smooth as silk. I didn't have any cravings (though I ate cocoa nibs before and dark chocolate with no sugar), I did indulge in hot cocoa with a bit of cream and some drops of stevia (don't really use sweeteners at all, but this time I did), and on my first day I'm feeling surprisingly better than I have felt in years. A side effect though, is that a week after I started eating Keto my libido went up, high as hell, like a teenager. I've been looking for an explanation but I still can't quite get it. Is it the estrogens because of the meat I'm eating? Have I always been healthier and hornier and I just got stuck on an awful lifestyle for most of my life? 

It feels crazy, I'm not even counting calories, I just stay Keto as naturally as I can, keeping it very simple, and I know I've lost weight (my balance is broken so idk how much I've lost), but I don't think just losing weight can make me this horny, or feeling so good about myself. Or work on my cyst and my ovaries, and PMS... It feels so amazing. 6 months ago my then boyfriend told me he didn't love me anymore, I don't even know what I was thinking being with him, it was the worse relationship of my life, and as I look back now I feel so different from that overweight, overtired and turned off woman that I was then... 

I'm just so amazed by this return to health, so to speak... I've been approached by other men, I feel is something that it is also starting to show in the outside, so it's not just a feeling apparently. I had sex with a guy I used to date, but my libido still can't get enough (what's wrong with me? 🤣). I can't say that I'm feeling like running a marathon now that I'm on my period, it still hurts a bit, and I still use a warm bottle, but I'm not crying in pain or feeling indisposed. Still feel horny though, that makes me really curious. 

So, have any of you girls / women have noticed this kind of hormonal changes? 

TLDR: Almost a month of Keto, PMS went away, libido is high as hell. Want to know if someone has gone through a similar situation"
keto,Is it possible for ketosis to happen in a few days?,"I decided to give it a try for multiple reasons. 25, I have exercised almost every day for the past year, diet was already quite good but still felt like a slug with the carbs and with some brain fog &amp; anxiety.

keto,Dizziness - don’t think electrolytes are the problem,"I’m on day 5 of keto. I started having dizziness yesterday that lasted 4 hours, not intense but made me have to hold onto stuff occasionally. I drank a lot of water and felt better. Dizziness is back this morning and now it’s afternoon. Water isn’t helping, sodium isn’t helping.

Me:

Female

Height: 5’9”

Weight: 171

Age: 31

Protein: 76g

Fat: 102g

Carbs: 20g (I’ve been eating well under 20g, not sure if that’s a problem?)

Daily Calories: 1,200 (trying to lose weight. I’ve been struggling to hit this target the last couple days as I’m nauseous as well)

Electrolytes: 

1 magnesium 400mg supplement per day,

1 avocado per day (100g) for potassium,

2 teaspoons salt per day in beef stock.

Water: 2 litres per day.

Dizziness began yesterday (day 4) and I realised I was way behind on my water. I felt better after drinking a lot of water.

Today I’ve been diligent in getting over 1 litre in before midday, but I feel lousy. Dizzy and nauseous. I managed breakfast but I feel sick.

Are my macros all out of whack? Am I not getting enough sodium? Calories too low? I worry the calories may be the issue, I just haven’t wanted to eat much since starting this. 

Any advice much appreciated."

Does anyone have any tips on how to maintain it as a lifestyle realistically? We both love going out for dinner now and again and having a nice drink and we don’t want to have to give carbs up completely and forever. Has anyone successfully kept to “Keto at home” or “Keto during the week”? Is it even possible? Any tips or motivation would be great especially when you have small children and we have carbs in the house!"
keto,Is stevia really that bad?,"I have PCOS, I have been using stevia for months now, it has helped me greatly with my sugar cravings. 
but I have read the other day that stevia is an endocrine disruptor:""As a type of steroid, steviol glycosides can interfere with hormones, While stevia boosts the production of the hormone progesterone, it also blocks progesterone receptors.""
This disappointed me greatly, as I can't afford other sweeteners like erythritol and monk fruit, they're rare and expensive where I live."
keto,Does Keto stop snoring?,"So I’ve been on Keto for about a month down 15 pounds. I have sleep apnea and am a chronic horrible snorer. I went on a trip with my sister recently and shared a hotel room, she noted that I didn’t snore at all. Which seems crazy because I usually snore really bad where people can’t even sleep though. I would say it could be weight loss but I’ve been snoring since I was a kid and weighed much much less.

I don’t wanna go back to eating junk food/sweets all the time or starchy foods like bread/potatoes all the time. Like maybe here N there. I rather enjoy it &amp; reward my self!

keto,What is your telltale sign that you’re in ketosis?,"When I first started LCHF my wife pointed out when I was in ketosis due to the keto breath, but now that I am fat adapted that has disappeared. Short of testing my blood ketones it is difficult to be certain, but I get a slight tingling in my lips when I’m fat burning. I mentioned this to a colleague - they don’t get the same tingling, but have a slight metallic taste in their mouth. It got me wondering, is this person specific, and if so what are the different telltale signs that we each experience that tells us that we are in ketosis?"
keto,Relatively new but positive [30M,"Hey ppl :D

I hope you are all doing great in these crazy times. 

I’m relatively new to the keto experience. I started on the 15th March and have been relatively consistent in maintaining 2000 cals, 150p 170f &lt;20n.c. across 4 meals a day.

So far I have lost 4.6kg (10lbs). I have had a few off-days where a pizza and cookie dough attacked me and I had to eat them. But 6/7 I’m keto and really enjoying it. Any tips to beat the darn sweet tooth?

I’m trying the 90% dark chocolate but it just makes me want to go smash a family of 8 size baked cookie dough or whole Colin the Caterpillar birthday cake. No Jokes 😭😭😭

I know this question is asked a fair amount. But is 10lbs a lot to loose in 3 weeks? Mainly because I’m not trying to massively undercut my cals because I want to loose it slowly with training and toning (usually burn 300-400 cals W/ exercise, 4 days a week). Plus I’m 89kg at 6ft and pretty broad anyway. 

Lastly... on the topic of protein, I have been aiming for 140g of protein but I do tend to overshoot that as I love the meat. Will an extra  40-50g throughout the day push me out of ketosis? Will I know I’ve been pushed out of ketosis without testing for it?"
keto,Has anyone dealt with Keto Rash?,"Couple of years ago I was able to get to my ideal weight through ketogenic diet.

keto,Struggling with losing weight,"Hi all - I started Keto on 22 Feb and I am struggling a little to lose some weight. I've lost 2kg only in that month and thats been a bit disheartening. I have had one cheat day in that time and I realise that was a mistake but I have been rock solid since.

I am doing keto with IF of 18-6 and have thrown in a 36 hour fast twice in that month. The weird thing is that when I weighed myself on 14 March, I was on 105.8 (I started at 111kg) and was delighted. However this was shortlived, as when I jumped on the scale 5 days later, I was up at 110.

Macros as follows: Max carbs 30g, P: consistently above 133g goal and Fat:  goal was 121g but consistently below. I work out a few days a week (mainly walks and some cardio at home).

Calorie intake was supposed to be at 1650 however my worst day was at 1992.

I love Keto.  But doing it well took a chunk of time that simply is not available to me at this point.  As stated in my title, I work 55-60 hours per week and have returned to school to finish my degree.  I take 2 classes in the Spring, Summer and Fall terms and 1 class in the winter term (it is only 4 weeks long - talk about intense!!!!).

I have a great arrangement with my boss where I am allowed to use company resourses for studying.  I work six days a week.  I do my work and when I punch out, I can just pick right up with doing homework and any online stuff that needs to occur.  On work days, I get there around 8 a.m., work, punch out, study and then go home.  The drawback...getting home is usually about 10 p.m.  Sundays, while a day off, I usually go into the office again and spend about 10-12 hours studying and doing homework. 

Time is at a premium for me.  I used to do meal preps in the evenings and on Sundays (I make an awesome homemade beef jerky - do I ever miss that...), but right now that just does not occur consistantly.  I am hoping to receive ideas and suggestions about meals that people have found that can be made quickly.  Or ideas you have seen that work in busy scenarios.  

I am sure someone will suggest doing my studying at home to accomplish both.  I tried that my first semester.  Home offers too many distractions and ways to NOT spend the time I need to studying.  I should also note that I was diagnosed with ADHD about half way through my first semester after I started school again.  Even with medication, those distractions available at home grab my attention way too easily. 

The arrangement with my boss to study and do homework at work has been a god send for being able to focus on school.  Work is literally for WORK.  Paid WORK and then home-WORK. It just does not lend itself to spending any significant time on doing Keto as well as I used to.  

I would love to hear success others have had in busy situations.  Quick recipes appreciated!!!

Thank you.  KCKO!!!"

keto,Opioids + Keto,"Do opioids hinder Keto? At 350lbs I started losing weight after the holidays and got down to 330ish and then I started keto almost a month ago and lost almost 30lbs in the first three weeks. The past week I've plateaued at 300-305. Due to my recent loss of weight I've been more active which has flared up some old sports injuries. So I started taking half of a 50mg tramadol (prescribed by my physician for this condition) during the day just to take the edge off. Google didn't seem to pull up much data, perhaps I was searching incorrectly. Being as I am more active and still staying in ketosis I'm curious if there is a link?"

keto,Planning to intermittently fast before breaking keto for upcoming wedding.,"Trying to make a game plan to have the best success  for this upcoming  wedding. Should I stay as low carb as I can a few days prior? Will doing IF a few days before ensure my body uses wedding carbs as fuel rather than fat? 

Does anyone have any reading or watching suggestions for a planned break from keto? It's  one day and I want to drink, eat, and have a good time.

In the past I have just jumped off keto and jumped right back on and it's  been fine, but if there is a better way that I can either maintain  or continue to lose for the wedding that would be cool."
keto,"Occasional Unusual Schedule, Here: Does One Eat for the Waking Day or the Calendar Day?","Hi everyone. 43m / 6'2"" / SW276 / CW220 / GW215. Long time listener, first time caller, here.  

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm a semi-nocturnal kind of character (down at 4am, up at 11am), and it's common due to my schedule (and the fact that we all live in a diurnal world) that occasionally, and for a number of reasons, my schedule will ""flip"" or be irregular for several days or I'll fall into a 36-hour schedule. It happens, it's totally a part of both my schedule and my profession. My real question is this:

&amp;#x200B;

So let's just say for whatever reason, I'm awake for 24 hours. When counting calories and macros for keto, do I count my waking time, or the actual time?

&amp;#x200B;

Meaning, is sleep kind of a ""reset"" that restarts when I should start tracking for the next day? Or should I be treating each day as a separate day for tracking calories and macros regardless of whether I've slept or not? Both seem like they'd make sense: being awake longer probably means you need more calories, right?

&amp;#x200B;

For example:

&amp;#x200B;

I eat 2,056 calories a day and I'm awake for 36 hours, then sleep for 12. Should I only be eating my 2,056 calories, or should I be eating two days worth of calories? Or even 1.5x my normal caloric intake?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been trying to find answers for this, and I haven't come up with anything yet. Any input?"
keto,keto diet on a meal plan,"Hey all, I'm 19F and 225ish pounds, give or take. I want to try keto to get back down to 190 where I feel comfortable and confident in my body. Keto seems so difficult without a guide, especially since I don't make my own food. Because of this I don't want to purchase a personalized plan. The cafeterias have a good amount of options but I just don't know what to get.

Does anyone have resources like sites or apps that can help me plan my meals and choose the best items for a keto diet?"
keto,Happy St Pat’s. Now how to track COOKED Guinness?,"Hi all!  
I’m doing the traditional Corned Beef and Cabbage for my mom tonight, but we ALWAYS add Guinness.  Without it, it’s not the same.

How would you track that?  Just build the recipe and include it for the carbs?  I’m not sitting here drinking one, and most will be left behind in the pot.

Thoughts?"
keto,Keto and smoking,"I just started keto 2 weeks ago and for some reason i dont feel the need of smoking anymore. Before I smoked almost everyday, constantly was in the mood for a cigar and now suddenly nothing. The other day I started one, a small one, just out of habit, and halfway through i just threw it away.

Ditch Keto and go low carb?"
keto,Question on how much fat I should be eating.,"I played with full carnivore for 3 months and it was a lot of fun but sadly I didn't follow through. Now I am doing some research again and trying keto. This time round i am going to be a little more scientific:

If I eat 1,200 grams of whole chicken, the yields are:

**Protein** 326g

**Total Fat** 162g

**Calories** 2858  
 

**Here are my macros:**

Gender: Male | Age: 48 | Weight: 75 kg | Height: 183 cm

Calorie Goal: 10% Surplus 

Protein: 104g  

Carbs: 23g  

Fat: 211g  

Target: 2404 kcal

&amp;#x200B;

So I would need to supplement more fat into my diet because I am deficit by 49 grams (211-162)?

Then I just swallow some butter or olive oil or whatever healthy fats, correct? 

1 tablespoon = 12.7817005 grams.

Hence, 49/12.8 = approximately 4 tablespoons.

Correct?

Also another question, since the entire chicken yields 326g of protein and my macro allows me daily of 104g, is there any/too much negatives from eating too much protein?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"
keto,Struggling and in need of encouragement,"Hi all, I’m almost two months in to keto and I’ve lost almost 30 lbs. I’ve been stuck at 29 lbs for about two weeks with no progress and I’m starting to get really discouraged. I tried “resetting” to no avail, and I’m trying to limit my calories to 1000 or very very low because I’m desperate to see any movement, but it’s really affecting my mood. I also have been trying to make sure I hit my water goal. I guess if anyone has any tips on how to get thru this but it would be very appreciated: but even just a “hang in there” would be very helpful. I still have about 120 lbs to go before I reach my goal so quitting is not an option, but I’m having fantasies about just giving up and I need some kind of forward motion to help me here."
keto,Keto and stiff neck,"I started keto/lcif two months ago, lost some weight but I keep on getting stiff neck. The first time it started on the left side then a day after moved to the right. I went to a chiropractor and an acupuncturist to try to alleviate the pain. It helped but this week it came back again. 
I have no idea what could be causing this as I’ve been sleeping in the same bed with the same pillows. I’ve been taking magnesium at night (400mg) hoping it would help but still no relief.
I don’t want to be popping pain relievers just to be able to move and excercise:( 
Hopefully someone here can help! 🙏🏽"
keto,How do you maintain weight on the keto diet?,"Over the past year and a half I've lost 7 and a half stone, and I'm at a healthy weight now. I started keto to basically kick my addiction to sugary foods and drinks and limit my carbs. I'm not really trying to loose too much weight because people keep saying I'm losing too much too fast. I managed to steady my weight loss by eating more on days when I was most active (I have an active job which burns a lot of calories, I ended up having to snack on foods to try and keep my calories up). 

It's been just over a week and I feel so much better. No chocolate, crisps, burgers, chips, cheesy mash, pizza, ice cream, sugary, energy or alcohilic drinks- the things I eat/drink most. I've been having so much salad and veg and meat, always meal prepping, I even started to cook! Before I would just grab what was there because it was convenient whilst I was hungry. I'm even starting to get hungry less, and just snack on seeds and nuts and these low carb cracker type things with peanut butter or cheesy spread. This, I know, will do me a world of good, health-wise.

My only issue is I don't think I'm meeting my calorie goals for the amount I burn when working, and I work a lot. A lot of it is probably water weight, but I've lost 6.5 pounds in a week. And any more it will take me lower than the threshold I want to stay in. (I have a limit for how heavy I want to be, and a limit on how small I want to be). 

What can I do to stay on keto but bump up my calorie intake? I've got fitness Pal where I add all the foods and then I use the data from my Garmin watch to see roughly how much I've burned and it shows I need to have quite a bit more to maintain or at least not lose too much. Suggestions?"

keto,How long will it take to loose 30lbs in my case?,"I'm completely new to keto but want to give it a try. I'm a female 5""11 and 180 lbs, my goal is 150 lbs so 30 lbs loss is what I'm working towards!

I'm going to use the carb manager app, and also count my calories, incorporating some exercise + 16:8 intermittent fasting. This is the plan, and I'm nervous but ready and determined. 

My question: how long will it take to loose this 30 lbs in my case? What's been your personal experience? 

I eat very well and clean, but it seems this 30 lbs is very stubborn and struggles to budge. I'm going to keep my calories only at a medium deficit aiming for 0.5-1 lb of weight loss per week."
keto,Keto weight loss to date,"I started my keto diet just a day over one month ago. My weight at that time was 262. I’m 6’5” with a muscular build so I didn’t appear too fat at that weight. But none of my summer clothes fit anymore. There’s no running from that. Yesterday morning, I weighed in at 244. I’d like to get to about 225. I must say, it’s been incredibly easy so far. I’m rarely hungry. I eat more at breakfast than I ever did before keto. I’ve cut back a little at dinner, mainly because I’m not eating potatoes any more. I rarely ate lunch before keto and I still don’t.  I miss my Fuji apples and clementines, but it’s a small sacrifice. If you’re thinking about keto, my advice is to go for it."
keto,Possibly insane notion: Fish oil for cooking....?,"So, I have a bit of a crazy question that might be... possibly... a really good idea.

I fail to regularly take suppliments and know that I should eat more fish (I try to eat a tin of sardines once a week), and my partner isnt too keen on eating fish so getting my omega 3 is pretty hard.

I came to a bit of a revelation that maybe I could use fish oil instead of olive oil to cook my meals.

Now fish oil is really damn expensive to buy a 500ml bottle for $30.... but hear me out.... I came across fish oil suppliments for race horses and greyhounds that are quite cheep for 20L tins at $60... 

Is this a crazy idea... or am I onto something here?"
keto,Blood test during keto diet,"First time I tried keto was on February 1st, lasted for two weeks. Quit due to heart palpitations. (I suspect i wasn’t getting enough electrolytes) even though I had 3 cups of spinach daily and lots of meat, lots of salt, lots of vegetables. Started again yesterday, but I want to do it properly this time so i asked my mom if we can get NoSalt, and magnesium citrate to help me. But she’s convinced I don’t need to supplement AT ALL, I disagree, because even when I tried my best to eat the right foods, I was still getting symptoms. I came up with the idea to get a blood test during my keto diet to prove I’m right, but I used a keto stick today (2nd day on keto) and I’m not in ketosis yet. My mom wants me to get the blood test on Friday, Will any electrolyte deficiency show up in 3 days if I stick to the diet? Or should I wait longer. I don’t want to get a blood test, only for it to say I’m fine (which proves my mom right) and then a week later start getting symptoms of electrolyte deficiency
TL;DR 
When should I get a blood test to see if I’m getting the proper nutrients on keto"
keto,"Keto help, I’m desperate","I need to lose 40-60lbs by June 26th. It’s my best friends wedding and it’s already been postponed once and i had another entire year to do so but i cant do these things. The first time keto took a mental toll on me cause everything is so expensive and i was starving myself cause i I’ve always had issues with my face fat so i tried cutting out practically everything. No carbs, sugar, salt, dairy. I’ve always had trouble with loosing weight and nutrition since high school. i would do my research but people would be nosy about what I’m doing and tell me everything I’m doing wrong. Sites always contradicting themselves. To include rice in my meals but white rice is bad, another site says brow rice is bad, another site says rice in general is bad?? What am i suppose to eat? Just a egg alone? When i would choose to get lunch from a restaurant and get something people told me is healthy, i would then get told it’s super unhealthy, like how is a. Big bowl of salad unhealthy?? How do i do it without starving myself cause i really don’t want to have to take that route of just doing what I’m capable of doing and eating one meal a day and working out 2-3 time a day everyday, I’m already in a bad place mentally and i don’t want to have to tell my bestfriend to take me out of her wedding. I couldn’t live with myself if i did that. I’ve missed so many birthday and other events cause of my anxiety, my life is just at its lowest point and i want that to change and i know dropping out of the wedding will be the last straw for me.
I’m unemployed and only willing to spend $30-$40 a week if i have to to buy what i need for keto. Is there a already meal plan that someone can please link me to that’s budget friendly. 
If i can just get a meal plan that’s easy to read, i can do the work outs on my own. I have p90x &amp; insanity that we’re gifted to me. Unfortunately they didn’t come with meal plans or anything. Just the workout videos. regardless of that, the meal plans are expensive."
keto,simple keto icecream,"(life story nonsense to come after recipe)

2 cups heavy cream (12 Grams carbs)

2 scoops of cookies and cream protein powder (6 grams carbs)

erythritol \[ to taste \]

mix the 3 together in a large bowl and whip till stiff peaks. package and freeze. it's creamy, tastes good, and won't throw you out of keto, since the entire container (a whole friggin lot) contains about 18 grams of carbs (you won't eat the entire thing all at once.)

&amp;#x200B;

now for the annoying life story bit.

due to the trouble i had eating (i feel better now), protein shakes have kinda been my savior, my 2 choices were to drink the shake, or hope i get better before i starve.

but after a while, twice daily protein shakes get really boring, and i had to do something to alleviate the boredom. so i did what any sane person would do. i made icecream out of it. now i have some kind of decently sweet (from the protein powder and erythritol) treat to break up the monotony."

keto,In a pickle regarding whether or not to add “desserts”,"I have been contemplating about this for way, way too long and just need to spill it out here. Hopefully some of you can relate.

I have been thriving on clean meats, cheeses, veggies, and coffee every day. I feel amazing, losing weight steadily as well. However, I very much wish I could be someone who can incorporate a sweet “treat” every day/other day or so. I mean like one serving of a Lily’s chocolate bar, for instance. My biggest fear is opening the flood gates and not being able to stop, as pathetic as it sounds. Currently, I have a Lily’s bar all portioned out, sitting in the fridge, yet I’m scared to have a taste. 

Has anyone here had success with incorporating (and controlling) sweets on the keto diet? Or is this just something you no longer choose to eat? I realize everyone is different and I should do what feels right for me. Problem is, I am not sure what is right at this point, and hoping for your advice on what worked for you personally."

keto,"If I eat One Meal Every Other Day (OMEAD) with no carb restriction, will I bounce in and out of Ketosis?","I tried Keto many times for the past 2 years. I have some insulin resistance that I want to reverse, due to my weight.  I cannot make it past week 1 on low carbs, and only end up losing to 20 lbs of water weight in the 1st week. I plan to only eat 1 meal every other day at 9pm of \~1000 calories (with no carb limit, but no sugar/fast food/processed food and lots of protein). I have fasted for a long time and did OMAD since high school, so I can control hunger and ghrelin. But I'm worried that I will bounce in and out of ketosis by fasting (since it takes 48 hrs to be in ketosis) and then eating carbs, thus water weight will continuously fluctuate. I know keto can lower blood sugar significantly but I can't even go past a week on Keto, so I want a sustainable diet that has similar benefits (ie: OMEAD fasting). Will this actually be the case?

keto,30 under 20 Challenge,"I'm fairly new to keto. Well, not really, more like I'm giving it a go again and I'm glad to be here in this subreddit!

I follow the Keto Connect channel on YT. It's run by a keto couple (began as significant others, now husband and wife), who are now have a son and another baby on the way. They just seem like a couple of average folks who've been doing this keto thing for a while and want to share what they've learned. Even their podcast is called Keto for Normies.

I just saw a couple of months ago that they did a ""30 under 20 challenge"", which is essentially eating under 20 net carbs for 30 days. I was immediately intrigued. I know for some of you that's your normal life already but it's new to me, especially as low as 20 so I want to give it a try for 30 days and see what it's like and hopefully use it as a spring board for ketosis and eventually fat adaptation over the next few months.

Just wanted to throw it out there and see if anyone else wants to join in and also to hold myself accountable....starting tomorrow."
keto,Posting this for myself and for others who are losing their motivation,"** on mobile, formatting might suck*** I went to the doctor’s recently and they took my weight and I weighed the same as I did last time I went in before I started keto. I started keto maybe a week or two after the last appointment and I’ve been doing keto for about two weeks. I was PISSED my weight was the same, but the good news is this: I don’t wake up every morning having to shit my brains out anymore. Seriously, I could lay in bed for awhile if I wanted to, but the awful urge to SHIT MY BRAINS OUT got me out of bed every day. My stomach doesn’t feel bloated 24/7 anymore. Legit, period or not, I would feel like I swallowed a basketball. I’m not hungry every 2-3 hours like an infant anymore. That’s pretty sweet. The zits on my neck went away. My double chin looks way less doubly. My back rolls look less rolly. Oh, and the roll of fat under earth my boobs looks smaller. So even though the scale says the same number, I’m gonna keep going."
keto,Green beans with bacon,"I made a sandwich with keto bread for lunch. For a side, I opened up a can of green beans (2g net carbs per serving) and added some bacon crumbles, which I picked up from my Costco run yesterday.

I had to stop myself from eating the whole damn can, which would have been 7g total (3.5 servings) from freaking beans! I think I ended up eating at least 2.5 servings before I stopped.

I read somewhere that the saltiness combined with fat is what causes people to eat potato chips uncontrollably. I think the same applied with these green beans with bacon."

keto,Emergency grocery shop,"Hey friends!

I'm at my parents in the cornbelt for 2 weeks and struggle with a binge eating disorder. However, while in my own home I can control my surroundings with what I buy and bring into my home.

My parents on the other hand are obese couch potatos and have just accepted their fate. The cabinets have the whole snack aisle, and all the convenience of frozen or canned meals and soups. Not a vegetable in sight. Some rotten fruit in a bowl I assume were decoration.

I want to be smart about the 2 weeks and not wasteful. I'm also fighting the urge to binge every moment around here. Just trying to stay out of the kitchen if I'm being honest.

Can y'all do me a favor and drop a quick list you would turn to in a similar situation away from home. Keto only. I can't even think straight and worry I'll walk out of the shops with 8 lbs of celery and a single slab of steak. 

With that said - I also don't really like meat.......... I'm not vegetarian, I just can't stand the smell of meat cooking, nor really do I like the taste unless it's pretty much coated in spices. I love tofu! L

My question is, what are you favorite combinations at fast food places that you modify for keto?

The only place I've eaten out at has been chipotle (Cauliflower rice !) but wondering what else is viable, I can't really think of anything, besides a bunless Quarter Pounder (half joke)"
keto,Struggling to recapture keto benefits for my MS,"Basically the title.

I did keto once a couple of years ago for 4 months and felt absolutely fantastic. Great energy, lucid thinking, really positive emotional state, but life caught up with me and I went back to my normal eating habits.

I've tried to get back into keto three times since then, and I just haven't been able to capture those positive effects again. The last three times I've tried, I remain sluggish and just generally awful feeling for weeks, no matter what I try. I follow the subs electrolyte requirements, I make sure to eat enough fat, I keep my carbs strictly below 20, but I can't seem to recapture the magic of that first keto experience.

Is there something I'm missing? Why would keto just stop working for someone? My MS has been dragging me down lately, and I'd love to return to that energetic keto place.

Preliminary thanks for all your help : )"
keto,A small win,I’ve been on keto for 4 1/2 months now. I’ve lost 37lbs.  I needed to do this for myself but it’s an awesome feeling when people at your job notice your weight loss. When coworkers come up to you and say “you look really good” “have you been loosing weight?” Ect It’s amazing. I don’t plan on stopping keto because there isn’t anything to stop. It’s a lifestyle change. But I just want to thank this community and my friends and some family for helping me with this journey. You Rock!!!
keto,I can’t eat more than 1000 calories daily,"Hi everyone. I started keto about a week ago and I completely lost my appetite.

keto,Has anyone experienced pelvic floor spasms or clenching as a symptom of low electrolytes (or electrolyte imbalance),"When not keto'ing, I get pelvic floor tightening when I first fall in love with someone.  It usually lasts a few months and goes away.

When keto'ing, things are better than fine down there as noted by my naughty bits acting like they're twenty again. 

Well, here I am keto'ing, ""should be"" ok on electrolytes going by how much I ingested before, but still getting the pelvic floor tightening.  I'm also now on Adderall this time around. I'm drinking plenty of water.

I'm kind of looking for people with a similar experience and advice more specific."
keto,"Keto day 9 -- very, very tight muscles? I'm tracking my electrolytes well though. Advice?","I'm keto day 9 and yesterday and today (and a few days before) have been struggling with VERY tight muscles in my legs (hamstrings, calves, thighs), butt, back, neck, arms... basically everywhere.

I'm very stiff like I pulled a muscle everywhere (used to be very flexible, and now can't touch my toes/hurts to stretch etc.)

My electrolytes are: 

5000mg sodium
2000mg potassium (I bumped this up to 3000mg yesterday)
400mg magnesium glycinate

I'm doing this for medical purposes, so my fat ratio is higher then protein. 100+fats, 65-75g protein, 15 carbs. 1500 calories/day (not trying to lose weight.)

I still lost 5lbs water weight anyway though.

I'm 5'2 (120lbs).

I about drink 8-10 glasses of water a day (which I wonder is too much and flushing OUT my electrolytes?)

Upping my potassium seemed to have helped ""a little bit"" compared to yesterday (though not much.) I wonder if I should up my magnesium, too.

Do you think that's my issue? Or is this just an adaptation phase thing?

Thanks, everyone."
keto,Need help counting calories!,"Hey there! I have been trying to lose weight but I can't sleep due to  hunger.

keto,"Today's NSV: About 80% of the clothes in my ""Clothes that don't fit me"" drawer, now fit me!","Today, I was slightly bummed because I gained a bit of weight from yesterday. But it's fine I told myself. Then I suddenly thought of all the clothes in that drawer because I haven't tried them on in 2 months. 

I'm happy to report (as the caption says) that most of them fit me now. Lots of them still with tags (ordered online, couldn't return) from 5 years ago! 

Then this made me think how much I weighed back then. Because the only time I knew is when I went to the doctor's office. (I never weighed myself on my own because I hated seeing it.) So I dug up my old medical records. 

So this part is an SV because now, because from those medical records i found out that I'm actually 2kgs lighter than my 2013 self - friggin 8 years ago! And only 5kgs away from my 2012 self. I was so proud!

That news along with my success controlling my weight and diabetes with keto inspired him to try.  He had his first checkup since starting the diet yesterday and down 17lbs and A1C down from 8.2 to 7.3.  Instead of insulin they’re talking about cutting back his meds if he keeps it up.

keto,"Keto for 3-4 years. Blood Test results. High LDL, Wish HDL was higher &amp; Trigs were lower","Hi guys!

I have been on keto for around 3-4 years and haven't had a blood test in around 4 years. I am 24 years old, lightly active, and have been eating a standard keto diet (meat, greens, dairy, some fruit, some keto sweetners, some nuts, etc.) up until Feb, 1st, where I tried a more keto-carnivoreish style diet (more red meat, eggs, sardines,fish, some greens, etc.) more specifically, in the past 45 days and lost around 5 more pounds (170 to 165). FYI I do not drink coffee, and I eat during a 4 hour window every day with 1 large meal around 6:00 (example: 3 1 pound grass-fed burgers with 2 eggs over easy, 2 bacon slices, and a side of olives/cucumbers or wild planet sardines) and a small meal around 8:30 (example: a little zucchini pasta with parm cheese on top) See my blood work results below. I am not concerned much for LDL, as we know that this is not inherently bad and has to do with particle size, high testosterone, etc. but as far as HDL and Trigs, I wish the ratio was better. let me know our guys' thoughts...Maybe exercising more would help with trigs? Not sure... I would also appreciate any other comments anyone has on the rest of the blood results, if any. Thanks!

keto,Keto and lactose intolerance!,"Hello! 

So, I thought it would be interesting to start a post where everyone can discuss how they are meeting their fat requirements while also staying away from milk. As someone who is lactose intolerant, I find it hard to meet fat requirements for keto as most keto recipes call for some kind of milky product to boost the fat content. I typically stay away from alternative milks and yogurts as well, so it really puts me in a bind of not using any “milk” based product. I understand the concept of healthy fats like avocados and nuts, but you literally have to eat so much of those to get to the fat requirements in a ketosis diet that it is ridiculous. Thus, why I thought it would be neat if everyone can discuss how they go about achieving their fat requirement while also maintaining their lactose intolerance condition. It help me get ideas of how to reach my own ketosis goals but possibly help other people out as well. 

Anyway, I guess I'll start with my own suggestion. Coconut oil based fat bombs. They are versatile and can take on any flavor combo. I typically make a chocolate flavored one with some cocoa powder or chocolate protein powder. I’ve heard the peanut butter ones are to die for."

keto,Could keto and fasting help me pass my drug test that's in 3 weeks? (daily cannabis),"I 23F (5'4 - 125lb) will probably get hired for this engineering internship and smoke about 1-2 bowls every night before bed, sometimes not but for the most part. I lift weights every day, IF, and sometimes do keto. I want to see what I can start doing now (3 weeks in advance) to speed up the cleansing. 

I've heard lifting/cardio and drinking lots of water is beneficial if done in advance and counterproductive a few days before the test. 

**Since fasting and being in ketosis means you are actively burning fat, would those metabolites be flushed out of my system relatively quickly, if not daily?**

I'm hoping that eating healthy and keeping my stress levels down also helps."
keto,Ketones dropping dramatically.,"Hey guys!
I have just recently started keto (I have done keto before) but one thing I’ve never understood is why my ketones drop so dramatically after eating the slightest amount of carbs (around 10g).
My ketones this morning were 1.4, then I ate some low carb/sugar free pancakes which were 5.6g carb per serve. I also took into account any traces of carbs in my sugar free syrup and cream. 
About an hour after eating, I tested again - 0.2!

keto,Keto doesn't seem to be working for me...?,"(f, 5""3 tall, 21 yrs) 

Hello! :) I'm currently 129lbs and looking to go down to 120 or 115. I've been keto for a month, low carb for two months. 

I've been eating exactly 25g net carbs daily (or often less) for a month now. I've restricted my calories to about 1,250 per day and have followed through the whole time; I track everything I eat with an app. I've also started drinking more water. 

I've done the strip test- my ketones are usually 4.0 to 8.0 and have been for a while. 
I also take extra ketone supplements in the morning and evening. 
Plus, to get over this plateau, I've started fasting too. I've been doing 14/10 for about 5 days now and still, the scale stays the same. 
I do light exercise- 20 mins cardio/ 30 mins weights three times a week. 

I've barely lost any weight... So far the loss total is about 1.5 lbs. 
The only significant change is that I get full a lot faster with less food, which is nice I guess. 
I was under the impression that keto made weight drop rapidly. Are there any reasons as to why this might not be happening with me? Is there anything else I can do to encourage fat burning? Anything I am forgetting? 

Thanks for any input!! :))"
keto,What is this😥?? Please help it is ruining my life 😞. Feeling nauseus all the time and can barley eat anymore...,"
Hi 

Little over a month ago i transitioned from a keto diet to a ”regular” diet because i wanted to enjoy myself with some candy and i didn’t feel like restricting anything anymore , it was fun at first and i was eating a bunch of chocolate and icecream almost every day , untill about a week ago. 

One day i waked up feeling very nauseus in the morning and i though it might have been food posioning from some really old garlic ive had the day before but the nausea didn’t go away. Almost every morning i wake up i feel very nauseus and unable to eat , it has been going on for weeks now 🥲.

This is very unusual for me since i use to like food and always think about tasty chocolate and stuff in the morning , but now i start getting slightly hungry around 7 - 9 hours after i wake up and when i do eat i am barley able to enjoy the food and i get filled up after a few bites and feel like i am gonna be sick😥...


What could be causing this? Diabetes/ketoacidosis? Food intolerance because i added a bunch of stuff i am not used to? 


Gender : male
Height : around 170 cm
Age : around 19
Smoking : no
Known disease : i don’t think so 😔"
keto,Trying to kill the sugar demon,"I was doing so good on my keto diet about a month ago, and it was great but then the home environment shifted and so did my diet.

keto,"I lost 70 pounds 1st keto experience, back for 2nd","So, back in 2018, I had reached 280 pounds. Im a 30 year old male, 6’2 . A friend of mines wife actually had lost a lot of weight so my wife and I tried it, it was hard at first, but we stuck with it, we went thru the ups and downs, the after cheat guilt, learning to just bounce back after those days, it was amazing. From February 2018 to August 2018 I lost 80 pounds. I didn’t do one minute of exercise during that entire period. August 2018 we went on vacation, decided we weren’t gonna NOT eat carbs on vacation, we fell off the wagon. 

Fast forward to the pandemic, my wife is pregnant, I’ve pretty much put all weight back on at this point, however a month before the world shut down, I was actively playing basketball 3 times a week. Nothing Major tho, didn’t really lose any weight. Once the world shuts down, I get a treadmill and i start to run every morning, still eating carbs, snacking on candy and cake at night, but I lose about 25 pounds, I quit smoking. Most importantly, I’ve developed the habit of working out and running 5-6 times a week. 

I catch Covid in January, that took me down for 2 weeks, and I gained that weight back (25 I had lost). I still run and do sets of push ups 3-5 times a week, but I believe my poor diet is why I can’t lose any weight.

keto,Temporarily reducing protein in favor of fats?,"I don't eat most meat (I mainly eat seafood and protein shakes) so my protein intake isn't very flexible.  For the first 90 days I loved this diet because I could eat as much shrimp and fish as I wanted, but now I'm starting to get burnt out on my favorite foods.

Last week I went on a two-day fast to give myself a break from all the protein.  While it really accelerated my weight loss, it hasn't fixed the protein burnout.  It also really lowered my appetite, which makes it even harder to force protein down my throat.

From what I've read, I really need to get my caloric intake back to normal for a couple days to recover from that fast, but I just can't do it with protein right now.  I struggled to get down 1600 calories yesterday when I was hoping to get up to 2000.  Beyond that, in order to recover from the protein burnout I think I'd need at least a week away from the foods that are giving me trouble.  

How bad would it be if I significantly dropped my protein intake and replaced it with fats for a week or two (while sticking to the carb limit)?"

Corona hit and quarantine weight kept creeping up. I was depressed, sitting at home and thought I could do lazy keto with cheat days and now I’m up about 25 pounds from my lowest weight. Feeling worse than ever.

For some reason I cannot get back to my super strict, always less than 20 grams of carbs way of keto I did before. Likely because I’m working at home all day and have no activities to distract me in my daily life like before... 

In the past week, however, I’ve been tracking my food on MyFitnessPal and usually my macros come out to 40-50g of carbs and 30ish grams of fiber. Does this mean I should be in ketosis? Everything I eat now is what I ate before when doing strict keto, just I’m eating more of it... Haha

I know net carbs is carbs minus dietary fiber. But if I eat let’s say (an exaggeration) 100g of carbs and 80g of dietary fiber, wouldn’t that be too many carbs??? Or does the fiber really outweigh it that much?"

keto,Getting back after over a month’s break. Any tips to get restarted?,"Quick background:

Started keto mid September 2020 and coupled it with IF. 

Took a break of a little over a month because of a lot of things including stress from work, losing some sight of things. 

I am getting back into it after that time and I’d love to hear some tips from others who have done something similar? 

I’m planning to restart my 10k steps daily (will start from 5500 tomorrow) and get back on keto and IF. I’ll start with 16:8 and move up in 15 days I guess. 

Here’s a picture of me wearing the same [red bodycon dress](https://imgur.com/a/SnOilE6) after a month. This gives me a push. And this helps me build back my discipline.

Signing off and hoping to get a positive update in a month to yall!"
keto,Recommendations for Keto Diet Plan,Hi all! I'm looking for a good clean keto meal plan for my Kindle.  I need a daily menu plus a shopping list.  I've done keto before but I'm trying to help my husband lose some weight.  I was kind of a know it all but we were following my ideas and I can't seem to get him into ketosis per his KetoMojo readings.  Any recommendations are greatly appreciated!
keto,Need help finding specific snack,"Hi!

I was at a coffee shop in Washington a year or two ago, and I bought this keto pastry. I can’t remember the name of it, but it came prepackaged and was very soft, square, and had like a banana flavour, a raspberry flavour I think, and one other one. It wasn’t any sort of poptart or smartcake. For the life of me I can’t figure it out! I think it was marketed as a breakfast thing, but it was pretty sweet."
keto,Hi everyone just asking some questions,"Hi im 19m and in June 2020 I was 330lbs at 5'9"" I went to work a seasonal job and I met a guy there who started to talk to me about keto and how I would love it and at first I didn't believe him and I was doubtful I wasn't will to change my eating habits but after a week of thinking I decided I would try it out for a month and see how it goes I didn't weigh myself for awhile (Never had a scale) so I didn't feel like I was making progress but in December I weighed myself for the first time and I had lost 30lbs I was amazed and I loved avoiding carbs so I'm still doing it to this day and I weighed myself 11days ago I was 220lbs today I'm 185lbs I'm getting worried about how rapid I'm losing weight is it normal?

keto,How important is it to actuallu meet your fat macros?,"I've been doing keto for 13 days, and have no issues meeting my carb and protein macros, however i do find it diffilcut to meet my fat macro of 130+ grams.

keto,Looking for a buddy/motivator,"Hi everyone,

My name is Pieter and im 20 years old 
The last few weeks I've been struggling with myself, not being happy anymore,  and afraid to look in the mirror. 
I have a past of struggling with weight.  I have tried different plans and strategies but I noticed I quit within a week. One time I lost 10 kg by using a diet plan and help from a trainer who kept me motivated. And I think that's something I miss.

Therefore I am looking for someone that is willing to be my motivator or buddy in my process to change. Someone that is willing to help me creating a solid keto program and just keep me motivated by chatting to me about the progress
It's quite something to ask, and I'm happy to pay the person something for its services. 

If this is something you would be interested in to do? feel free to contact me"
keto,Looking for motivation? Inspiration? A kick in the ass?,"TL/ DR - I’m being lazy and pouting and need to stop. Tell me how stupid I’m being. 

I have been at keto/low carb for 5 years, maybe 7, feels like eternity. I have been put on it by my endocrinologist for insulin resistant PCOS. But I have found it helps my endometriosis, fat infiltration in my liver/pancreas, joint pain, and weird heart palpitations &amp; pins/needles that no one can find the cause of. I have lost 30 lbs once, 20 lbs another time. You would think that I’d be like “okay, this is awesome, this is forever” but no. I keep pushing back against it even though I know how much I need it. It even lowers my anxiety. 

I’m 5’3”, I’m in the normal BMI (where the endocrinologist wants me at least) at 140 lbs, I feel healthiest at 115-125. I know this because I spent until 23 around that and have been back there since. I get to 168 or so and freak out. I go back to keto, calories between 1250-1350 and tracking everything. Once I get to a reasonable weight (135-140) I get lazy again. My hubby isn’t keto so there’s ALWAYS temptation around and that makes getting solid no cheating time for more than 4-5 days a challenge for me. I can do it, I have done it but I’m so blah right now. I feel like a teenager refusing to do what my mom says (I’m the teenager and the mom). I even packed all his non-keto food into boxes in the pantry so I can’t get into it so now I overeat keto food. I can’t even get back to my IF. 

If I was talking to a friend I would give them crap and help them conquer this. The problem is I am that friend for others but I don’t have one back. Please shame me and give me shit. Tell me how stupid I’m being. Honestly I need this but I’m a nice person so my loved ones are nice, even when I need them to be mean."
keto,Keto and intermittent fasting,"I started Keto and IF (23:1) together a little over a month ago. I had ""keto flu"" for about 2 weeks. Then I felt amazing. The last 4 or 5 days. I've felt awful while eating. I'll start eating, then began gagging, and feel like I'm gonna vomit after a few bites. So I just quit eating, and drink water. I haven't felt hungry, but my calorie intake has been between about 200-400 since this issue began. In comparison I was eating 1100-1400 before. Has anyone else experienced something similar, and how long did it last?

I usually eat between 3:30 and 4:30 everyday, so just the one meal, and felt great. I was able to do mild exercises and focus well at work daily."
keto,keto and my vision,"For context, I am 18F, 5'2, 130lbs. I started keto a few days ago to lose some winter fat, but I also noticed that my vision has been really odd lately. I have had 20/20 vision my entire life and could see possibly *too* well. A few days ago, either the day I started keto or the day after, I was driving, and I noticed I couldn't read street signs how I used to. Then it became difficult to read what was across the grocery aisle. I am experiencing long-distance vision problems.

I did get a mild keto flu around day 2, which was pretty much fatigue, but that was over in a day or so. The vision problems have persisted. I scheduled an eye exam for next Tuesday because I am so freaked out.

Thank you in advance!"
keto,Is it okay to eat carbs if it's not that much?,So I've started  the keto diet and some of the foods I eat still have some carbohydrates if not very many grams. For example I ate a salad that had a total of 3 g of carbohydrates and while I know that that isn't very much I want to make sure that I'm not messing up on the diet by eating carbs at all. I always try to keep my carbs under 10 g per day but I want to make sure that like I said I'm not messing up my diet.
keto,Über Serious Science-y Try,"So I'm starting my 3rd SERIOUS keto run (1st did cold turkey of sugar and carbs: was a horrible experience, 2nd did sugar first then carbs: was much better and did well lost 25 pounds over 3 months but still felt constant cravings and fell off). This time I stopped having sugar/sugar substitutes altogether 2 weeks ago and am fasting/cleansing/ purging all the carb craving gut germs from my system THEN doing keto in about a week or two. To help with the hunger, I've been drinking a TON of water (don't drink much water to begin with like maybe .5-1liter a day, which I suspect is why I consistently felt cravings on attempt 2). Yesterday was pretty bad even with drinking 1 gallon of water so today I drank 2 gallons (I don't plan on continuing was just to see how much I should be drinking in between 1-2 gallons) today. My questions are these: I know for me (especially after these past few days) I need to drink between 1-1.5 gallons on a fast, should I be drinking 1 gallon on normal days? How much on exercise days (getting into and starting running, cycling, and swimming for a micro triathlon day? Should I just drink when I'm thirsty (I eat only when hungry and not at a regimented time)? Am I even cleansing/purging the right way? How do I purge all the unnecessary water weight?

keto,Replacing carbs with healthy fats,"What do you guys usually eat for lunch?

keto,Is there a good keto meal prep delivery service?,I hate cooking and grocery shopping but I’m getting bored of the same takeout and would like some options besides my usual steak.

keto,How to loose faster,"Hi, i am really insecure about my body and every time I leave the house it sucks. Im 230 now , started at 240. I’m 5,10. I want to loose weight faster because I want to get to the point Where I’m not anxious about it anymore. That would be at 200 pounds at least.  I eat 2 keto meals  until I’m full everyday. That’s usually around 1200/1400 cal. I also fast and push my eating window into an 8 hour chunk. How can I loose faster? Is it smart to try and cut my calories anymore? I’m not hungry at all throughout the whole process wich is surprising. I’ve never been on a diet Whare I wasn’t starving."
keto,"What losing 190lbs looks like SW 390 cw 199.4 5'8""","It happened today after 2.5 years. Onederland!
 
Hit a major major milestone today! 
 I have now lost very nearly half my weight. Started at 390lbs. 
When I started I did not actually think I would achieve this. It was a pipe dream. I never voiced my goal because I didn't want to explain when I didn't reach it. I would say I was going to lose as much as I could but when things were slow or plateaued I would think...am I doing my best? Is this the best I could? And It wasn't then I changed it up and worked harder. I took it in 10 lbs goals, would take a picture and start another 10 lb goal. 
I am absolutely floored.
I went from a size 26 pant and 4x top to 14 pant and L\XL top. 
I went form walking with a limp with daily pain and strain unable to walk down stairs to actively seeking out exersize. 

This journey has made me reassess my own limiting beliefs about what I am capable of if I just don't give up. I am a head of household with a teen vegitarian and hubby and kiddo who eat a conventional diet.I have days all the time where I eat more than I should or lower quality but every morning is a fresh start and continuity over time = success
So for those struggling, that's ok, just pick it back up at your next meal, do the best you can and keep going. Even if the path seems slow, just don't quit. Here is my favorite poem that was followed me through my adult years and is framed in my house. 

When things go wrong as they sometimes will,
When the road you're trudging seems all up hill,
When the funds are low and the debts are high
And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,
When care is pressing you down a bit,
Rest if you must, but don't you quit.
Life is strange with its twists and turns
As every one of us sometimes learns
And many a failure comes about
When he might have won had he stuck it out;
Don't give up though the pace seems slow—
You may succeed with another blow.
Success is failure turned inside out—
The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,
And you never can tell just how close you are,
It may be near when it seems so far;
So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit—
It's when things seem worst that you must not quit.
This poem is in the public domain.

 So thank you all for your ongoing support, this is a life-changing journey to wellness and I'm so incredibly grateful.

Now off to my massage for my reward. 😁

keto,What's the scientific/technical explanation for why junk food cravings practically go away on keto?,"Before keto when my basic strategy was to watch my carbs and calories but still have cheat food here and there, looking at a Ziploc bag of freshly-baked chocolate chip cookies from the neighbor, or the still-hot delivery pizza with soft garlic breadsticks, would set off all types of red alarms and tempt me. It was like the battle of good vs. evil in my own head. And 50% of the time my will wasn't powerful enough, the food won.

I've noticed that with keto however, and a consistent pattern of keeping under 25g of carbs a day, I can now look at that bag of cookies or that box of pizza and just go about my business. I'll give them 3 seconds of my attention and then I move on and forget about it, focusing on my chicken breast and broccoli and never feeling like I'm dying inside.

Why is that exactly? Is it psychological?"
keto,Made it to Onederland!,"This morning I stepped on the scale and I was ecstatic to see that the number was 199.5.  I honestly don't remember the last time I was in the 100s, it has definitely been over 10 years.
I decided I needed a whole life style change and started on January 1st weighing in at 223lbs.  In doing my research I read that this way of eating will also help with PCOS, so aside from weight loss that was another reason why I decided to change my lifestyle. I have had 0 cheat days, and I am glad I no longer have cravings for anything I used to eat.
I mainly lurk on here and I enjoy reading the success stories on here, so I thought I would share my first success story.  I still have about 34 more lbs to go for my first big goal weight, and my motivation is not slowing down at all.  
Thank you to everyone in this community for keeping me motivated! KCKO"
keto,What is this rash?,"Hey guys, I've been starting my weightloss journey about two months ago. Unfortunately I started getting those really nasty rashes all over my body. They are really itchy and I get bad hives when scratching them. They form on the stomach, my chest, my neck, my legs, thighs, arms. Everywhere, besides my backside. 

http://imgur.com/a/QaWBDAE

I'm doing alternate day fasts and I'm hitting ketosis in between my refeeds. During refeeds I eat in a 500 calorie deficit. 
I have thought about it potentially being a keto rash but I've don't keto before for over a year and never gotten those kind of reactions. 

Today I went hiking and it was physically quite demanding. Before the hike, I had no rash at all. After the hike I looked like a dalmatian.

I'm planning on seeing a dermatologist soon but I gotta wait a few weeks for that appointment. 

Has anyone ever gotten a similar rash? Anyone knows what's going on with me? Perhaps too high cortisol levels?

Thank you!"

Aldi is the closest but have never been there for some reason. 

Lidl is a newer German grocery store that juts opens and I hear is just like aldi

Trader Joe’s is going to be an hour drive big if it’s worth it, I will make the drive.

keto,"Keto vs very low carb for hormones test, sbgh ect","How much different is free and total test on a low carb diet with adequate protein and fat vs a stricter ketogenic diet with plenty of protein and fat. Are the blood tests going to be that much different?


I’m seeing a doctor soon. Going to get hormone panels done and I was doing keto. It was really helping me honestly , but I don’t need to lose weight and I don’t know if I would stick to it forever..


Optimally is like to do keto with some nuts and berrys, and lower carb fruit maybe an apple or orange every once in a while. Maybe a sweet potato here or there,l. Some beans garlic and onions. Just have more of a varied diet, but still basically able to go in and out of ketosis. just to break ketosis for a second and then go back into it.. but it seems to be very hard to  do that you know.


It seems to be an all or nothing kinda thing with carbs.. unless I did strict keto for a while and just threw it in in very small anmounts every once in a while.

Anyway I’d like to go back to strict keto but I want blood tests to be somewhat accurate and fairly normal. Also going to be seeing a counselor and psych as I struggle with some mental illness issues. 


You see I don’t want ketosis to mask problems and then have them if I come off it for a bit. I can always come back to ketosis later as a tool, but I want to deal with the issues I have..

I still always eat clean, exercise , ect I was just wondering how much of a difference keto would make. I would be eating at maintence on keto as I feel very bad under I suppose untill I adapted. 

Let me know what you think. Is there a better way to adapt to extremely low carb while not being keto?"

keto,Any keto recommendations for people that have a hard time swallowing food?,"Hi there keto-peeps,

So, my mother has been doing the keto diet for a couple years now due to having a sensitivity towards gluten and other bread products. About a year ago, she was diagnosed with esophageal webbing, which can make it very difficult for her to swallow and keep down food. She’s lost a lot of weight because of her limited food choices, and she has to take many supplements because of her condition. Tonight we wanted to go out because my brother just came back into town to visit, but I’m not entirely sure what foods would be most appropriate for her because of the webbing, and she cannot eat anything with too many carbs (again, the sensitivity). 

If anyone has any suggestions on what foods and/or restaurants would be most friendly under these circumstances, please let me know. I am not keto personally, so I don’t really know where to start or what food to consider and not consider (aside from gluten). Thank you!

edit: grammar"
keto,Today's my 6th month Keto-versary!,"I never thought I would be able to keep this up. I'm usually the person that gives up or gets bored after a few weeks. 

I started Keto September 13 2020 through a Keto Coach because I wanted to be educated and guided throughout the process. She coached me for the first 8 weeks, and I taught I will be back for more but everything she's taught me stuck and still produced results till this day. And I'm so glad I made that decision 6 months ago. 

After 6 months, I've lost 24.2 kg from my SW of 106.9kg. I'm just amazed how far I've come. 

To those who haven't started, there's no other day better than today. Just make the decision and stick to it. 

Hope I'm still at it by September 13, 2021 and perhaps already in my goal weight. 😊"

keto,Kicking the carbs (or how I learned to love meat wrapped meat with a side of meat),"Long time lurker and follower here.  31m/6'1""/SW304/CW201/GW199

I started keto in Sept last year after an eye opening doctor visit in which I had high-ish blood pressure (150/90).  Doctor told me off it got any higher, I would need to medicate. Kind of shocked me as I am fairly young but I knew I was eating like a garbage dump raccoon and drinking like a fish.  I don't know how it happened but the weight packed on and I pretty much became sedentary.  I used to be fairly active playing sports and running but it went by the wayside.  I brought up keto to my doctor and they were very supportive as they do it too!  Had some helpful tips to get started.

Coincidentally, my wife was just starting her keto diet so I figured what the heck. I knew I had to do something, anything. For me, the hardest part is starting something.  I decided to take on this diet as well.  Win-win, supportive of my wife and getting my body back in check.  I decided that there was no other way, psychologically committed to the cause.  

I always liked cooking so I just had to switch up what meals to make.  Sub out the pasta and potatoes for cauliflower and spinach.  Spend more at the grocery store for more proteins.  I didn't go crazy trying to make keto this out that, just making meals that didn't have many carbs.  No need to make a complicated and expensive keto cake, just have a different type of dessert, jello with whipped cream or berries with Greek yogurt.  Find something you do like, don't try to  I did have one cheat day since the beginning and TBH, the food was not as good as I remember and my body felt like garbage for an entire day afterwards.  In general, I have gravitated towards cooking and eating foods with less processing.  However, carb friendly tortillas have been a life saver to keep things interesting.  Use it as a wrap, quesadilla, homemade CRUNCHY chips with whatever seasoning you like (everything bagel seasoning is where it's at).  No noticeable effect to my weight loss or energy levels after eating two or three a week.

I kicked alcohol or of my diet all together.  Simply put, it would have interfered with achieving my goals.  

As for exercise, I decided I needed to get back into it. Commit to doing something every day.  Remember I mentioned running earlier, I knew I liked it from years ago, I just had to start again. The first run was awful - and a good reminder of how bad of shape I was in.  Starting slowly jogging to the stop light down the street, then the next one, then the next one...I eventually started developing a bit of runners knee.  I decided to dust off my bicycle that laid dormant for years, give my knee a break.  Almost instantly I remembered that I really liked riding.  Wind in my face, covering lots of ground.  I ended up alternating between bicycling and running 7 days a week at varying intensities and durations.  Fast forward a little bit.  I worked up to running 25-35 miles a week.  A few weeks ago, I ran my longest run ever at 8 miles.  Kind of encouraged my recent bout of runners knee unfortunately.  I have been taking it easy just trying to get a bunch of steps around the house until it is feeling better, then slowly bring back the running.  May break out the bicycle now that it is getting warmer again.  This may be the first time I've actually worn out the soles on a pair of running shoes.  Brooks adrenaline by the way, I needed the best for running while being 300 pounds 😆.  Every joint takes a pounding.

As for clothes, I started in XXL and 42 pants, now down to L and 34.  I had to replace most of my wardrobe.  I had to hit up some thrift stores to not go broke buying all new stuff along the way.  Now that I am near my maintenance, I will start slowly upgrading with the end of season specials.  

In total I am down 103 pounds in just over 6.5 months.  A third of my starting body weight.  It was aggressive but I followed the guidance here and kept to it.  Calories were around 40% deficit most days.  Some days I would eat all the way up to maintenance though.  I started doing 16/8 IF somewhere along the way, which helped a ton to not be hungry all of the time.  I tried OMAD which resulted in even less calories going in, I would get full too fast.  Now I am up to 1700 calories until breaking through 200lbs and dial in my maintenance calories, estimating around 2300 not accounting for exercise.  I will probably stick with IF.  I like having a few spare calories budgeted for smaller snacks throughout the day.  

Transitioning to maintenance will be the next challenge.  My wife is still in loss mode so it will be easy to keep the house keto safe.  I do plan to start strength training. I did lose a bit of muscle mass with the aggressive deficit and frequent cardio.  I have read that the runners knee could be helped by building up leg muscle, bring stability to the area.  Bicycling (instead of running), and body weight lunges and squats helped the first time.

I wanted to share my story to help out others that are where I was 6 months ago.  I was going to wait for the onederland post in a couple weeks, but, why wait to spread good news, especially when it can help others achieve their goals.

Please let me know if you have any questions or thoughts.  Even just lurking and reading all of the inspirational stories and commiserations in this sub helped me. I am glad to give back however I can."

A couple of minor bumps along the way (read:beer and those double-damned Costo ""protein bars"" that they changed the recipe on) but still a pretty steady decline.  

Unexpectedly, my weight began to reverse course.  Despite best attempts, I actually gained 4 pounds.   
 I started examining everything that I was eating...nothing.  I use Keto Stix....in moderate Keto.  I had even purchased a cheap blood sugar monitor and been using that consistently....in the 80s.  Real head-scratcher and frustrating as hell. Then last night I was taking my meds and suddenly took note of a new one.  I looked it up and, sure enough, weight gain was a side-effect.  Wow.  

Obviously, I am not suggesting that anyone stop taking medications.  This is a PSA so that you can examine your specific scenario and have a meaningful conversation with your doctor about alternative medications.  I am making modifications and will let you know how it goes."

Carbs: between 15g-18g
Calories: up to 1200

keto,Almost a week in - Exploring bread.,"For the last 5 days I have been researching breads to replace white bread, and so far the results have left me a bit disheartened.

I've mostly experimented with 90 second keto bread.

To clarify, anytime someone in an article or a video boasts on how delicious something is I become skeptical, when they use the phrase (In relation to non-keto items) *""So much better than \_\_\_\_\_""*  I become extremely weary. Like when someone at the table is eating under a new meal plan and continue exclaiming how delicious it is, it's like, *are you trying to convince us or trying to convince yourself?*

Almost all recipes share the same ingredients, and seeing them in action they seem to yield similar results in relation to texture; stiff, dense, dry and mealy, it always looks like they area tearing/biting into styrofoam.

I am only 19 years old, I’m a stay at home online college student so I am not too active, luckily I have a home workout room with machines and I workout everyday, sometimes skip weekends.
What I will say to people who are starting and or feeling discouraged about keto. DO NOT quit when you see the scale stay the same. There has been times where my weight stayed the same for a couple weeks, and it will happen. If you aren’t losing weight on keto the simple answer is, you are eating too much. I found that out the hard way. 
I use 0 net carb bread from my local grocery store is I want a egg/bacon sandwich every once and a while or I’m just craving some toast, it really helps with my cravings because I was a bread lover. I have also been using zero sugar ketchup it is expensive like the bread (idk why) if anything it should be cheaper right haha, but they both taste the same to me as if I was eating the real thing. I don’t make or buy low carb desserts or ice cream, I might try the keto ice cream on a special occasion some day but I do not want to start a habit and end up over eating. Substitutes are great, just don’t over eat, is the lesson I learned. 

I’d post pictures of my progress but I don’t think it let me on this forum and I’m pretty née to Reddit so I don’t know the rules."
keto,Extreme Tiredness,"It seems like ever since I started this diet, I've been able to sleep in easily 3-4 hours past the time my alarm goes off and I still feel tired for hours.

keto,Accountability post,"Time to get started

Hi dear community of Reddit, I have been a long time lurker and last week I decided to five hard in to Keto after being shocked by me recent weight gain.

SW: 144 kg ( 317 pounds )
CW: 140.5 kg ( 309 pounds )
GW: 95kg ( 209 pounds )
Height: 192cm ( 6”3 )
Age: 28 
Sex: love it
Gender: male

As I am writing this down I realize I have a 100 pounds to loose, that’s a scary amount but I have never been more motivated. I will do a ones a month update for accountability

Background: I have been big all my life, I was a big baby 5kg ( 11 pounds, poor mom) and then a overweight toddler/child/teenager/young adult etc. I would say that I have been about the same size competitively to my height since I was 9 or 10 years old.

I have never tasted the sweet nectar of being a normal size, I have been trying to loose the weight all my life but I never had the motivation to do something long term and always kept falling back in to my old habbits. 

This time it has to be different, I recently became a first time parent. I want to have energy and to do a fulltime job being a father and a good spouse to my lovely fiancé I have to keep it up this time."

keto,I hit my target maintenance weight today! 5’8M/31/200.1SW/165CW/160GW,"I hit my long term target weight of 165 this morning! Been OMAD keto since late October. My plan has been to get to 160 before adding carbs back in. 

I actually still like keto and fasting. I eat primarily fatty protein and when I’m good about it some veggies cooked in oil or butter. 

I’m having a hard time deciding how to move forward in maintenance. I don’t miss carbs too much in my normal routine, but I would love to eat some high carb food now and again.

Is a 4-5 day on keto, 2 day off kind of schedule realistic cycling from keto to high carb and back, or will that make me feel shitty?"

Anyway, after i quit, i went up alot in weight and eating right next do working out, i cant seem to lose weight, its impossible.

keto,What is happening?!?!,"Hey guys!

So first off, I am no stranger to the keto lifestyle and I previously lost 95lbs over the course of about 18 months. 

HOWEVER, when quarantine happened a year ago and I started working from home, I eventually adopted some not too great eating habits and I was no longer up and moving as much as I was when I was in my office. I will say though that I did not completely backslide, I was trying to be smart about it and bought seedy whole grain breads and chickpea pasta instead of the traditional stuff. This all led to me gaining about 40lbs back. I have come to the realization that my body just does not work best when eating these types of foods. I was feeling groggy and unmotivated and just overall terrible all the time. 

About a month ago, I started back on my keto journey and I have only dropped 4lbs in that time. One of the things I am doing differently this time is that I am using Carb Manager to actually keep track of what I eat. I am staying under the carb level that I have set (26g though I try to stay under 20g) and I am getting plenty of protein and fat.

Has anyone had this issue with restarting? I knew not to expect the same drop that I saw when I initially started keto a couple years ago as I am in better shape than I was then but 4lbs in a month still feels quite slow. I also still feel groggy and lazy most days."

Where on the continuum of ketosis can I expect with that macro?"

I have been keto off and on for about 10 years and I've heard people say ""never trust a fart"" around here, but I never had this issue so I kind of forgot about that sage advice.

Anyway, my patio is sparkling clean now."
keto,Bloated on keto diet,"
I gained a couple pounds, so a couple weeks ago I decided to try keto while being on a caloric deficit eating one meal a day. I used to regularly fast between 16 to 23 hours a day (for maintaining my weight while still eating junk), but I had been neglecting that for a couple of months and that’s why I gained the weight. I want to get back to my body I had a year ago, and since this diet I’m now actually a bit lighter than my previous weight. However, I still look heavier. My stomach looks constantly bloated, as if I just ate a huge meal. I’ve never had this before when I used to do IF with all kinds of food, my stomach would of course look bloated after my meal, but the next morning it would be gone. I drink more water, around 2L a day and what I’ve been eating is mostly: eggs, greek yogurt, olive oil, zucchini, eggplant, spinach, cashews, mozzarella, avocado, bell pepper. Is there anything else I can do? I still want to keep doing keto for health benefits, but if it will keep me bloated, I don’t know if this diet is suitable for me"

I'm going back to keto, and after a week, I noticed that I lost one pound of fat but also one pound of muscle.

What should I do? Should I stick with the same diet, or increase/decrease my protein intake?

keto,A complete transformation with my goal in sight,"Hello everyone! For reference I am a 27 yr old man 6’6”. 

My journey, like a lot of us here, started with a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/1d2xWwh.jpg). Summer of 2018. I was in a stressful unfulfilling job and eating my stress. This picture wrecked me when I saw it. So I resolved to cut back massively on sugar. I think I was around 310 or 320 at the time. 

Fast forward to summer of 2020. I had my stress better under control, but I still didn’t like the way I looked and felt at all. My doctor was starting to talk about cholesterol panels. Stuff was getting real. I got a scale and my weight was fluctuating between about 280 and 290 depending on the day. 

At the end of July 2020, I discovered keto by some random google searches and just figured I’d go for it! Those first weeks were super difficult, but the results have been incredible. This morning I weighed in at about 232, which is just12 lbs off of my goal of 220. Almost 60 lbs lost as of today. 

I don’t particularly recognize the person i see in the mirror, but I like the look of him a lot more! And hey, I actually don’t mind seeing pics of myself.

keto,Do you have to be in a caloric deficit to reach and maintain ketosis?,"I was looking at the nutritional value of a box of hamburger patties that I have, and each patty is roughly 300 calories. It got me thinking about caloric deficits and stuff. I saw some threads on here that said that the goal is to count carbs, not calories, but it’s got to matter at a certain point, right? If you were to eat 20 of those patties in a day, you’d still be under 20g carbs, but that would be 6000 calories. In your research and experience, is there a right amount of calories to consume in a day?"
keto,Am I doing keto wrong?,"Hello! To start off i wanna say I’ve done keto multiple times in the past &amp; I have always had good results. This time however is different.

I just weighed in for my first week and I’m only down 2.9lbs. I understand that’s still progress but in the past I’ve lost like 7lbs my first week. Is keeping my carbs as low as possible good or should I be trying to hit 20g?

So today I was shopping and came across a food scale for $30 bucks, I bought it. (Plan on returning it later today and ordering one off of Amazon because they're cheaper). 

GUYS! My eyes are open now, wide open. Weigh your food! **I was consuming more calories than I thought I was even though I was following the package instructions.** I'm absolutely gobsmacked that it took me this long to realize how beneficial a scale is. I'm feeling a little demotivated so I hope now in combination with using the food scale, some exercise and a good mentality that I'll see a SV or NSV. Could it really be as simple as using a food scale? We shall see!

For context, I'm F25, 5'2 and my macros are Protein 101g, Fat 85g and carbs 20g (most days I'm under 15g) - 1249 calories a day.

keto,"Keto has made me not feel ""sick"" anymore! + a friendly reminder to measure yourself","Hello all! I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder back in 2015. I was only 25 and didn't really understand how life changing it would be down the road. Getting a lifelong disease diagnosis is a lot to process. I dutifully took my medication daily and kind of left it at that. Then in 2019 things started to change. I started getting skin rashes (extremely dry skin), hair loss (I have A LOT of hair so it wasn't too bad until my hair dresser noticed my longer layers were much thinner), extreme fatigue, excessive bloating, weight loss problems, etc. I had just lost 10 lbs after moving from Seattle back to Sunny California. Now, I'm only 5'2 and I was stuck at 172 forever. I did a lot of crash dieting and rounds of whole30 and landed at 160 after 2 years and just kind of dealt with the symptoms above. I just assumed weight loss was always going to be hard and I'd yo-yo back and forth between 158 and 160. I weight far more than I look and my SO loves me and thinks I'm perfect the way I am. Yadda yadda  yadda, bless his heart, but this girl does not feel confident and sexy - and that needs to change. Anyway - I spent the last year tracking every single thing I ate and every last calorie burned. It was so exhausting and I saw zero scale movement. Dieting is hard AF when you're in a relationship. I don't know about you, but going out to eating and seeing all the yummy fatty ""no good' items on standard diets SUCK. Keto was the only thing I hadn't tried so I said f\*\*\* it. Let's try it. I weighed in at 159.8. I'm only on day 8, but good god. I woke up this morning feeling energized for the first time in SIX YEARS. My skin rashes are clearing up, my dark circles (which are made far worse by my disease) are lightening, my skin looks brighter, and my bloating is down. I didn't have a lot of water weight drop off during my first week (-3 LBS), but as of this morning I shed a whopping 9 INCHES overall. 9 inches of bloating off of my body. This is your reminder to not just weight yourself, but MEASURE yourself. If I only saw that I dropped 3 lbs of water weight in week one I would've stayed motivated, but seeing 9 inches gone is what truly motivates me. It's just the start of my journey, but I'm excited to see where I end up. Even more so excited that all those yummy fatty ""no good"" items on standard diets are now my ""yes please and more"" items. Thanks for reading!"
keto,Advice about macro calculator and work...,"I work at Walmart as a stocker, 40 hrs a week. I feel like it is pretty active, i am moving constantly. Especially since there is a time frame I have to meet and usually we are understaffed.

I did keto for a little while but just lazy keto. With walking, too, I had lost 50+ lbs but now I'm back to where I was before. I know I'm active enough to lose weight, I just need to tackle the diet lifestyle. Makes it hard when I work in a grocery store and currently live on energy drinks working overnights.

But this thing.. wow... my first reading yesterday was 113, ok decent - I had eaten an hour before hand. My next was 145. Even though I hadn't eaten.  Ok that might have been an error. Then this morning when I woke up it was 108 and 3 hours later it was only 99. (99 after 15 hours fasting).

To me this has to mean that the reading is off up to 20% from what is should be.

keto,Over a month in - hard time figuring out macros so I'm not starving all the time.,"I started Keto 2/4/21, and have not cheated once since then. Most days under 20 net carbs, the most I've done on a more relaxed day was up to 30 but not over.

I got rid of every single thing in my house that wasn't keto friendly when I started which has helped immensely. I haven't been tempted to eat non keto food even though I'm around it all day and stopped really missing carbs and sugar after the first week. I feel really good!

However, I am really struggling need some help. While I am losing weight, it is slow and have lost about four pounds in just over a month.

I read the sidebar carefully and calculated my macros.  [You can view them here.](https://imgur.com/a/LWtULBX)

I set it to sedentary even though I'm definitely not. I work full time at Costco and am on my feet for eight hours a day, five days a week. I work in various departments and am sometimes lifting for several hours a day. I get over 15,000 steps regularly.

The problem is I am SO HUNGRY when eating 1700 calories. I know this isn't really a problem, as long as I am getting the nutrients I need and enough protein. But I am finding myself so hungry by the evening when I get home from work that I am eating before bed and pushing my calories above 2000, stalling my weight loss.

I am trying to delay my first meal of the day to my first break at work, so between 12:00- 2:00pm, hoping that will help me stay at my calorie goal. I have been doing Keto Chow at 530 calories per shake and I really love it. But I am hungry again two hours later, and have a hard time not eating again. I find myself at my calorie limit by the end of my shift, and when I get home at 8 -10 pm I am starving and eat another late snack or meal, going over my calories. (I go to bed around 1-2am)

Any ideas, suggestions?"
keto,Keto Works! 30 pounds gone so far. Pictures in post.,"I used to run marathons, but after 3 spinal fusion surgeries and thyroid issues my running days were over and I gained tons of weight.  I finally gave lazy keto a try in October, lost about 15 lbs, but went off for the holidays.  I started up again in February and lost another 15.  I still have 20 more to go, but today I put on a dress I haven't worn in 3 years and it felt so good!  Keto works guys!

keto,Family loses 300 pounds together in one year on low carb,"At Diet Doctor, we received an inspiring email from Deb and her family, who live in New Zealand. In just one year on a low-carb diet, they have lost 304 pounds (138 kilos) together.

What’s more, they have all improved their health greatly. Deb writes that “the health benefits are too numerous to say this doesn’t work.”

Here’s their story, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Deb and her family’s low-carb story

As a family, we’ve lived low carb for twelve months. My daughter and I have metabolic syndrome, both my children have autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and my husband has just been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS).

I really just wanted to share some progress photos to help encourage others. It’s not an easy lifestyle change, but my family and I have stuck to it since the improvements we have seen are encouraging.

Deb’s family on keto

We still have a way to go, especially my daughter and me. Before embarking on our low-carb journey, I was 389 pounds (176 kilos). Today, I weigh 267 pounds (121 kilos). My daughter was 276 pounds (125 kilos) and is now 209 pounds (95 kilos), my son was 231 pounds (105 kilos) and is now 194 pounds (88 kilos). He “cheats” a bit while at university – and my darling husband was 254 pounds (115 kilos) and is now 176 pounds (80 kilos).

The boys had less weight to lose but joined us girls to support us. Due to his autism, my son struggled with the new diet, as any kind of change is hard for those on the spectrum. But we will not go back; the health benefits are too numerous to say this doesn’t work.

My husband, my son, and I typically fast from dinner to mid-morning. The only family member who has breakfast is our daughter. She did not cope well with fasting and eats a coconut cream berry smoothie every morning.

Lunch is often homemade seed crackers from Diet Doctor, the ones made with sesame seeds. But I add other seeds such as sunflower and pumpkin. We eat these with cheese, cucumber, ham, etc.

Dinner is mostly meat, brassicas, and butter or cheese. Sometimes we have coleslaw with mayonnaise.

Every time we lose 22 more pounds (10 kilos), we treat ourselves to low-carb cheesecake. Since we’re on a strict budget, our foods are often low cost and simple. Also, my daughter has an almond allergy, so coconut flour is all we use.

We have salted peanuts daily and drink a lot of sparkling spring water. I also make a weekly low-carb coconut chocolate cake and low-carb chocolate mug cakes are a favorite, too.

The foods we eat daily are cauliflower, broccoli, and meat. We try to keep our carb count to under 50 grams daily. Maybe we are not the average low-carb family, especially since our diet is not as rich in fat as some — but we are certainly low carb.

Thank you for helping us with this journey.

Regards,

Deborah, Mark, Jessica, and Patrick.

keto,Help me understand,"I understand calories in calories out isn’t quite as black and white on keto. However. If you eat Loads of carbohydrate, he gets converted to fat. However, conversely, if I ate bucket loads of fat every day, and given that they state that this doesn’t get converted directly to fat, what would happen to the Excess fat that you eat? You don’t excrete it so where do you store it?"
keto,Cant get into ketosis..help please!,"Brand new to this.  My second week on keto. Sticking to my macros to a tee, aggressively tracking, drinking 100oz of water a day. Testing my blood daily and still haven't hit ketosis. Any advise? No clue what I could possibly be doing wrong.  TIA!!"
keto,Low Blood Sugar on Keto,"I've never had issues with low blood sugar. Lately, I've been ranging from 55 to 60 for my glucose. My ketones are great. I don't necessarily feel bad when my glucose is this low. I'm more concerned about safety.  This also happens more frequently when I fast. I'm aware of keeping up with electrolytes."
keto,Keto Munchies. Anyone else?,"First of all, this isn't anything related to drugs or alcohol (I've never had any of the two). Whenever I go keto -- or at least when I start -- I get this urge to bite or chew on something constantly. I get this urge to snack all the time. I think it comes with the ""keto fullness"". This is what I've called the ""floating in air"" feeling when you eat keto. It's like you are not hungry at all but you feel so light in the stomach. Which is wildly different from the ""carb fullness"" which is weighty and, dare I say it, satisfying.

Anyone else have the same experience?"
keto,For my fellow craft beer fans,"*link at the bottom*

For the record I am not sponsored or affiliated with the brand. This month I started eating low carb and so far I’m seeing good results. I feel more energetic and I’ve lost 7 lbs, but I’m definitely struggling with missing my favorite carb foods.. pasta, potatoes, and BEER. I’m a big craft beer fan, and used to buy a couple 6 packs to sip on throughout the week with dinner, while I cook, watching Netflix, etc. I picked up the habit in college working at a restaurant that specialized in craft beer and used to home brew, etc...

This week at the supermarket while picking up seltzers I saw the brand “Hoptea” and was instantly intrigued. I bought one (they come loose at my grocery store, not in a pack) and oh my, I loved it. I went back and tried a few more flavors and so far they’ve all been good! They are brewed tea, then dry-hopped, and carbonated. 0 calorie, 0 carb, 0 alcohol. They scratch the “habit” itch for me, doing things I’d usually do with a beer, but with no guilt. I’ll qualify that if you like beer for the alcohol, or if you like dark beer, it’s not going to be the same. But if you like a pale ale with dinner, they use the same hops as a pale ale would (some I used to use in my home brews!)

Def recommend checking it out if you miss a good pale ale, I’ll link where you can buy online for those who can’t find locally!

keto,Diet still working wonders with crashed testosterone.,"I’m about a month in on my first run with keto and I’m excited to see that my body isn’t losing weight/muscle it probably needs. Im a 5’11” male and skinny fat, floating between 170 and 190. I was placed on hrt a little over year ago and I fully stopped about 2 months ago for a number of reasons I’m happy to highlight in the comments. I’ve done no post cycle therapy but probably will once I visit my doctor next week. In short, my testosterone was terrible before going on Trt and it should be assumed to be worse or as bad now. Happy to update bloodwork next week when I know for sure though. 

I am completely thrilled at how beautifully everything is recomping. I haven’t dropped much below 170 which is very good for someone who can’t afford to lose any more muscle. I’m just watching the fat fall off. I’m also convinced my T levels have shot up quite a bit between the diet and the detox regiments I’ve been including. My testicles have been swollen and sore for a sustained period for the first time since getting off. I’m using ancestral supplements mofo formula which is probably the biggest helper. Between regularly pooping out gallstones, rising libido, better energy than I ever had on trt and the ridiculous fat loss, I’d say this has been an extraordinary success for only 3 1/2 weeks in. I was concerned this diet would be ineffective with crashed/out of wack hormones but that doesn’t seem to be the case. I’m feeling better than the best I ever felt on testosterone."
keto,Face changes,Hey! So I did keto for the first time last year for 3 months (lost 20 lbs) and then stopped for a little and just started back a week and a half ago. Has anyone else noticed once they stop keto that their face gets chubbier? I attribute it to swelling but it didn’t go away and it’s not like  l instantly gained back a bunch of weight. And now that I’ve started back my face slimmed down almost instantly. What is that about!? Any tips on coming off of it and not having your face swell up again?
keto,9 days on keto and I’m it’s awesome,I started keto 3/1/21 and I was at 220.. today I got on the scale and I am at 205. I know this most likely is water weight but this gave me so much motivation. Especially to keep walking 30 minutes a day. Can’t wait to reach my 1 month mark! My goal weight is 160
keto,I think I ****** up,"So, I sometimes drink a Bang energy drink every so often because...heart palpitations.  Mostly when I'm cracking under pressure and just want something sweet that isn't just Zevia or loose tea with stevia/monkfruit in it.  So I tried the new Monster Watermelon flavour (I don't care for Monster at all but watermelon flavoured anything is my kryptonite) and got the no-sugar one with sucralose and erythritol in it.

 After drinking it and adding it to my calorie counter, when I scanned the barcode, it said it wasn't keto friendly and to avoid (I use Carb Manager for reference). Which...confuses me.  Because if that's the case...Bang shouldn't be keto friendly either, right??  I read the ingredients and they're similar to Bang so...I might've fucked up without realizing and am just going to accept defeat if this will kick me out of my 3 month ketosis.  I do OMAD and already ate, so I'll just get back to my normal Zevia/loose tea schedule tomorrow. 😔😔"
keto,Roasted Chicken,"I bought a home chef roasted chicken from Kroger.  It was soooo delicious, and a quick easy dinner. That problem is, there was no nutritional information on the package. How many carbs do you think there were? I’ve tried googling it, and I am not getting a straight answer."
keto,YOU GUYS... BREAD,"I’m sitting here in a state of absolute disbelief. Now sure I love a good steak with some cauli mash as much as the next guy but what I really needed was a good old fashioned sandwich. I’d been using the Aldi bread— but could no longer stand it. Yeah, my mattress might be zero carbs too but that’s what I might as well have been putting my cold cuts on and eating. So today at Target I found a bread called CARBONAUT I don’t know why, it has nothing to do with space but it’s fucking good. I got the seeded one because I figured that’d give it some density and substance and I was right. I lathered it up with Mayo, lettuce, Swiss and turkey- threw on a Seinfeld episode and was in heaven. Didn’t even have a side which I normally would require. I thought I’d come here to maybe help one person escape the throes of Aldi- I’m gonna just say it. I hate it there. I hate the whole “culture” of it. I hate generic, hate the no bag thing, hate how rude they are, hate how they sit as they ring you up.. lol and most of all I hated the old memory foam mattress topper I was buying there to try and pretend I wasn’t in a loveless relationship with keto. But now I’ve been made whole."
keto,1 year on keto!,"I started keto late February 2020. It was a interesting start at first. I struggled finding foods I could take to work or having diffrent options for dinner. Once I found healthy good tasting options to eat it was alot easier. Since starting in February I have lost 104 pounds! I started at 315 lbs and feel amazing with the progress I have made. Trying this diet has been life changing and I hope this post can inspire other people to keep at it and not get discouraged. Feel free to ask me any questions :)

keto,Brain fog,"Hey everyone. So I’ve just started and only 15 days in and I’ve been dealing with MAJOR brain fog. Ex: Drove the 20 min to my dentist only to be reminded that my appt is tomorrow...

Which I’ve known. Been looking at. Read about  consistently the past few days. Checked multiple times to ensure it matches my new schedule. Yet here I was...LOL. This has been happening all week. What is happening?! Is this is a symptom any of y’all experienced?"
keto,Need help - reverted to binging,"I started off with keto in December 2020. I was doing great and barely felt hungry. It felt pretty easy and I enjoyed cooking new foods and trying out new recipes. I lost close to 40lbs between mid-December and end of March 2021 and was feeling great. I hit a low weight of 163lbs at 5'7"" and was getting close to the major milestone of being out of the ""overweight"" BMI category. As of this morning I am back at 170 after several binges starting last week. I craved chocolate, cookies and cake so badly that I went to the store and bought it. On the first bad binge day I bought a giant tub of sugar cookies, a package of 10 Little Debbie cakes, and a pint of caramel/chocolate Ben and Jerry's ice cream. By the time I made it home I had eaten half of the cakes and half of the cookies. I had a moment of clarity and went to the trash chute at my apartment and threw away the ice cream and the remainder of the cookies. I still ate the rest of the cakes. A couple of days later I bought chocolate and bread and binged it in one night. Up until this point I was able to control myself around the keto friendly high calorie foods that I had on hand but I have been scooping out spoonfuls of peanut butter and eating tons of cheese. I even cooked two cups of pasta and ate that today. I am afraid of what the scale might say tomorrow. I wouldn't doubt that I am back up to 175. 

How do I fix this and get back on track. I hate myself.

keto,This can't be right????,"So I started keto 5 days ago and went to a 1200 cal diet per my dr. I avoid the scale like it's the plague but for some reason decided today was a good day. When I got on the number was unexpected, I checked 3 times. I've lost 18lbs in the past 5 days. I feel like this can't be right. Is this normal I know most is water weight but how much water does a person have floating around in their body?!?!?  I'm very new to this and this just seems wrong."
keto,Not feeling full no matter how much I eat!,"I dont know what's going on, but I have been keto off and on for years. January I started back and happy to say that I have dropped 19lbs since. I am 5'2"" female, 36, and am down to 208 from 227. 

However, my cycle is due any day now and I find myself snacking and eating A LOT. But I am not getting full. I literally just finished probably a 32 ounce bowl of keto Stew5-10 minutes ago, and am now drinking a huge avocado Berry shake, probably 24-30oz. A few hours ago, 4 buffalo chicken wings. Does anyone know if this has something to do with hunger hormones, adaptation, or can we just chalk it up to time of the month?"

keto,Accidentally ate too many carbs,"Hey, i accidentally ate too many carbs. I know it sounds stupid but I didn’t even think twice about my chicken being breaded. I checked the carbs in the tomato sauce and they were fine but I forgot about the breading.  Maybe I ate about 30g? Any tips? I don’t feel any different. Maybe I have a little more energy, but I just drank some coffee so idk lol.  I started to get a little bit of a headache after and that’s what made me think.  It’s not the end of the world, I think I’ll just count a little more strictly the next day or two."
keto,Conceiving on keto?,"Hi everyone! 

Long time lurker, found sooo many answers by reading posts here! I’ve on keto since last August, lost a little over 50 lbs (I’m not sure of my starting weight though), went from a tight xxl to a well fitting large. I’m now 183, 5’7’’ and I’m aiming for 150-155 and getting out of the overweight zone. Best part is I got rid of diabetes!!!! 

Now I have a question I couldn’t find an answer for here. My husband and I are thinking of trying for our last baby soon. But someone on a ttc forum told me conceiving on keto is dangerous. I know it is not good during pregnancy so I was planning on going back to low carb once I get a positive. But she insisted that it is dangerous at the time of conception. She couldn’t give me a clear answer on why, she just stated that not many studies were done, and we don’t know how long the effects of keto lasts. So this is all a little confusing to me, and disappointing. I already have to deal with irregular cycles and a husband who works away on a 14/14 schedule so the timing is already an issue. I don’t want to wait too long, I’m 35 and while I know many women conceive later, all my mothers side off the family went into menopause at 38, and it is likely that the same will happen to me. 

Does anybody here know the actual answer as to why it is dangerous for sperm to meet egg and grow into an embryo on keto, even before said embryo is even exchanging blood with the mother? Women here conceived on keto? What was the outcome? 

And here’s a little less important question; I cheated last Saturday on my birthday. I had pizza, fries, and cake. I avoided weighing myself for 2 days after. But today I’m still 3 lbs heavier than before I cheated. I know most of it is water weight, but would it take that long to go away? This can’t be 3 lbs of fat right???

Thank youuu!"
keto,Net carbs on korean labels?,"So, I got those konjac jelly snacks from H-Mart, and they're korean. I don't speak korean, but there's an English label on it.

[This product](https://fresh.hmart.com/880955703022)

The thing is, in the original packaging, it says 8g carbs, 1g fiber, 6g sugar alcohol (erythritol). But I'm wondering, I heard that in every country other than the US, sugar alcohols aren't counted as total carbs.

So is the 8g carbs the net carbs? Or can I subtract the 6g of Erythritol?"

And lowers free test due to increase in sbhg


So I feel bad high carb and a little irritated fasted

My question is should I continue keto and see my doctor or get off of it and then get tested.

Does anyone have experience with this? Please let me know ."
keto,Is it possible to keto forever?,"I started Keto six months ago to lose a bit of weight, but after about 2 months (after the flu which was pretty bad for me), I started reaping the benefits of this wonderful system.

keto,Need help with family (ie preschoolers &amp; husband) meals that I can easily sub parts of with Keto for me,"Hi everyone. I need some help. 

I have done keto on a off for a few years. The longest I ever stuck to it was for about 3 months, and I lost 30 pounds, which I quickly gained back (+ more, thanks pandemic stress) when I stopped. The problem I mostly ran into was dinners. I have preschooler twins, and a husband, and keto meals aren't really their thing. 

Now I'm in a panic, because my latest blood work shows I'm pre-diabetic. I also have insulin resistance/PCOS, but I've known about that. So now I really have to get into it, and stick with it. I'm drawing blanks and what kind of meals I can make that while not keto, I can easily swap part of the meal with a keto option for just myself. These swaps have to be EASY. I work full time, and have daycare drop off and pick up each day. 

I need ideas from people who have successfully managed to do keto, while their families not so much, and didn't kill themselves in the kitchen achieving it. 

So, throw all your best family friendly keto dinners my way.

Thank you in advance!"
keto,PSA: Make keto jerky!,"I was looking for a homemade beef jerky recipe, as the store bought is so expensive and or full of sugar. I debated many recipes, trying to calculate carbs absorbed for the marinade etc. but finally just tried salt and pepper. It’s excellent! I also tried marinating in a beef broth(in the instant pot) I made from the trimmed fat bits, that was great too, although more work. 

I got the dehydrator at the thrift store, but new it’s like $40, and the beef I get on sale at $2.50-$3lb. London broil slices the easiest, it’s a top/bottom round I think. I cut off all the fat and slice against the grain. I like my jerky dry and chewy, so I get about 1.25lbs jerky per 3lbs raw meat. This makes it less than $9lb!

TLDR: make homemade jerky! It can be literally just three ingredients, zero carb and is a super tasty/filling snack. Don’t overthink it.

 I have experienced with Keto and IF before and I have had great results, but this time around, being as busy as I am with work and having such little free time, I tend to prep a meal a day at around 700 to 900 calories, which i plan to have around 4PM, hoping to get another meal in worth roughly the same amount of calories when I'm back home by 8PM, but i always feel satisfied with my first meal at 900 calories-ish.

While this is great and all, I do not wish to loose weight too quickly to maintain my muscle mass and i would hate to have loose skin, this is extremely important for me, I do not care how long it takes for me to lose my weight but I do not to have loose skin, at least not sagging loose skin.

**TLDR: i eat 900 calories a day basically doing OMAD and I feel satisfied for the next 24 hours, I'm afraid of losing weight too fast and losing muscle mass and having loose skin.**

keto,"Can your blood tests be ""normal"" but still have low electrolyes on keto?","I've recently developed keto flu symptoms (dizziness, fatigueness etc) so I decided to have a blood test. Surprisingly all of them came back normal.

I do believe its low electrolyes as ketoade tastes heavenly despite being high in salt so I'm gonna consume that throughout the day. It does make me feel better temporarily but then I go back to feeling bad (probably just need more) I get a huge urge to just chug it but I heard it's bad, or can I?"
keto,Diet Nutrition,"Being overweight or obese is linked to many types of health problems including:

Type 2 diabetes

High blood pressure

Heart disease and strokes

Certain types of cancer

Sleep apnea

Osteoarthritis

Fatty liver disease

Kidney disease    

Besides these health problems being overweight or obese is also linked to emotional and mental problems such as depression and anxiety, and in general, it is more likely to have low self-esteem.

If you have tried every fad diet but you can’t lose weight you are not alone as 45 million Americans go on a diet each year, and spend $33 billion on weight loss products.

The truth is that the majority of these weight loss supplements don’t work and some of them can be dangerous to your health.

The good news is that there is a way to lose weight and have a toned body without diets, workouts, weight loss supplements, or gadgets. Yes, it is possible to lose weight fast while maintaining a healthy body and mind.

Poor diet

Lack of exercise

Stress

Genetics

Poor sleep

Smoking

The amazing thing about this tonic is that it comes from an island where people don’t suffer from obesity and where men and women have the longest life expectancy in the world."
keto,How to defeat the dreaded plateau?,"I am so sick of seeing 155-157lbs on the scale! I thought I had gotten past my January-February plateau of 158. mid-February I even got to 152. However, since then I'm back to 155-157 and not budging.

 I used the keto calculator to figure out my macros, have a decent caloric deficit, exercise regularly, hydrate well, watch my electrolytes, and I'm always under 20g net carbs. I've tried cutting back a little more on fats to try to get past the plateau.

This is not my first time on keto, and I am far better educated than I was last time. Under the fat, I am actually in better shape than last time too. But for some reason I can't seem to lose the last 15-ish lbs that just seemed to melt off last time. The only difference is I was 1 year postpartum when I started last time, and this time I'm about 8 months postpartum. Is that enough to make a difference?

I am open to any advice or suggestions. I know I won't drop the last of the weight quickly, but even just a half of a lb in the right direction would be so helpful!"

I have tried other recipes with almond flour and psyllium husk etc, nothing compares to this. If you give these to someone who does not know any better, I bet they would not know that it was supposed to be a low carb version.

keto,almost 2 months keto progress,"So, tbh I'm scared af to post this. Like, really scared. But I'm losing some motivation and tried these pants I wore last year and they are so loose! I don't see much difference in my body but the pants are so different. These were my favourite pair last year.

keto,13 Blocks of Butter (6.5kgs) in 3 Weeks,"In 2016 I met the love of my life. My income also improved drastically and with it the ability to eat and drink just about whatever I wanted. Life was a celebration and we enjoyed many amazing meals and partied like it was 1984. And with the happiness came the kilograms. We got married February last year and by that time I had Shot up from 90kgs, which for 1.79m was already overweight, to 114Kgs. We have not processed our wedding photos. 

As the weight piled tasks I could normally do with ease became really difficult. I love DIY but having to bend down to look for tools in my toolbox became a huge effort. Everything was an effort. 

I was well aware of the effect the weight gain was having on me, but I knew in order for me to be successful in losing the weight I would need to stop drinking, not something I really wanted to do. 

Even though I would wake up early hours of the morning guilt ridden about what I was doing to myself, I thought to myself, what does a person do if you quit drinking... it seemed really boring. 

We tried to compromise by cutting down on the booze and ate healthier but still nothing was happening and the weight kept increasing. Every day's bottle and some's wine, and whatever else, would leave us waking up lethargic and I would need that extra meal to help myself recover from my hangover, just about every day (won't even mention weekends and holidays).

To get real with myself I would equate my weight with blocks of butter. After struggling to get out of a swimming hole because I could not lift myself up, I took my stepson to the shopping center and packed 60 500g blocks of butter into a block to show him how much I need to lose. The following year or two I picked up another few kgs since then until I reached 119kgs. It's funny concept but the picture kept stuck in my head. Imagine walking around with a few shopping bags worth of butter every day, then  going to bed with that butter. And now stack those cubes of butter all over yourself like a suicide vest and imagine what it looks like. Its uncomfortable, unhealthy and not good. 

A new talent I acquired was to be able to rest a beer on my stomach hands free... it was time for change. It was not worth the everyday backache and foot pain and a general lack of zest for life. Aside from that there was hardly any clothes that fitted when going shopping... a big indictment on retail.

3 weeks ago, after many failed attempts, we finally took the plunge. No booze, 16:8 Intermittent fasting, and a Keto diet. I know they say to ease in, but I knew if we did not see results we would lose interest. 

The results have been astounding and many of the fears I had turned out to be completely unfounded lies we told ourselves that kept us trapped in our apathy. Once we got going it turned out to be much easier than I had anticipated. 

My energy was up, I sleep like that tree that fell in the forest, and I have suddenly found the will to do all the things I had been putting off for so long. 

My skin cleared up, my organs are no longer paining anymore (also no more dread of what conditions I may be getting as a result of my excessive lifestyle),  and I have just an enormous sense of well being. I have lost 6.5kgs, my wife 4kgs, and I no longer am bulging out of clothes that are too small for me. We are also saving ALOT.

I must add, we are not calorie counting for now, but the combination of the 3 is really working well for us. We eat enough but we don't pig out. An Omelette at lunch and a solid meal at night with a meaty snack in between if we need it. If we stall at some point down the road we will become more clinical. 

I know it has only been 3 weeks, but looking back I now realise how we had been slowly poisoning ourselves. 

Our low carb diet has been amazing and has really helped curb my insatiable hunger pangs, but I would never have been able to keep this up if I did not make a break with alcohol. Perhaps others can do it, but for us it would never have worked. We planned to do this until middle may but I am concerned that should we go back and celebrate, the gains we fought so hard for will be lost on a wayward path of small compromises. 

For now, for both my wife and I, the celebration is living a fuller life with more energy, focus and purpose; and I am determined to persevere and finally maintain. If there are so many of you who could do it and stick it out then I know we can as well."
keto,Ketogenic diet for epilepsy,So I've had epilepsy for about 2 years and i couldn't find a medication that wouldn't have brutal side effects. I tried the ketogenic diet and i could take half the dose i ussaly take and not get any seizures. I had a carb accident and im scared that i might get seizures. Is it being in ketosis that helps with the epilepsy? I've been on keto for about 3 months btw.
keto,Lotus Root (???),I used to always drink Lotus Root tea by boiling the Lotus Root in water and drink it. I cant find any information on weather its okay on Keto or how many carbs is on it. All the information is on eating the whole lotus root itself which is very high in carbs.
keto,Keto and irritability and low energy,Hello guys. First of all I m not doing keto cause I want to lose weight. I m doing keto cause I have depression for 12 years and I was being medicated since there and I was eating on those 12 years almost 300 carbs. And I have an idea that my depression was caused because I was consuming to many carbs. So 15 days ago I stopped all carbs. I only take 20 grams.and the first week it was hard. I had some cravings. But now I don't have it anymore. But i feel equally depressed like I was before keto. I dont feel any diference. I m taking a lot of fat and protein. I m drinking salted water and I m taking multivitamin but yet I feel exactly equal when I was eating carbs. Not more not less depressed. Some advice?
keto,Switching proteins,"So I stalled out at 204lbs about 2 weeks ago, not really thinking I just decided to load up on salmon to change it up from ground beef and chicken. I dropped down to 193 which took me completely by surprise. Well yesterday I decided to have chicken and eggs for m OMAD meal and to my surprise when I woke up I feel bloated with like 1lb of weight gain. Im wondering if maybe its best to switch over to an all fish diet to finish these last 25lbs. I usually eat avocados mashed too, asparagus and I use slap ya mama seasoning which could be another reason im bloating cause of all the salt. Im kind of just wondering if this is a random weight loss or if fish is really helping me this much."

keto,Lost 22 lbs in 7 weeks!,"Hi folks,

I have just got back from working offshore for 7 weeks on an Italian vessel, after the first 3 days straight of pasta/bread/rice I felt awful and vowed to not have another bite of these foods. I decided to start keto on 16:8 and asked the cook for meat and fish (all they had were lean cuts). Unfortunately because I started whilst I was away for work, I didn't have scales to track food or bodyweight and I didn't have any electrolytes to supplement, which meant keto flu struck hard and fast. There was also no onboard gym to exercise so I did what I could in my cabin, a few bodyweight exercises.

Anyway, I struggled through and I'm finally back home, I jumped on the scale and discovered I had lost 22lbs since leaving, having been surrounded by refined carbohydrates the whole time! I am also now loaded up on electrolytes and feel invincible, time to start tracking my food obsessively and smashing the weights to shed the remaining 21lbs!

Keep going folks, with a bit of discipline and perseverance you can and will achieve great results!

Shout out to the keto family on Reddit, I lurked a lot whilst I was away, reading the experiences of others every morning is what kept me on track. 

I'll be back when I hit my goal!"

I have a question about bulking. I want to get some muscles in my upper body predominantly as I already have muscles on my legs. My initial plan was to basically start with a blank canvas by dropping as much fat as I can and then building muscle from there. Now I’m wondering if I need some fat to bulk up too? Should I start a gym program now or wait until I’m closer to my goal? Should I be posting this in r/ketogains ?

It is so tasty, not overly sweet, and brings all the flavor (&amp; multiple flavors at that). Solid 5/7, highly recommend.

Also, if for some reason you have been craving marshmallows, try these. The cinnamon toast is the best imo. Only 5 carbs for 2 of them.

I have a low sodium salt that I use, but would literally have to douse my food with it to meet the amount of K I should be getting. And it ruins the food, so I don't want to eat it. 

What tricks do you guys use to make sure you get enough? I don't want to take another supplement. I have tried dissolving the low sodium salt in water and drinking it, but it's foul. I can't do it!"
keto,Introducing carbs on strength day,"Short version: Thoughts on 1 day with moderate carbs, 2 days no carbs, repeat. Carbs on strength day, no carbs on rest and cardio days.   


Long Version:  
I have yet to read a whole lot on carb cycling, I've seen the term but am just starting research. That's why I'm here, to learn more about it! But I'm considering switching to something closer to ""carb cycling"" since I'm really having a rough time adapting this time around; huge loss in strength, zero energy, aches, just overall drop in performance. I know this is par for the course, I did keto about 2 years ago for something like 9-10 months. It was good, I enjoyed it, felt good over all, performance at the time was really good. The difference is that at the time I was doing very little ""strength training."" Lots of hypertrophy style, HIIT, etc. but no really heavy lifting. I had also lost like 60-70 pounds so no shit I felt better!   


Since coming off keto (and regaining my ""fat fuck"" status) I've got into strongman and just ""strength training"" in general. Saw some great gains and was doing really well. Fast forward to now, I'm back to keto, it's been about 3 weeks and everything is in the shitter. I knew there was strength loss but this is a bit too much for me. I can fight through the fatigue (2 kids I'm used to it) but when I'm dragging my ass to my workout only to see a drop every time it's just disheartening.   


So what are your thoughts on introducing carbs on strength days? I'm thinking oats for breakfast, whey for lunch, sweet potatoes or similar with supper. Leave everything else the same. Then back to IF and no carbs the following 2 days (one conditioning, one rest).  Am I just going to forever feel like a sack of shit as I'll never really be in ketosis but also always be starved for carbs? Should I just pick one or the other or is it feasible to do something like this?"
keto,Effects of Triphala Churna on keto,"Hi, I started keto a few days ago and am feeling a little constipated even after drinking 6-7L of water everyday (I weigh 130kg).

Haritaki, Bibhitaka, and Amalaki (gooseberry).

Does anyone here have any experience of using Triphala Churna to help with digestion?

Any help is appreciated. Thank you."
keto,"To fast or not to fast, that is the question?","So, I have been on my keto journey off and on for 4 years. When I first started I never fasted and lost a lot of weight. I’ve added fasting to my lifestyle for the last 3 years. Is it just me but I feel I lost more weight not fasting then to fast.... what is your experience on Keto."
keto,What is your personal experience with exercise and weight loss?,"I’ve been doing research on this and am finding different answers all over the place. Some say that exercise accelerates weight loss. Others say it drastically stalls weight loss. Personally, I love working out 3-5 times a week, nothing crazy, just some light weights and cardio. However, my goal is to drop pounds and get to a healthy weight. So I wanted to put this question out there - what is your personal experience with exercise and weight loss (with keto, obv)? 

Thanks for reading!"
keto,I need some motivation !,"I was doing so good for two years doing keto.

Someone motivate me. I need some easy recipes that maybe I could incorporate!"
keto,How low is too low? (Deficit),"Hey Everyone,

So I've done keto off and on for almost 6 years, not a beginner to say the least. I love experimenting with it and seeing how far I can tweak it to fit my goals. Here's the situation, I'm literally stuck at around 900-1000 calories a day. Diet looks like this, Breakfast: 3 eggs with spinach and a protein shake, 450 calories. Lunch: (Post workout) Broccoli and a chicken breast, 300calories. Dinner: Protein shake, 200 calories. I'm hitting my protein macros, but keeping fat relatively low except for eggs and whatever fat I cook with. Haven't had any adverse affects, full of energy and hunger doesn't come to mind even with fats low. 

My main concern is the deficit, I literally do not feel hungry. Has anyone tried this or something similar? SO far it seems sustainable. Even with a huge deficit. 

Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated. Cheers."
keto,Keto OUT OF CONTROL!,"Keto 8 weeks today. F/32 Start:193lbs current:178lbs 

I just. I don't know if I can go on. Every week it's something. My electrolytes get out of whack and I get headaches, or muscle cramps, or such intense fatigue my eyes feel like they have sunken straight back into my skull. Working out feels like an impossibility. 

I am taking 800mg of magnesium, 1/2tsp salt in my morning coffee (plus tsp of MCT), 550-1100mg potassium, and a daily vitamin supplement. I drink water when I am thirsty but also a minimum of 3cups of tea a day. I religiously logged all my macros (20g carbs/\~110g fat/\~90g protein/1300cals) for the first 6 weeks but have since scaled back. I added tree nuts, upped my avocado count, and added leafy greens for lunch. 

I still feel like I am carrying around a bunch of water weight (scale varies 2-4lbs every couple days). My hormones are completely messed up. 

Does anyone have any words of encouragement? I want so badly to reach my goal via keto but my body just is not on board. Anyone have a bad start-good ending story to share?"
keto,Sitting on my ass during low carb transition?,"So I have 6 weeks of time off between my old job and new job. I say this as a very lucky person: I have the option to sit on my ass during the low carb transition. is there any downside to ""taking it easy"" while I am going through high carb withdrawal? Should I force myself to do moderate exercise like hiking? Let me know what you think!"
keto,Should I track my carb intake?,I don’t follow the keto diet but I’ve been dieting for a few months now and have only limited my calorie intake. I don’t really track my carb intake and have been eating unhealthy foods as long as it was under my calorie goal for the day. I was wondering if my weight loss would be more effective if I limited my carb intake.
keto,How to hit macros when allergic to avocado,"Hi all! I’ve been keto for the past week. It was a bit of a rocky adjustment, I REALLY felt the carbs withdrawal the first 6 days or so. I feel like I’m hitting my stride and feel a lot better, however I’m struggling to hit the macros. 

I’m hitting between 65 and 70 % fat between 20 and 30% protein and between 7-9% carbs (around 30 net a day). My fat has largely been from heavy cream, oil and cheese. It seems like every recipe and every keto site uses avocado as a fat filler. I’m allergic and feel like that limits a lot of what I eat. I’m not very well versed in fats but I feel like fat in an avocado is much better than fat I’m getting from cheese and I want to make sure I’m not inadvertently shooting myself in the foot."
keto,How to stop/deal with carb cravings ?,"So I started keto on the third. I realized today i had been accidentally eating at a 400 cal deficit

I was feeling pretty depressed earlier.


So today I tried to eat at just below Maintenence calories.

I’ve been waking up early and hitting the gym, taking cold showers, journaling and meditating. 


Thing have been going pretty swell except for in starting to get carb cravings . I’m drinking my electrolytes and taking magnesium at night.


How do I deal with this? Should I be eAting at exactly maintence?

keto,The Mayo Clinic discussion of the ketogenic diet,"[https://youtu.be/VUExZ9FNUCk](https://youtu.be/VUExZ9FNUCk)

The misinformation they spewed in this video is just appalling. This video is only 2 years old, so they don't have the excuse of not having studied this diet. But, they still initially act like it's some kind of fringe diet they don't understand and have barely heard of. But later on, they even mention that people they know, including patients, have successfully used the diet to lose large amounts of weight.

The bulk of their criticism of the ketogenic diet seems to stem from their conflation of ketosis with ketoacidosis. After hearing this garbage, I can't believe these people have medical degrees.

In case you don't want to watch the video, here are some lowlights in their discussion of keto before they start pimping the Mediterranean and DASH diets:

* 0:30 - ""Ketosis -- What can go wrong? (laughter) Sounds a little dangerous.""
* 3:46 - ""When I think about ketosis, sometimes I get a little nervous. I think, gosh, we don't really want you in ketosis.""
* 4:06 - ""Really, when you think about what ketosis is, it's an alternative pathway that our body has to use in times of emergency and times when your brain needs energy and, for some reason, there's not food, particularly carbohydrates, because that's the fuel your brain prefers.""
* 4:44 - ""It's something that historically has alarmed us in terms of...we don't necessarily want people in ketosis. It can be very dangerous. Ketone bodies are considered toxic. Your body has two ways of getting rid of them. You either exhale them through your breath or you urinate them out, and so it's a stressful kind of process on your body too because your body is trying to rid itself of these ketone bodies.""
* 5:25 - ""For them (people who've lost weight on keto), they consider that to be, finger quotes, successful, but possibly we're talking two different languages here. Ketosis and those ketones and things--that's some place you want to be health-wise."""
keto,Kidney question,"Has anyone who has kidney problems had trouble doing keto? I had kidney surgery years ago and have no issues at all.
However, my neighbor who sees a nephrologist is worried all the protein is going to affect his creatinine and protein levels. My doctor is very happy with my keto lifestyle. He wants to speak to his dr. I told him to be prepared because most drs don’t know the first thing about keto."

Well it's been 11 frustrating days for me. Was just going back and forth between 318-320.. Felt like my progress slowed/ stalled. I decided the begginning of this past week to increase my deficit and restrict my cals down to 1600. Also keeping my lunch and dinner to in between 11am - 4pm daily. Seems to be working now :)"
keto,6 week stall - talked to my doctor (Ob/Gyn),"Ok, so I started Keto January 1, 2021. Had a good two first weeks.  Then I started taking progesterone only pills. Skip the next paragraph to skip medical stuff. I am currently in a 6 week stall. I have only had one cheat day (with sushi for dinner).  

I was diagnosed with adenomyosis in December 2020 .  Fancy name for endometriosis in the uterus, instead of outside of it.  It hurts.  Painful periods.  Very heavy.  I had an ablation back two years ago and it failed - because of the adenomyosis. Only fix for this is a hysterectomy.  I feel the need to time this out - put it off for a bit.  I don't want to contract covid while doing a surgery that is not 100% necessary.  So, in the meantime, she prescribed progesterone, to help decreased the buildup of the lining of the endometrium. I had previously (decades ago) used Depoprevera and gained 30 pounds in a month.

So, I have many unwanted side effects from this progesterone.  Heavier periods, more cramping, joint aches, fatigue, and we believe weight ""gain"".  She and I discussed my weight loss journey, looked over my food logs. And we agreed to stop the pill, because losing weight can be more beneficial to this process. And with my calorie deficit, I certainly should have been losing weight.

So, here I am hopeful I can bust up this stall.  Stopped taking the progesterone yesterday.  Supposedly it will take 3-7 days for it to leave my system. I want to see that scale  MOVE.  It is bruising to the ego to eat keto and not lose one single ounce in 6 weeks."
keto,"Thoughts on keto shortness of breath? Not electrolytes, less O2 to cells?","Hi, I’ve been doing keto on and off for about 3 months now and I’ve noticed shortness of breath when I’m in ketosis. I’ve seen four doctors about this, gotten an EKG, lung inflammation test and allergy tests—all negative! I’m 23. 

The thing is, the shortness of breath goes away when I’m out of ketosis. It’s not anxiety shortness of breath, it’s like not getting enough air to the bottom of my lungs. 

I posted about this once before and I was told it’s electrolytes/go see a doctor. 

I’m absolutely compulsive about electrolytes: I have magnesium, potassium and sodium every day in the FAQ-recommended amounts. Still get shortness of breath. I thought maybe I was randomly having quarter-life massive anxiety out of the blue..(?) until seeing a post in a forum that explains EXACTLY what I’m experiencing, with other similar accounts: 

https://www.ketogenicforums.com/t/can-keto-cause-shortness-of-breath/102936

I’m really relieved I’m not the only one! My question is, does anyone else experience this? Does anyone have any ideas as to what this could be?

I’m doing keto for insulin resistance/health purposes and am wondering if I should be low carb if I get shortness of breath sub 20-30 net carbs."
keto,How many eggs a day are safe on Keto?,"Hi, fellow Keto People. I have been doing a combination of Keto and Atkins and I have been eating 3 eggs a day. I am always looking for ways to get as much protein as possible. It’s the only thing that fills me up and then I don’t crave carbs and sweets. Also, does anyone have a recipe for a high protein shake without Whey?
Thanks Redditor’s🤗"
keto,Question about Keto and fat loss,"I understand in comparison to regular diets keto means the body burns fat for energy. So my question is, does this mean the body burns the existing fat on the body or does it burn the fat that we eat first then the former? If it is the former, then great? but if its the later then how is this diet more beneficial then a traditional carb deficit diet?"
keto,Break up food recipe ideas needed :(,"Hey friends,

So i'm reaching out for some support tonight and I'm about to get reallll personal... Long story short I have to break up with an awesome guy I've been dating for a year tomorrow.

Any and all suggestions welcome and appreciated."
keto,Keto while ramping up exercise intensity?,"Hi all,

This is my second time doing keto. First was during a 12-day retreat (9 days of keto, 3 days fasting). Now I am about month in with a ""cheat weekend"" that I regret. (I felt much worse in my body and didn't enjoy the cheating as much as I thought I would.) I weigh about 75kg, down about 3kg a month ago. I spiked to nearly my pre-keto weight on the Monday after the cheat weekend and by Friday I am only 1kg off. I am guessing that I lost about 1.8kg of water weight and about 200g of fat and/or possibly muscle (a guess based on CICO).

Several years ago I was able to complete a week-long cycling trip with hilly terrain. I started out able to ride 15 miles the first day (and hating it) to being able to ride 45 miles or so on the last day. That was probably my best cardiovascular fitness. I am now riding 5 times a week on an indoor trainer using /r/Zwift. I am ramping up my exercise intensity gradually. Now I am doing about an hour to an hour and a half on the bike 5x a week, mostly in zone 4 heart rates. My goal is to check off Zwift's hardest route—173km and 2496m—in 3 months. I'll be patient with myself and listen to my body.

I am currently targeting a 500-calorie/day deficit so I can lose what I think is a conservative 1 lb/week. I would also like to improve my cardiovascular fitness. I am limiting carbohydrates from 20–25g daily and intermittent fast for 16–18 hours daily. I have a tendency to go over with the protein and under with the fat, so I plan to learn how to eat less meat and switch to higher fat/protein ratio foods such as high-fat dairy, 100% MCT oil, seeds, etc. I live in a place that has very good quality meat, fish, and dairy.

As I ramp my exercise from about 2 hours a day 5 days a week to possibly more than double that as I pursue this challenge (the later rides will entail upwards of 6 hours at relatively high intensity), I'm beginning to wonder if the standard macro formula will work. I am currently using my average Active Energy and Resting Energy stats to adjust total caloric intake and my macro calculations (using [keto.app](https://keto.app)'s formula but with a lower carb goal).

What should I know as I increase my activity levels while also adopting a ketogenic diet?"
keto,Zero carb drinks on Keto?,"Howdy, sorry to bother you guys with such a simple question but here it goes. I'm curious if drinking stevia drinks or sucralose drinks all day stop you from losing fat. i have been told numerous times about it raising insulin which causes you to store fat I guess but I'm curious what your guys experience is with it. thanks."
keto,What's stopping me from having as many carbs as I want if all I have to do is maintain a ratio?,"I've been researching keto as thoroughly as I can, trying to get all the information so I can do it right, but a lot of things aren't at all clear.  


I keep encountering different percentages all over the place - some sources say 5% carbs, others 10, some say 60% fat, others 85 - but the one thing that really confuses me is that these are all ratios, not amounts. Does that not mean that, in theory, I can eat as many carbs as I want, as long as I make sure to have 4 - 5 times more protein and 12 - 19 times more fat (depending on which macro nutrient percentages you subscribe to) and maintain the same ratios? Why would I restrict carbs to 20 grams if 20 grams isn't necessarily 5% of my caloric intake?  


Sorry if this is a stupid question, I just can't find anything anywhere that answers this."
keto,I lost 15 pounds!!!,"I started keto on January 4th, 2021. 24f, about 5’3, and my starting weight was 170. During quarantine, i got depressed, and when I stepped on the scale in December I was so disheartened. I am SO glad that I channeled that negativity into bettering myself. 

I fell off the wagon for a week. I live in Texas and when the winter storm hit, I was at my partner’s. We got hit pretty hard and so we could not go anywhere. We had to eat what we had (which was mostly pasta and rice based dishes) Prior to this, I had lost ten pounds. I felt like I had probably gained back everything I already lost, and decided not to weigh myself for a couple of weeks and just get back on keto. 

Today, I had a really hard day at work, and almost had a cheat meal. Literally drove to the drive thru, waited in line, felt too much pre-guilt and drove off. Then tonight I was thinking “would it even matter, I feel like I haven’t lost anything.” I couldn’t help it and weighed myself (I shouldn’t weight at night, I know) I was fully prepared to step on the scale and realize I was back where I started. I couldn’t believe it when I saw 155! I literally started dancing and singing We like to Party by Vengaboys lmfao.

I know it’s not the most dramatic of success stories, but it has really made me want to keep going and I’m so happy I didn’t cheat today. Anyways, I really wanted to tell someone :)

Edit: THANK YOU ALL FOR THE SUPPORT &lt;3 omg I just woke up and I am crying. Y’all truly are such a lovely, supportive, community and I don’t think I would’ve made it this far without reading your stories. So I’m glad I finally have one to share too. Going to work now, I will try to respond to more people when I get off :) much love"
keto,"Do you think your body ""remembers"" past Keto diets?","Some context: I've done some form of low carb at least 6 times over the past 10 years- the longest time was about 3 months. The weight always comes back on plus some... familiar story anyone lol... Anyways, now I'm in my mid-30s and I've been doing plain CICO because it just seems easier for me to stick to long term. For the last 2 months I've hit a plateau so I decided to try and get over the hump by restarting Keto since I've had success in the past. This time around I'm also diligently tracking my calories and macros. It's been a week and I've only lost 1lb...seems strange to me because I always remember loosing 3-4lbs in my first week and then another 3-4 my second week before it slowed down. 

I know it hasn't been long, but any thoughts on why it doesn't seem to be working as well this time around, especially given that I am counting calories/macros? I guess I could just be getting old... thanks in advance for the advice!"
keto,Kirkland Protein bars changed their nutritional info :/,I just bought 2 boxes of them only to find that they changed their nutritional panel to 4 net carbs a bar to 10 grams :( they're so good so I'm sad to see them not be as keto friendly as I thought. I'm still gonna enjoy half of one as like a dessert for the time being just so I don't waste them but sigh disappointing but what can you do 😅 this mightve been posted her already but thought I'd bring it up to y'all haha
keto,I’ve lost 20 lbs in two weeks using Keto &amp; IF.,"I’ve posted before but I guess this is more like a formal introduction. Prior to covid, I’d been working out like a maniac and hit all my personal bests. I got up to 205 lbs as my high and I was pretty muscular, especially for that weight and only being 5’8”. Long story short, I haven’t been able to hit the gym and while I hadn’t gained weight, I watched my body get squishy.

Flash forward to 2 Fridays ago and I decided to start Keto on a whim. I’d already been doing IF during the week and that helped me not gain weight but I wasn’t losing any. So I combined IF with Keto and within two weeks I’ve lost 20 lbs. Last time I did Keto it took about 4 weeks to lose this weight. This time around has been much easier than the last.

Ultimately I’m already halfway to my weight goal. I’d love to get down to 165 then come back up to 175 but with muscular growth, not fat. 

This diet has worked wonders for me. Kicking energy drinks was easy and having the two cheat days on the weekend kills my sugar cravings during the week. Honestly I can’t wait to eat keto foods by Sunday night lol.

I can’t wait to finally get back to a comfortable weight and begin loving myself in the mirror again. I wish you all the best!"
keto,Best Keto Desserts?,"I am a sugar addict. Chocolate especially is my vice. I went on keto over the summer and had a lot of success, but just found a hard time finding deserts that don’t have an odd taste/texture. I’m off full keto and just trying to work in keto meals here and there and maintaining my weight well, but would like to lose a few more pounds. Desserts are one of my main issues, so I just wanted to ask if anyone had any suggestions for desserts that taste as close as possible to the real thing? Recipes or store bought items welcome! Also what are your favorite sweeteners? I use Swerve right now and the cooling aftertaste really bothers me."

keto,How do you fix the lack of appetite that comes along with the keto diet?,"I have been on keto for three months and lost 22 lbs (4 of which were this week only). I've noticed that I can go for hours and days without thinking about food. Whenever I do force myself to eat, I feel full after three spoonfuls. I went a full 48 hours on only 400 calories about three days ago, and only ate 300 calories for dinner today. Even the thought of going in the kitchen made me feel ill. My energy levels are okay- I work 12 hour days, a very physical job and I haven't struggled too much. I even ate a piece of chocolate with my dinner thinking that if my blood sugar goes up, my appetite will return, but nope. I am getting seriously concerned about this because I am almost underweight and I do not want to ruin my health. I am 119 lbs now."

keto,Bone broth question," Hi,

So I am very keen to incorporate bone broth to my routine as it has so many wonderful minerals. I tried beef bones and chicken feet and both put me off, I don't know...it was just too intense for me. I barely eat chicken and fish in my diet, I don't like beef and pork maybe that's why. 

We do eat chicken wings quite often so I was wondering if I should use the wings instead.
The questions are will the wings produce as much quality as the chicken feet would? Also after baking them in the oven for quite a bit, would it still yield good quality broth? 

Lastly, sometimes I buy my meat in the supermarket (UK), I know the quality of meat is not as great as butchers/ farm meat but will the bones drop their quality significantly as well?"
keto,Five months on Keto,"Hi everyone! I’ve been lurking this sub since I officially started keto and have loved seeing everyone’s hard work paying off. 

I’ve always had an active lifestyle but my diet was undisciplined until September 2020. I come from a Hispanic and Italian background, and if you know anything about those two cultures when it comes to food you know that it is basically anti-keto when it comes to carbs and sugar. Last year was particularly challenging - a bad break up and two sudden deaths in my family topped with financial instability. I tell you this because I tend to be an emotional eater, so that was a huge factor of my overindulgent/careless behavior last year. I turned to comfort foods to make myself feel better and it was starting to get out of control. 

I finally had enough.

I never even thought twice about changing my diet until a good friend of mine suggested I try keto. I decided to commit and I’ve honestly never felt better...

My family is supportive and have all noticed a big shift in my mood, confidence and overall appearance. It took me longer to notice my own physical progress but I knew this lifestyle change was actually making me feel good from the inside out so I just kept up with it. 

I wish I had a before picture but didn’t think it would  matter at the time...if you haven’t done so already, take progress pics now! You’ll be blown away. KCKO

keto,They just added great value jalapeño flavored pork rinds at Walmart.,"Yo, for about $2 for a fairly large bag, these are pretty poppin.

keto,Huge calorie deficit but can’t make myself eat any more. What do I do?,"About me; 32m, 6’5”, SW: 503 CW: 484 GW: 280 Lean Body: 270 - On keto for a 1.5 weeks this time

I was on keto with 2-3 fasting days a week for 6 months 2 years ago and lost 170lbs but gained much of it back after a bad living situation and worse choices.  I’ve been back on since Tuesday of last week, cut out all added sugar, no more diet Dr Pepper, I only drink water and the occasional Bang. Here’s my issue, my TDEE is estimated at 4475 calories (which I know is not 100%) and from the damnripped calculator, a 50% daily calorie intake is 2237, which is way too high for me to eat. In fact between the appetite suppression from keto, and the appetite suppression from my ADHD meds, I’m averaging about 8-15 grams of carbs and my calorie tracker (I track everything and eat simply so it’s easier to track) averages about 1100-1300 calories per day. The problem is I’ve tried eating more and I’m just not hungry. I drink at least 1 full gallon of water per day and I think that helps keep me sated. Should I drink less? Any tips for getting more calories? Thanks!"
keto,I think I've made an eggless fat sauce that is better than Mayo or Hollandaise," 

I have some tolerance issues with  eggs. But I find mayo/hollandaise sauces make keto so much better and  easier to do. I'd swear the fats are easier to digest from those emulsion fat sauces. 

So I wanted to  figure out how to make an eggless sauce. I searched online, found some recipes. But from comments, and the few recipes I tried, they weren't like a real mayo/hollandaise/bernaise sauce. Wrong consistency, flavor wasn't right, mouthfeel not smooth/creamy but more gloppy/gel-like, how it 'rests' on food or reacts to being used as a dip wasn't right either.  Even the emulsification didn't seem to be right. I noticed with eggs the taste of olive oil remains, but the acidity/tingly is reduced and you get a 'smoothness'. But with the 'eggless' versions, the acidity/tingly remains. 

Eventually, just through making observations of cooking over  time, I figured something out. I'm not sure how to share the my 'discovery' though. 

The sauce I've  learned to make is creamier and richer than mayo and hollandaise, can be  emulsified with water to get the right consistency, works exceeding  well with a reduction for added flavor, does not require an acid allowing a wider range of flavor profile, does not have any raw products, has more depth of flavor than eggs provide (if you tried other  eggless recipes you know they can be bland by comparison, this one is  big on the background flavor)...  
I think what I've found really is superior. It's  also easier to make to some extent. There's no need for double boilers or complicated temperature control to prevent egg curdles, and the sauce doesn't 'break' as easily as hollandaise/mayo. 

One drawback is it requires  some more prep. But even that prep is not really a 'new or additional task'. Think of it more like the  difference between boiling a potato and just eating it as it, versus  boiling it and then mashing them down. It doesn't take much more effort  or time, you just have to plan things out differently.

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't find any mention of making sauces using this cooking technique on the internet. I find it hard to believe no one else knows about it, but that's what seems to be the case. So, I'm not sure if I should publish it myself on a  website, or sell it to someone with a 'keto food blog', but it seems like I might want to be careful and do more digging.

So part of figuring things out is seeking feedback from other people on a HFLC/ketogenic diet.  

What  I'd like to ask people here, is how interested are you be in an eggless fat sauce/mayo/hollandaise/bernaise sauce recipe that doesn't have any  more carbs than an egg-based sauce? Do you eat those types of sauces regularly?"
keto,Bocha Sweet sweetener... anyone tried it?,"I had tremendous success with keto years ago. Did it pretty religiously for about 2 years. Over time, a new job, commute, and grad school hours made be become a little lax and the weight started creeping on. 
As I’m trying the diet again, I’m realizing how much I hated one aspect of it... the sugar alcohols. Erythritol, stevia, and any combination sweetener with erythritol can go to hell! They wreck my stomach, making me a gassy bloated mess. I know some of you will preach that cutting out sugar will help adjusting tastebuds, but I really enjoy baked goods. Plus, it would be nice to not try to kid myself that baked goods using that nonsense even tastes good when I know I’ll be hurting within an hour after eating them. 

TLDR: I found out about Bocha Sweet. Has anyone tried it? If so, can you chime in on how it compares to erythritol or any swerve/lakanto kind of sweetener that includes erythritol? I specifically want to know if it causes stomach upset. And if you know of ANY sweetener that doesn’t cause stomach upset, please share! I’m willing to try if it’s worth a shot at baking again and not feeling like crap afterwards. Thanks!!"
keto,Thinking about switching my meal order. Thoughts?,"Currently I eat two meals per day:

- a brunch with eggs, sausage or bacon, and avocado
- a dinner with meat and veggies

The first meal isn't that heavy, but the second is kind of heavy compared to the first. 

My problem is that my job is variable and I don't eat dinner at the same time every night. Sometimes I eat at 7p and others I eat at 11p. Brunch is usually eaten at the same time every day (about 11a).

I weigh myself a lot and have noticed I often weigh less before dinner (after work) than before breakfast (before work), but then the next day my weight is back up in the morning. Is it because the heavier food hasn't processed enough during sleep?  I'm wondering if I should eat the heavier meal before work and then the lighter meal after? Would that give my body more time to process the heavier foods (during activity instead of sleep)? Or does it not matter since I'm still eating the same total stuff for the day? 

Thoughts?"
keto,Can I eat a high carb item if my intake for the day has been low?,"Hi there, I have had my lunch and only ate 8 grams of carbs, my dinner will bring me up to 20, an ice cream is 28g, this means I’ll have 48g, below the 50g I am aiming to eat per day.

keto,Calorie and fat intake,"I’m currently 43y/F at 270. I’m averaging around 2,000 calories a day with fat. Bullet proof coffee and chia pudding with coconut milk puts me at around 900 calories. Does that sound right? I’m doing intermittent fasting 18:6 and apple cider vinegar. How do you keep your calories at 1200 daily eating so much fat? Do you count calories?"
keto,An interesting pattern I've noticed with men and keto and alcohol.,"I'm an alcoholic (10 year+ sober now) and a keto-r. I run/chair men's closed AA meetings and have for several years. Over the past probably three years I have seen more and more men drastically cut back on drinking once following the keto diet.

Men who would put back 12+ beers a day switched to whiskey and maybe have 2 or 3 and are satiated. Not saying Keto is a cure for alcoholism, just that I have noticed many men who talk about their journey of getting sober, many discuss this WOE. Many also say they aren't ready to give up alcohol entirely, but their tolerance is so changed by keto they no longer binge drink.

Has anyone experienced this?

Happy Friday y'all!"
keto,"First timer- not quitting, just wonderinf if this is normal?","I have been a long, long time lurker.

I am 40/F, 5'4"" and have been on keto for two weeks as of yesterday, coming off a diet 90% fast food.

I do OMAD and have three meals I prep and rotate (one chicken, one seafood, one beef).

When I started I weight 151lbs and my use the Keto app, which calculated my macros at:

1189 calories
103 grams of fat
15 grams of carbs
51 grams of protein.

I made my OMAD meals within 5-10 grams of this, and always under with carbs and calories. I also walk 5K a day, and do NOT include that in my macros (ie: I don't eat more).

The first week, Wednesday to Wednesday, I weighed in and went from 151 to 142 (water weight, I know). But then, eating the exact same foods and exercising the same way the next week, when I weighed myself yeterday I was at 147 and I feel suuuper bloated and my clothes are fitting more snug.

I read up online and saw that bloating can happen as your body adjusts to the fibre, but that usually happens during the first week.

Otherwise, I feel incredible, but I'm just confused about the weight thing (it's also not shark week, I know that can change things.)

Thank you so much, Keto community."

I have had this dream for a long, long time, but have been so hesitant because it’s a nerdy tattoo. I don’t mind being a nerd with a nerd tattoo, but I never wanted to end up a fat nerd with a nerd tattoo, so I’ve never gotten around to it.

I’ve been doing keto for a few weeks now, have been feeling good, haven’t slipped once, and have been seeing real results! While I don’t want to reward myself *now*, since I know it’s WAY too early, I would like to at some point, and I would love for that to be my tattoo.

What would be a good point for that sort of reward? Have any of you tried something similar in the past? Would you do something like a reward at say 30 or 40 pounds? Or more like being vigilant for three or four solid months? Or are these sorts of rewards not that much of an incentive? OR! After getting some kind of reward, are you less likely to continue your journey?"
keto,Bacon,"Hey guys, I’ve been trying keto for the last two weeks, really enjoying it so far. I find I have steadier energy levels and less crashes throughout the day. Bulletproof coffee is an amazing invention by the way. 
However I’m struggling for quick and simple breakfast/lunch stuff. For the most part it’s bacon and eggs in some capacity but made in different ways. As much as I enjoy it I get my housemates and such questioning how healthy it is to be eating that much bacon. Which does make me wonder if they’re are any quick and simple alternatives for keto breakfast/lunch ideas?

Thanks for any tips guys!"
keto,'The Case for Keto' and my carb addiction,"I recently read **The Case for Keto** by Gary Taubes and it was extremely eye-opening.  It became my new bible or big book or whatever.  I realized how bad I needed to do this WOE - because of my carb addiction.

My carb addiction was causing my insatiable hunger and food cravings. My food cravings were causing UNCONTROLLABLE eating and poor habits.  I would get up out of bed feeling hungry and go shove my face full of crackers just so I could lie down and sleep.

This book helped me understand that it's not my fault - *I'm not weak-willed*.  I needed to break the carb-feed-carb cycle and thus quit the foods that my glucose and insulin were addicted to feeding off of.  Being on keto has done this for me. I am able to stay full and satisfied without judgment or shame for 5 hours between meals now.  It's a miracle.

""And you don't cure an addiction with moderation; you do it with abstinence"" - page 181.

""With diabetes and obesity, your body is essentially a sugar or carbohydrate addict. Telling our patients to moderate intake is telling them to do something that is almost physiologically impossible and keeps the addiction alive.  What we're fighting against is the concept of moderation. It doesn't work."" - page 181.

keto,40 pounds down after 3 months,"I started going to the doctor's office in September to see about weight loss.  I was feeling so heavy and unable to do much.  At the end of November I hit a horrid number.  I was at 480 lbs.  I was just so angry at myself, so deflated.   The weight loss clinic suggested Keto, which I started on December 8th.  I am very fortunate that my wife decided to do it with me.  We really only eat Keto in our house now, but we cook rice and pasta for the kids.  (We usually just go without pasta or use cauliflower rice and cabbage for rice).   I just crept under 440 today, and I feel amazing.

I don't know if it's the lack of gluten, or the glucosamine that I'm taking, but my knees feel fantastic.  I think it's the lack of gluten, which I would have just scoffed at before. All I know is my knees haven't felt this good in over a decade.  I couldn't get off the ground without a crutch or something of some kind.  This isn't a problem anymore.

I have ZERO carb cravings, even for popcorn (my biggest weakness).  My kids can have it near me and I don't care.  (In fact, I don't eat all the snacks anymore, which they used to have to hide from me.)

I really felt out of control back in November.  Right now, I'm feeling amazing, and I can see where I am headed.  I'm losing an average of 2 pounds a week, which is a good rate for me.  I still can't really see it in my body quite yet, because honestly I stopped upsizing my clothes a few years ago.  

My wife has lost many sizes as well. (I don't want to put from what to what  because that's just rude).

I am posting because, honestly, this diet is working amazingly well for me.  If anyone has any questions for me I'll be glad to answer.

(Oh, I started Intermittent Fasting as well.  Why? Because I CAN!  I can go without a meal in the morning without being a total jerk now!)"

&gt; ## Abstract
&gt; 
&gt; In the past three decades, total fat and saturated fat intake as a percentage of total calories has continuously decreased in Western diets, while the intake of omega-6 fatty acid increased and the omega-3 fatty acid decreased, resulting in a large increase in the omega-6/omega-3 ratio from 1:1 during evolution to 20:1 today or even higher. This change in the composition of fatty acids parallels a significant increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity. Experimental studies have suggested that omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids elicit divergent effects on body fat gain through mechanisms of adipogenesis, browning of adipose tissue, lipid homeostasis, brain-gut-adipose tissue axis, and most importantly systemic inflammation. Prospective studies clearly show an increase in the risk of obesity as the level of omega-6 fatty acids and the omega-6/omega-3 ratio increase in red blood cell (RBC) membrane phospholipids, whereas high omega-3 RBC membrane phospholipids decrease the risk of obesity. Recent studies in humans show that in addition to absolute amounts of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acid intake, the omega-6/omega-3 ratio plays an important role in increasing the development of obesity via both AA eicosanoid metabolites and hyperactivity of the cannabinoid system, which can be reversed with increased intake of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A balanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio is important for health and in the prevention and management of obesity. [View Full-Text](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/8/3/128/htm)

&gt;
&gt; ## 6. Conclusions and Recommendations
&gt; 
&gt; -   Human beings evolved on a diet that was balanced in the omega-6 and omega-3 essential fatty acids.
&gt;     
&gt; -   A high omega-6 fatty acid intake and a high omega-6/omega-3 ratio are associated with weight gain in both animal and human studies, whereas a high omega-3 fatty acid intake decreases the risk for weight gain. Lowering the LA/ALA ratio in animals prevents overweight and obesity.
&gt;     
&gt; -   Omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids compete for their biosynthetic enzymes and because they have distinct physiological and metabolic properties, their balanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio is a critical factor for health throughout the life cycle.
&gt;     
&gt; -   Adipose tissue is the main peripheral target organ handling fatty acids, and AA is required for adipocyte differentiation (adipogenesis). The increased LA and AA content of foods has been accompanied by a significant increase in the AA/EPA + DHA ratio within adipose tissue, leading to increased production in AA metabolites, PGI2 which stimulates white adipogenesis and PGF2α which inhibits the browning process, whereas increased consumption of EPA and DHA leads to adipose tissue homeostasis through adipose tissue loss and increased mitochondrial biogenesis.
&gt;     
&gt; -   High omega-6 fatty acid intake leads to hyperactivity of endocannabinoid system, whereas omega-3 fatty acids lead to normal homeostasis (decrease hyperactivity).
&gt;     
&gt; -   High omega-6 fatty acids increase leptin resistance and insulin resistance, whereas omega-3 fatty acids lead to homeostasis and weight loss.
&gt;     
&gt; -   Because a high omega-6/omega-3 ratio is associated with overweight/obesity, whereas a balanced ratio decreases obesity and weight gain, it is essential that every effort is made to decrease the omega-6 fatty acids in the diet, while increasing the omega-3 fatty acid intake. This can be accomplished by (1) changing dietary vegetable oils high in omega-6 fatty acids (corn oil, sunflower, safflower, cottonseed, and soybean oils) to oils high in omega-3s (flax, perilla, chia, rapeseed), and high in monounsaturated oils such as olive oil, macadamia nut oil, hazelnut oil, or the new high monounsaturated sunflower oil; and (2) increasing fish intake to 2–3 times per week, while decreasing meat intake.
&gt;     
&gt; -   In clinical investigations and intervention trials it is essential that the background diet is precisely defined in terms of the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acid content. Because the final concentrations of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are determined by both dietary intake and endogenous metabolism, it is essential that in all clinical investigations and intervention trials the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are precisely determined in the red blood cell membrane phospholipids. In severe obesity drugs and bariatric surgery have been part of treatment.
&gt;     
&gt; -   The risk allele rs 1421085 T to C SNV in intron 1 and 2 in the FTO gene functioned similarly to AA metabolites, PGI2 and PGF2a increasing proliferation of white adipose tissue and decreasing its browning respectively, whereas the knockdown of IRX3 and IRX5 genes functioned similarly to omega-3 fatty acid metabolites increasing the browning of white adipose tissue, mitochondrial biogenesis, and thermogenesis. Therefore, further research should include studies on the effects of omega-3 fatty acids in blocking the effects of the risk allele (rs 1421085), which appears to be responsible for the association between the first intron of FTO gene and obesity in humans.
&gt;     
&gt; -   In the future studies on genetic variants from GWAS will provide opportunities to precisely treat and prevent obesity by both nutritional and pharmaceutical interventions.
&gt;     
&gt; 
&gt; Obesity is a preventable disease that can be treated through proper diet and exercise. A balanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio 1–2/1 is one of the most important dietary factors in the prevention of obesity, along with physical activity. A lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio should be considered in the management of obesity.

keto,Simple and quick snack ideas?,"10 hours of my day is always at the office. I cook everything in our little kitchen but have limited time to spare. So I usually opt to go for the recipes that are quick and easy but still delicious. Eating nuts like cashew and almond is too expensive for me right now but thinking of making my own peanut butter and eat 2 tbsps of it everyday, is it alright to eat peanut butter daily on keto?

Any other quick and easy snack ideas would be much appreciated. Thank you!  


Edit: no food allergies, i'm ok to eat anything"
keto,Am I delusional or has my face gotten skinnier?,"I’m on my fourth day of keto and I swear to god, my double chin looks less doubly. Am I just delusional or is this possible? I was eating a fair amount of sugar and grains prior to starting keto (Portuguese rolls, chips, and ice cream were my faves) but I’ve completely cut all that out and I feel less bloated overall and my chin appears to be skinnier!"
keto,Almost 4 years on keto.....Need advice,"Started keto in the early summer of 2017 at about 350lbs. Within 10-12 months I reached my goal of under 220lbs. I did this on strict keto and not a single day of exercising. I was able to maintain that 220lb to 230lb range up until about this time in 2019. Since 2019 I have gained \~45lbs and my food intake hasn't really changed. The only difference is that I will have a Coke Zero from time to time now. It seems that no matter what I do I cant get back into the weight loss phase. I've tried IF and now I work out 4 times a week (mainly elliptical and bike cardio).

Does your body adjust over time to where keto is no longer as effective? Has anyone else experienced this?

Would it benefit at all to completely stop keto for a few weeks or a month and then restart?

Summary:

Started early summer 2017 - \~350lbs

Hit goal weight in a year - \~220lbs

Currently slowly gaining weight and cant figure it out - \~260lbs"
keto,It just feels so...wrong,"Its day 4 and don't get me wrong. I feel great. I feel less bloated, my energy levels are a bit more consistent, and I'm not craving carbs nearly as much as I expected.
But I'm freaking out a bit. After 17 years of calorie counting, crash dieting, unused gym membership etc, I can't get my head around the idea of losing weight by eating bacon, eggs and steak. I worry that in a month I'll have gained 5 kilos and clogged arteries.

Thanks to anyone who reads this. I don't know what I'm after here...maybe just some reassurance that this works, or any tips to make sure I'm not making some super common cock up!"
keto,I lost 100 pounds in 4 months using Keto and Omad/alternate day fasting.,"https://ibb.co/twf7XLT (bought a renpho scale half way through my weight loss)

I’m 33, 6 ft, 250 pounds

I’m not at my goal yet. Will post before/after pics after I reach my goal.

I was in good shape prior to meeting my wife: https://ibb.co/4R753PN however after living together for years and having a kid my diet went down the gutter. I was still moderately active and could run/lift: https://ibb.co/Fb9NjMB however I had to stop going to the gym due to covid.

My weight exploded. I was 6 ft, 350 pounds on October 22nd and I knew I had to make a change. I started with just Keto. Then added omad. Then alternate day fasts. I have been able break my diet for short vacations without repercussions. My weight balloons for a week then falls. It’s all water.

I’m currently a medical student and recently had a lecture from a bariatric surgeon about how all diets ultimately are statistically the same with regards to weight loss. He recommended that someone with my former BMI would be able to reach a normal weight via surgery. 

I feel like keto is different and it’s possible for large weight loss with this diet (I know it’s a personal anecdote) - I don’t experience hunger. I’ve tested this to 72 hour fasts and I feel fine.

I have no underlying medical conditions and I make sure to get blood work regularly and my electrolytes/albumin fell about 2 months in so I upped the protein, lowered the fat (switched from ribeye steaks to chicken breast) and supplemented with more ketoaid and the issue fixed itself.

I didn’t think it would be possible to lose weight this quickly. I just wanted to thank this community for all the information that is readily available for people like me.

The one negative I would say is that I’ve lost a lot of muscle. I doubt I could bench even 2 plates atm. I’m curious about how my lifts will look once the gyms reopen where I’m at."
keto,Need help/clarification about weight loss for Type1 Diabetics,"Hi, my girlfriend is a t1 diabetic, and we've recently started doing keto + intermittent fasting. It has only been a couple of days but she managed to reduce her amount of bolus (mealtime) insulin units to 4, which is great. Her basal (dripping) insulin was at 33 yesterday and we hope that will go down in time as well. (Considering her regular daily total amount was at 50-60s just last week, it's great progress) We mainly started this for weight loss, but hope to stay doing it for the long term cause it's great for her a1c as well. 

My confusion is this: I follow Dr. Eric Berg and other sources and I've read that even tiny amounts of insulin in the blood can take you out of fat burning, so for people without t1 diabetes, they suggest fasting and low carb, but since a t1 diabetic needs the constant stream of dripping basal insulin all day long, does that mean they won't be able to go into fat burning mode even though they are doing keto + if? Or does dripping insulin doesn't effect it that much?

My girlfriend uses a pump for her insulin, she doesn't use different types of insulin for mealtime and dripping, she sets it on the pump and the same type on insulin is injected as basal, and after the meals she manually sets how much she needs and that's her bolus. 

Apologies if I'm being oblivious, I'm fairly new to this condition and research but want to learn more. I've seen lots of t1 diabetics in this sub having success with keto and if, so I thought I could get some help.

Thanks in advance."
keto,"Second time on keto, no results","Hello everyone, 
Last summer (2019) i’ve lost around 10 kg on keto in about a month, which was pretty amazing. 
However, because of the stress about COVID and work (also, the lockdown didn’t help) i’ve regained much more than i’ve lost. So, for the last month i’ve been back on keto and so far no results... 

I’m 1m71cm (5’7) and 100kg (220 pounds) at the moment.
Last time I started keto i was 15kg lighter and my perfect number of calories was 1500-1550 a day. I started with that this time, but nothing was moving, so i’ve decided to take it to 1600-1650 a day, as I’m much bigger now. Still no change. 

I’m eating around 130grams of fat, 70g of protein and 6g of net carbs. Also doing intermittent fasting and some physical activity. 

I’m feeling pretty good, not hungry, no cravings, so it kind of shocks me that there is no progress so far. 

Also eating clean keto, with the only exception of cheese. I’m thinking of cutting it to see if it helps, but I have no idea where to get my calories from otherwise. 

I’m eating the same thing everyday : veal meat, eggs, cheese, nuts, olive oil, avocado and salads with green leafs"

I've been supplementing with a multimineral pill, magnesium oil ( applied to skin), a zinc tablet, and even some other pills for vitamin deficiencies. I used to take this on an empty stomach each morning, but now take it with meals and don't drink coffee close to meal time. Still deficient: -(

keto,Is &lt;1000 kcal causing diarrhea?,"I started keto in January and kind of lost some weight in two months (SW 85 KG (187 lb), CW 77 KG (170 lb)). But i was cheating often so i decided to do IF since it won't let me even eat the whole day and so lesser chances of carb craving.

I started 23:1 IF to lose weight faster because offline college will reopen soon and I want to feel confident when that happens. My keto calorie limit was 1490 kcal. And MyFitnessPal doesn't log my daily diet if I make an entry of less than 1000 kcal.

Is &lt;1000 kcal OMAD causing diarrhea? If I keep doing this for two months will it harm me because I eat &lt;1000 kcal? When doing OMAD, I can't eat much beyond a maximum of 750 kcal and many times even lesser. Should I eat peanuts to make-up for the remaining 250 kcal?"

As you all know, your appetite can and often will go way down when fat adapted. 

My question is:

When one meal of let’s say 700 cals plus a 100 cal coffee fills you up and you have zero desire to eat more, should you force yourself to ensure you come in at a minimum recommended cals?? 
Or
Because you’re fat adapted and your body is using fat stores for energy, it’s not a big deal that you’re under minimum calorie recommendation? 

I’d love to know your ideas.

keto,Homemade quest bars are back on the menu,"I noticed IMO syrup (vitafibre brand) which was the main ingredient inquest bars is no longer available on amazon, or anywhere else, and turns out the FDA decided that this is not digested like fiber, and it does indeed spipe your blood sugar, so quest stopped using it in their bars and people stopped selling it.

&amp;#x200B;

Quest's new ingredient is Corn fiber. Tastes the same to me. Unfortunatly I could not find any corn fiber syrup on amazon or anything, but I found some puder suppliments that don't seem to be marketed for making snacks, so I was concerned it wouldn't work but  it sure does.

keto,Gaining weight &amp; fat on keto,"(23F 176cm/5’9)

A month ago I did a body scan through F45 and got 17.9% body fat and weighed 65kg/143lbs. 

I started keto a few days prior to the scan and focused on hitting my macros for the next month (&lt; 20 net carbs etc). I’m pretty active, hitting 20k steps most days and attending F45 classes 5-6 days a week. 

I didn’t really worry about calories, I just wanted to get used to the lifestyle and foods. With that said, I just ate until satiated with some days indulging in more. 

It’s been a month and I did an update body scan to see how I was going on keto. My body fat was exactly the same, 17.9% but I gained fat (~400g) and muscle (~1.5kg). Overall, I gained about 3kg (6.6lbs)- from 65 to 68kg. 

Im obviously stoked about gaining muscle but really wanted to decrease my body fat %. Aesthetically I can see I’m softer as well. 

Would tracking and cutting down my calories to 1500 a day strictly but still following keto be the solution to this? I really wanted to follow something maintainable long term where I wasn’t thinking about calories constantly (hence why keto)

Perhaps the lack of energy in the transitional stage of eating carbs to keto meant I didn’t work out as hard? 

I would love some suggestions on what I can tweak or a reality check on what I’m doing wrong!"
keto,Thought on supplements and electrolytes,"I’ve really enjoyed the Keto lifestyle; I’m losing fat, feeling stronger, sleeping better, all that good stuff.  I have been thinking, though:  I want to do this long term, but in order to feel 100% while eating Keto, I have to take a b-complex, potassium, electrolytes, magnesium, vitamin D, copper, and zinc.  It made me wonder:  how good can this really be for me if I have to take so many supplements because my diet isn’t sufficient to deliver what I need?

Has anyone else thought along this line?  Did you find any good answer?"

keto,Does always eating the same foods cause nausea?,"I vary my diet a little, but mostly I eat chicken as well as broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, peas, long green beans, tomato and small mounts of maize and bell pepper (plus various vegetable oils for fat). I thought my diet is diverse enough in terms of nutrients but I get terrible nausea quite often. Today I ate sauerkraut, mushroom salad and some cold cuts instead and didn't feel nauseated at all. Is my body just sick of the same foods even if I get enough nutrients from them? I take bouillon cubes for salt as well as potassium citrate and magnesium threonate so I don't think it's about sodium, magnesium or potassium."
keto,Appetite Loss help,"Hey Guys, I just recently (last month) picked up keto seriously and I've been doing it in combination with IF. I'm finding that I have no appetite when it's time to eat. Like my brain says it's time but my body's like nah. Or I'd force myself and eat maybe an avocado and I'm full.
Has anyone else experienced this? How do you deal with it? I'm specifically concerned about not getting enough calories and nutrients."

keto,Where can I read about keto impact and effect on your organs?,"Hello   


As title says I was curious how keto affects organs. What are positives and negatives if any. I know keto helped people to cure fatty liver for example but I am not sure where to look for creditable source of information what it does to organs and how. 

Thanks"
keto,Don't forget Nutrition!,"Things that might help\*

* Supplemental vitamins if you are restricting calories (include biotin).
* Take antioxidants.  I reserve a small amount of carbs for [blueberries or acai berries](https://www.superfoodly.com/highest-antioxidant-berry/#1_Acai_73000), but most of the time, I mix [raw cacao](https://www.superfoodly.com/orac-value/cocoa-dry-powder-unsweetened/) with my coffee in the grinder.  It is a wonderful source with a very high [ORAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_radical_absorbance_capacity) score. 100g of cacao has an ORAC score of 55,000 and blueberries are about 9,000.  Coffee itself is an antioxidant, and while the score isn't as high, it is where most people get most of their antioxidants.  Antioxidants counteract the negative effect *excess* ketones have on your body.
* Another good way to limit the effect of excess ketones is to limit your calorie consumption.   
* Hopefully your body is not getting nutrition from your muscles.  Even light exercise will help you maintain muscle mass.
* Don't restrict calories too much (varies per person) or your body will go into starvation mode and all kinds of bad things can happen.

keto,Strawberry’s,"I just started the Keto way of living 5 days ago and I feel great after a few days of the dreaded Keto flu. A couple days ago I bought whipped cream and strawberries for my gf cause she loves them and I was bummed out cause I thought I couldn’t include that in my keto diet. I was under the impression that strawberries were like all the other high sugar fruits so I kinda just told her “ enjoy 😢”. But with some quick research, I learned that both whipped cream AND strawberries are keto friendly in moderate amounts and I was over the moon! This diet gets better every time  I learn something new about it. I feel better in less than a week than I’ve felt my whole life. I’m a believer for life."
keto,My first 28 days on Keto/Carnivore (before/after pics included),"[Before/ After Pics ](https://imgur.com/gallery/QCll62U)

SW 289 CW 277 First GW 249

Foods I consumed;
Mostly beef, chicken, bacon, pork, eggs, pork rinds, processed cheese, jalapeños and pickles. I drink tea, Pure Protein shakes and water. 

Exercise;
I am currently doing a 12 week program from BodyFit by Kris Gethin. I completed his program multiple times in the past. I had great results. They are charging for the workouts now. 

My experience;
I am loving this WOE! In the past I did Keto only but I overate on keto approved sweeteners 😩😩 By eating mainly meat, my sweet cravings are gone! Every kind of Girl Scout cookie are on my table right now and I’m not phased by them! Before February I would binge on sweets. I could go through a Costco size of ice cream drumstick cones in two days!!! My excuse was well they are no longer in the house so I won’t want them anymore. That was a continuous cycle that I had to break! My dad told me I needed to learn willpower but I couldn’t while eating a SAD.  I first plan to do this WOE for 90 days but now I don’t see myself stopping! 
As for working out, I was three weeks into the workout program when I started this WOE. I noticed a small loss of energy and stamina in the 1st week( I do cardio/weightlifting in a fasted state) but now that I’m fat adapted I have no problem with my workouts! I normally eat two meals but sometimes I need three on heavier lifting days. I listen to my body now when it comes to food instead of my mind. 

I shall KCKCO(Keep calm,Keto-carnivore On)!!!😁😁"
keto,2 weeks on keto,Hey all. I’ve been doing keto for about 2 weeks. I am very strict and following it to the T. The only thing is I’m not counting calories. I know for a fact I’ve been eating under 25 grams of carbs 30 max. I am 5’7 and 164. I’ve only lost 4 lbs and I just feel discouraged because I don’t really see a difference. I’m trying not to weight myself all the time only once a week. I’m just getting pretty tired of this already because the first time I did keto the weight melted off. Now it is pretty slow and it’s been so hard because family around me eats whatever. I’m staying strong though and reading people’s post is encouraging. I guess I’m just venting. I feel like giving up but I want it bad and I’m tired of feeling bad about myself and my body. I haven’t weighed myself in a couple of days so I hope so more has came off or I just hope to see change in my body. Only thing is I’m less bloated. I also have to force myself to eat because I’m not hungry a lot of times I’ll only eat one meal and feel fine. I don’t know I don’t expect anyone to answer I really just needed to vent I feel pretty alone doing this diet. The people around me think I don’t need it but I know I do because I am over weight
keto,Day 7 - My Observations,"1. Actually started cutting out gluten and sugar at the on 1/28 and keeping carbs low, but not tracking them, on 2/20.  On 2/24 started keto in full and using the Chronometer app.
2. When I started cutting out gluten, after a few days I noticed my knee joints didn't ache.
3. When I started tracking with Chronometer app, SW was 201.  This morning I weighed in at 193.  That is 8 pounds gone, and even if it was water weight, I have always had a struggle.
4. Donated blood.  My local blood bank measures your cholesterol and reports that to you.  Last time in December my cholesterol level was 222.  This time it was 181.
5. I have had success in the past with Weight Watchers but found it both tiresome and expensive.  Plus, after reading up on keto and carbs in general, I realize that for a lot of people telling them fruits, including bananas, are ""zero points"" is a recipe for disaster, as well as giving low points to things like ""fat free"" stuff.   And it was hard not to be hungry all the time.  Now?  I'm not hungry.
6. I have A1C levels that I need to watch, and I don't want to develop Type 2 diabetes and wind up on medication.  I realize that like it or not, for someone like me, carbs make me bloated, cause me to break out, gives me heartburn . . . and crave more carbs.
7. I will be 60 on my next birthday, so I have had a lifetime of eating things that were not the best for me.  That means adapting to a new way of eating is not so bad.  In fact, bread now to me is somewhat boring - I would rather appreciate the filling for the sandwich.    That being said, I like Aldi's L'Oven bread as a handy sandwich ""holder"" and I like the slight, sweet-ish flavor of coconut flour for a 90-second mug keto bread - the latter reminds me of savory cornbread (I live in the South and cornbread is usually not sweetened like a cake because it is meant to accompany things like BBQ and beans).
8. Who says I can't have some ground beef and cabbage sauteed in a pan for breakfast?  That is one thing I have going for me, I have never thought that any meal ""has to"" be something because it is breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
9. Kerrygold butter from Ireland is wonderful.
10. Tried a bulletproof coffee today because I wanted a cup of coffee on my way home from photographing a proposal (I'm a photographer).  I found it . . . meh.  I might order it again if I pass by that coffee kiosk in the future, but a regular cup of coffee and a buttered 90-second keto biscuit on a rainy afternoon is a nice treat at my desk.
11. If you have a Kroger brand grocery store near you, check out when they discount packaged salads (the ones with the ""woo-hoo"" stickers.  A lot of them are kale, brussel sprouts, broccoli, and cabbage instead of lettuce.  Toss out the pre-packaged dressing and other things and use the greens for stir fry (or a salad but I like stir fry better)."
keto,Progress!,"I haven't been strict keto since the end of December. I'm usually sticking to under 20g net carbs during the week and treating myself on the weekends, mostly staying low carb but have gone all out too, haha. I'm in a relationship and my partner is not keto, but I'm so grateful for him, he is always so helpful at meal planning keto meals with me when we are together.

I keep up with weighing myself and have been feeling a little discouraged because I've only lost about 5 lbs since December. I don't work out a lot but I do \~30 min of cardio \~3 times a week.

The other day I noticed some pants that I fit into again just a few months ago were loose, so I decided to measure myself for the first time in almost 6 months. I was surprised to see that I have lost 6in around my hips! 8in total around my hips! Also, lost 3in around my thigh for 4in total! Those were my worst problem areas. This morning I noticed the cellulite in my thighs has been getting much better and I'm starting to feel more confident.

I'm 36lbs away from my goal, more than half way from when I started. Happy to continue this journey!"
keto,Is MCT oil/ coconut oil in coffee etc hype or does it actually increase ketosis?,I was considering buying some MCT oil/coconut oil and adding it to my black coffee first thing in the morning before doing my daily exercise. But I can’t figure out if it’s better than just sticking to the plain black coffee. I mean it’s still calories and part of me gets the rip-off/hype vibes from every MCT product out there. But then I wonder if there is truth in the claims I would definitely be interested in making this part of my routine.
keto,What am I missing?,"Hey everyone, I have a question that I'm hoping someone here can answer. I'm on week four of keto, had a nice initial loss in the first two weeks of 9 pounds. As I'm logging my food today I wondered to myself, ""Can I achieve the same results by just cutting calories?"" because I haven't lost any more weight and I was told it's because I must be eating too many calories. According to MFP I'm not, but I must have. Anywho, my question is do you really lose more weight by eating keto than JUST cutting calories? Side note- I HAVE experienced other benefits from keto such as some of my PCOS symptoms are not AS bad as they used to be and I don't have cravings anymore. But I'm really here to lose weight and if keto isn't doing it, and it truly is about cutting calories I'd like to have an apple."

keto,Keto is giving me insomnia — 8 weeks in,"I’ve been doing well on keto! I started Jan 3 2021. 

So far:

Net carbs 40g
Protein 110g
Fat under 80g 

Calories on average 1460, but I do down to 1200 frequently and up to 2000 infrequently. I averaged all of my calories so far to get my average caloric intake (1461). 

I can’t sleep. I’m tired (exhausted) but I can’t sleep. I’m up until 3am ish most nights then up with the baby around 6am. This is really killing me and making it difficult to loose weight. 

Any insights? I used to be a bad insomniac so I am not napping (napping is the worst thing for chronic insomnia), have good sleep habits (no phone in the bedroom, no screen directly before going to bed, cool comfortable room, etc). Given that I’ve been using my sleep routine for ten years to address the insomnia and it suddenly isn’t working makes me think it might be keto? 

Any suggestions?"
keto,"""Clean"" keto","Hi, has anyone gone from ""dirty"" keto to ""clean"" or ""healthy"" keto, and, if so, were there any remarkable impacts on your weight/health/body?  By ""dirty"" keto, as I've been practicing it, I mean, more processed foods that are keto (verified low net carb), like keto ""granola,"" keto ice creams, keto yogurts, intermixed with cheeses, meats, and some veggies. By clean keto, I am moving towards no or very little ""processed"" keto foods (I can't give up my keto syrup--yet) and eating more low carb veggies and more meat and salmon.  Just wondering if anyone has noticed any significant difference after making such a transition. Thank you in advance!"
keto,I am officially in the 300 lb bracket,"I often see how every one post success posts, and this is the first time I have seen a weight that started with 3 in quite some time.

Just really excited, have no one else to share with, and hopefully this will further reaffirm those who are on the fence that they are “too big” for keto or something that you really can do it."
keto,8 weeks in and going strong!,"SW 198, CW 174, GW 166

This is now my 5/6 time doing keto.  I tend to get to my GW or near it then gradually go back to my former carb lifestyle then cycle back once i see the scale heading the wrong way.  I think this time I am going to keep it going,  add a little more calories and actually try to lift weights as well.  My advise for those thinking about trying keto is make sure you drink plenty of water and electrolytes your first week,  this has always helped me immensely getting thru the Keto flu,  and in fact this go around I didn't even have any negative side effects.

keto,How my first 30 days on keto went,"So today marks my 30th day on keto. On the third day (because I’m forgetful) I weighed in at 270lbs and now I weigh at 260-261. So about a 10 pound loss which is good. I have mixed feeling about it because I didn’t know what to expect with the rate of weight loss so I don’t know if losing 10 pounds in a month is not that great and could be better. But at the same time given how long I stayed around 270-275 (many many years) I’m not that let down by the result. It probably was just water weight but I do feel pretty good overall. I didn’t have much of a keto flu, when I started to get light headed I drank chicken broth and that just made the rest of keto just normal. I minifast usually 8pm to 12pm next day. No cheat days so far.

I said that after 4 weeks I’d consider whether I want to continue keto aaaand I’m not going to quit keto. I don’t know how long I’m going to be on it, as of right now I view it as a temporary thing so maybe I’ll wait until week 8 or week 10 (it’d be nice to lose a lot of weight in this period before my birthday). But this is the second time I tried keto (first time I had to quit early due to personal stuff) and the food is so much better than what I ate the first time. I know more than I did back then which feels better now that I don’t have to stick to a fat/protein ratio. So although I live with others and crave whatever they’re cooking, the food I make is pretty good so I’m not losing my craving of keto food like the first time.

But yeah that is an update on my situation. Let me know if you have any tips for future weeks :)"

keto,"Wife and I lost 90 lbs combined, still going","So it is what the header is. My wife started keto nov 1st. She has Hashimoto's disease and her doctor recommended it as she weighed 255.

I love stuffing and cranberry. Not being able to eat it at the level I do was tough but I made it through it. I started at 365lbs.  This is the heaviest we have been our whole lives. We both are very dedicated to keeping 95% true to the diet. We believe in having tiny cheats daily because a cheat day in our eyes doesnt help.

keto,Making the jump....supplement help....,"Getting ready to make the jump into keto. Been doing a bunch of research and I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on the actual diet and food choices.

D3, been taking 10,000 UI daily for some time now...blood tests showed low levels.

K2, 200 mcg daily

Just got:

Magnesium but unsure how much to take.

Fish Oil 2.8g daily, 1294mg EPA and 506mg DHA

Collagen 20g daily + whatever I get from 8 ounces of daily homemade bone broth.

Electrolytes: this is where most of my confusion comes in. How much salt, potassium, magnesium should I take daily and do I need to supplement calcium too?

And other supplements recommended for keto and just general health? And is there any timing concerns or can I just take a handful in the morning and be done with it for the day?"
keto,Sticking with keto as a houseguest,"My mom got her second COVID shot, so my family is decamping to grandmas house for a change of scenery for remote work/school.  I’m super excited, except for the food situation.  Breakfast is easy, I usually have coffee with collagen protein &amp; heavy cream. Any time we have takeout, I’m good; I know what to order.   

But I’m not sure what to do when she wants to fix like sandwiches or something. And worse is when she cooks dinners, she will usually do chicken or a big piece of salmon (both fine), but her side dishes are like potatoes or rice and a super minimal bit of veggies.  I’m thinking I could maybe offer to cook a couple nights, so I can make something with a better keto-friendly side dish. 

It’s both the “what do I eat?” And the “how do I manage to eat what I need to without being an assh*** houseguest?”"

keto,Almost pain free and no sugar cravings after 12 days.,"I want to sincerely say thank you to this group as I can’t believe the difference in my life has taken after just 12 days. This is my second try at keto. I tried it for about two months in fall 2019, before the pandemic. I lost 20 pounds. Then I moved, and then the pandemic came, and I went on a crazy sugar binge for comfort, like many people did. I gained all my weight back +15. I was at the mercy of sugar cravings, and also I was the highest weight I’ve ever been in my life. I’ve basically been gaining and losing the same 50 pounds my whole life. Also, in the past month, I’ve gone to a series of doctors to try to diagnose the shooting pains that have been going up and down my arms and legs at night. The quality of my sleep has been terrible, and my daily fatigue and depression bad. I finally saw a rheumatologist who said that I might have fibromyalgia and he offered to give me medication. I decided to make some changes in my lifestyle first. And boy am I glad I did. The main thing I’m astounded at is in just 12 days I can finally sleep on my side at night again without the pain shooting down my arms and legs. And no sugar cravings!!! At all. I’m ecstatic about that. I’ve lost 5 pounds in 12 days. I can probably do better with counting my fat and carb macros. I’ve been averaging about 100 g of fat and maybe about 21 carbohydrates grams a day. But I don’t mind the slower pace of losing weight. That will come. And I got the most amazing tips from reading this group.  I took my time researching and reading this group before I restarted keto again this time around. A big thank you to r/keto. I look forward to reporting my progress."
keto,One year on keto,"Just about a year ago, I decided it was time for a change.  I had gone to the doctor to get something looked and and she immediately scheduled me to get my liver scanned and blood work done, and being 321 lbs, obviously I was in danger of some serious health issues.  Losing weight from eating keto, my sleep apnea is gone. My daily need for heart burn medicine is no longer needed. I've lost 88 lbs, and people can hardly recognize me anymore, going from a bloated morbidly obese person, to a slimmed down version of who I used to be in high school.  Having co-workers, casual acquaintances, and even close family becoming inspired by little old me feels overwhelming sometimes. I've never been one to inspire others, but helping people make better decisions about their health feels so good. It's like boomerang inspiration, I give it to them, then they give it right back to me!  So KCKO my fellow keto-people!

keto,Keto saved my life. 75lbs down!,"My first language is Spanish, so I apologize for any grammatical errors.

I'm a 20y/o, 6’1” tall male.
I started Keto on the 2nd of September at 350lbs. After 25 weeks I’m at 275lbs. 
I’ve lost 75 pounds in only a few months. I'm halfway there. My goal is to weigh under 200 pounds.

Progress pics: https://imgur.com/gallery/XxEaP9S

Now some backstory about myself:

I’ve been obese my entire life. I was bullied throughout elementary school for being fat, this only caused me to find comfort in food. I started so many diets, beginning when I was in 4th grade. Only once did I lose a lot of weight with diets, this was in 2013/14 when I lost about 23kg (50 pounds). But after I managed to lose all of that weight, my family and I moved to the United States. Shortly after moving here, I gained back way more than I lost. Speaking little to no English was tough. I used to be an extroverted person with lots of friends, but suddenly I was alone. I became someone who would not leave the bedroom unless it was necessary. I started having thoughts and feelings of self-hatred in 2015, and they keep intensifying as time passed. No person in my life knows about it but I've been depressed for about six years. I used food to cope with my emotions. I would eat all day and I wouldn't stop eating until I physically was not able to keep going. I wondered how normal people knew if they were “full,” as “full” to me meant “when your stomach aches and you are close to throwing up.” I was consciously eating myself to death. 
Fast forward to early-2020. I meet this girl at work and we become extremely close friends, we're both the same age and into the same things. I have never believed that girls would be interested in me, not only because of me being extremely overweight but because I have a very low opinion about myself. We would talk ALL THE TIME, we would play video games together, and we would stay up until 6 in the morning texting and sending each other funny pictures of ourselves. After some time she started to constantly send me flirty texts, however, I believed she didn't mean them like that because who the fuck would ever be flirty with me? As I learned later, it seems that she liked me, and.. well... I REALLY LIKED HER, I liked her more than I have ever liked anyone in my entire life. But being insecure and thinking no girl could ever like me led to me not doing shit about it. She thought that I wasn’t interested, then she was having problems at home and moved to a different city and kinda stopped talking to me. This, plus a lot more shit that happened in between sunk me even deeper. I hit rock bottom mentally. I felt truly torn to pieces. Life hadn't had any meaning for years, but then I somehow felt even worse. I started a journal, in which I would write my thoughts mostly every day. I tried taking a look at it a few days ago and I simply cannot believe I felt like that. Those were the worst months of my life. I couldn’t function. I couldn’t do things that I would previously do all the time. I couldn’t watch movies or series, I couldn’t play video games, I couldn’t talk to anyone, I couldn’t even think clearly. All I could do to pass the time was to go on 5-6 hour drives listening to The Smiths and Joy Division, and playing “I Know It’s Over” (by The Smiths) and “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You” (by Led Zeppelin) on a loop. According to Spotify Wrapped, I listened to the Smiths for around 400 hours, and I listened to “I Know It’s Over” 440 times. I’m impressed with that considering I started listening to the Smiths in June 2020. 

About a month later, seeing all of this self-hatred and hopelessness, I said to myself “fuck it, I might as well try to get better, what can I lose?”
So I made a list of things I had to work on, 12 things that I wanted to change/improve. So I took action. I started seeing one of my school’s therapists, I picked up drumming again, and I chose to start Keto, amongst other things. All I knew about keto was that one of my aunts was on it and she had lost a bunch of weight. I started Keto on the 2nd of September, three days after making that list. Now it's been over 25 weeks and I have lost 75 pounds. My goal is to lose 150. I love to be Keto, and I truly want to stay on it for the rest of my life, as Keto saved my life. 

Now, I wouldn’t say that I’m happy, but I am in a really good place compared to where I had been for the past few years. And I am motivated to continue and at the very least reach a point where I feel comfortable in my own body.

TL;DR
Depressed for years, hit rock bottom. Been on keto since September 2nd and I’m halfway through. I feel better now, but still, a long way to go."
keto,How many Net Carbs for Ketosis for me?,"For reference, I’m 5’8 and 247 pounds current and I just began ketosis about a week ago. Reddit has really helped me in finding some great recipes and substitutes for the things I eat more often.

keto,A bad rap about Keto? Real research?,"
So there was a topic about carbohydrates and how 
they are the main source of fuel for the body and we should be eating complex ones , and how really really restricting em is bad for the brain , then it said this..... “

“Ketones are mildly acidic. They can build up in the blood and make it more acidic. Over time this may be harmful to the body.”

Is that true about ketones? Do they do that over time?"
keto,Weird stop in my progres,"English not first language.

Anyhow. I got diagnose with like pre-pre-NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). Caught very early which is good, caused by over weight. So keto for me.
I eat a strict diet like 20 carb/day so that if I make a mistake or miscalculated I would not break keto.

I started keto diet in late october and started working out like 4 times/week in january. Weight started to go down in november. 

A couple weeks ago I had to eat at a restaurant and chose what seemed low carb/LCHF. Only ate a little bit as I was sharing with the kids.
My stomach cramped like hell the next day. I almost feinted. I got bloated, my stomach stood up like it was pregnant and now still is large and puffy, but not a balloon. Since then my weight has not gone down.

I have ordered keto sticks to check my ketone levels, but since I eat strictly it should not be an issue.

My PT thinks I might have gas or something but I don't fart or burp. I am plateauing or is it normal to suddenly not loose weight?"
keto,Question about Keto Rash and when it occurs,I’m currently going into my 10th week of Keto and have had great results so far. Around 6 weeks in I started to notice a small rash develop on my lower stomach and some of my back. Was curious if anyone else has experienced this 6 weeks into the diet because I find it odd that it would pop up that far into it. I’ve been using hydrocortisone cream twice a day but the rash has stayed but hasn’t spread any further or gotten more red. I change my sheets to my bed every 2-3 days and haven’t made any changes with laundry detergent so I know I can rule those causes out. Has anyone else experienced something similar?
keto,Plateaued,"I started keto in September of 2020. I lost weight pretty quickly. About 50 pounds in 3 and half months. But it's been about two months and I've plateaued. I haven't seen any more weight loss. I've had the relatively same eating habits since I've started, although not great. During my work week I have a bad habit of eating one big meal a day. Given the nature of my job its not uncommon for me to have to work for 16 hrs a day, then be off for 8 hrs then back to work. On those days cooking is not an option so a usually get fast food. Typically stuff like the parm salad at wendys and two grilled chicken sandwiches, no buns and if I'm really hungry I'll get a hamburger, no buns as well. Am I shooting myself in the foot for eating like this? Is it effecting my metabolism? What should I try and do instead? I tried the slim fast keto replacement bars and one usually doesn't hold me over."
keto,Keto and TRT,"Hi guys, I have been having an issue with low t symptoms for some time ( 5 years to be exact ). I have used keto to lose 60 pounds ( from 220 to 160 at 6 feet and 4 inches tall ). That has been 5 years ago and pretty much I kept my weight from 160 to 180. Now, I am at 175 lbs and pretty OK with this weight. Soon, I will be starting self administrated TRT because of symptoms ( no libido and ED ) because here in EU it is pretty much mission impossible to get it. I am at pretty OK body fat, but still to minimize conversion from T to estrogen want to hop on keto to minimize negative effects. Any guys here on TRT and what can I expect?"
keto,Ho to become successful with keto,"People usually start keto to loose weight. However if you change your approach toward being more healthy rather than just loose weight you will get better results and here is why.

Loosing weight is like a short term project but to be healthy and remain healthy you have to think about a long term future. This can only be achieved when you look at keto as a lifestyle and not only a diet.

Now it is time to answer a million dollars question. What helps us to pick a healthy lifestyle and be committed to that? My answer first and before every thing else is knowledge and deeply understanding of what is happening in our body when we eat a food or perform an activity.

When I talk about understanding, how much I mean? Should I study about the body like a doctor? No. We need to understand it in a way that we can explain it for our grand mother and convenience her to pick this lifestyle.

Since I have started keto I have tried to learn more every day and constantly listen to my body to see how it reacts to the changes. Our body is the best guide toward putting light on what we are doing right or wrong."
keto,Eating has become a chore..,"I've come to the point where I absolutely hate to eat. Right now I average between 1260-1400 calories.. doing my best to get to 1380 at least but as of late I just do not have the appetite nor do I have the drive to do it. So the most I've been getting is like 1230-1290..

I don't mind the cooking aspect, I love it. Knowing that I have to eat that food eventually though is such a drag. I'm not necessarily full either.. there's just no appetite. I don't want to cheat my body out of anything but man..

I do IF, maybe that's a contributor but I'm struggling. 

Sorry just ranting and raving."
keto,Hunger for certain foods,"I'm two months in zerocarb and always ate different foods and meals. But since 2 weeks, the only foods, that I want, are dairy (kefir) and eggs. The Problem is, that I fear the carbs from dairy and when I eat boiled eggs (I love them and can't get enough of them), I feel very tired.

Should I eat the eggs raw?"
keto,hey again guys :) do you count calories? ive read differing subjective opinions.,"and i know i know fat=full for longer, but ignoring everything else,

do \*you\* count calories? Or, maybe you used to and then you stopped counting? did you continue to get results? or maybe you never counted and didnt get results but then started counting and then you started getting results?

let me know what you think/did :)"
keto,"For &lt;20/10 Net daily carbs, share your strategy","I'm more than capable of doing this type of stuff on my own by now (I've been cycling for years now) but I was curious what thoughts people had on their successes and failures when trying to go ""extreme"" whether it's to get back on the horse, stay on it, or to curb plateauing."
keto,[236&gt;123=113lbs] F/22/5’2 First six months of maintenance after five years of WL,"This March represents six months of maintaining a normal/healthy BMI after being overweight for my entire life. I slowly lost with keto (on and off) over the last five years. I included a link to a collage that does a pretty good job showing my progress throughout that time.[236-123=113](https://imgur.com/a/J5z2KqR)
I never thought I could get to this point. I thought I was destined to fail on every diet until I started Keto. Keto was first the tool that helped me learn to keep my appetite in check, but has since become a catalyst towards my interests in nutrition and fitness. Since I genuinely started to enjoy both of those things, my progress and mindset has been completely reshaped. 
While WL was a steady challenge for me, maintenance was grueling at first. I went back to tracking calories to make sure I ate enough; it was so difficult for me to avoid slipping back into WL. 
The biggest lesson I’ve learned throughout is that my health takes lifelong maintenance.  I’m probably going to be reassessing/adjusting my eating habits to suit my lifestyle for the rest of it, but that’s okay. Looking back, my eating habits have ranged from binging to over-restricting. I’m happy to have gotten to the point where this is no longer the case and my pursuit of health comes from a place of kindness and understanding.  
I hope this resonates with some of you if you’re using keto for WL. I hope you ignore the self-hatred and try to find positive sources of motivation, too. You can do it!"
keto,Running has become a struggle womppp,"I started the keto diet on February 15th and am enjoying it so far - making the dishes has been quite fun. However, I'm really struggling with my runs. I used to go 7 to 12ish miles and now I'm super tired after 3 to 4 miles. My muscles are just so fatigued by then. To my fellow keto runners - how long does this last? Any advice?"
keto,Not fazed by a small weight gain,"Just wanted to mention something I noticed, after 2 months on keto with IF:

I've been averaging 2# loss a week (GW is a lo-o-o-ng way off) and feeling fabulous. Yesterday, I stepped on the scale and had a 3# gain over last week. 

In the past when I did CICO and exercising like a mad woman, such devastating news would have thrown me off track. Instead, I am sanguine about it and not worried a bit. I think it's because this new way of eating isn't torturous deprivation. I actually enjoy it, and I don't have to work out (a hated activity). The only exercises I do are things I enjoy- walking my dog and gardening.

I know I'm doing a good job of keto-ing and fasting, so that 3# will soon disappear. I see this new attitude as a subtle success over self-sabotage.

I hope this helps someone NOT to freak out over the ups &amp; downs."
keto,Has anyone here tired both keto and carnivore diet? Which did you like better?,"Carnivore sub wouldn't accept this question because they don't like any mention of plant food at all...they wanted me to ask here instead.  I realize that asking here will skew the answers towards people who want to include plant food in their diet, but oh well.

My question is....

Has anyone here tried both a 100% carnivore diet, and an almost-carnivore diet (keto with mostly animal food, minimal plant food), and if so, which of those diets led you to feel healthier?  Did you feel any noticeable difference between those 2 diets - energy levels, sleep, concentration, hunger levels, etc etc?"
keto,[Other] General discussion on working with your doctor on Keto,"(I read the rules and posted this (using different wording) a while back in the daily beginner's thread but it never got any replies.)

Has anybody here found a general practitioner/family doctor that won't treat your Keto as just another fad diet?  The reason I ask is that I tried Keto a year or two ago and very quickly felt the results but didn't work with my doctor on it.  So when time came for my annual physical, she lumped my cholesterol readings together into a generic ""your cholesterol is VERY high!"", freaking me out, so I stopped.  Even though I know that LDL and HDL should be monitored separately, along with some other metabolic markers, I let her sway me into stopping.

So, recently a friend of mine who is diabetic and has thyroid issues has started Keto under the advice of her endocrinologist.  She's also very much a researcher and very intelligent, so she's done her homework and passed the info along to me.  I'm not diabetic but could be soon if I don't get my weight down, no problems with my thyroid but all the women in my family have so it's likely just a matter of time, and I have inflammation/autoimmune issues, so I'm sure Keto would be excellent for me..... but want to work with a knowledgeable doctor this time.  I need to find one, though.  I've been debating going to my friend's endocrinologist but not sure if that makes sense for this (i.e. preventative care).  Or would it be smarter to set up appts with a handful of family doctors and ask each one if they know and support Keto, and then stick with that one?  I'm in the USA with typical USA health care, if that helps the answers."
keto,What is the secret to keto breading?,"I attempted to make keto-friendly calamari last night and the results were disappointing because my breading did not stick to the squid. I used a [breading recipe I found on Food Network](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/keto-breaded-chicken-cutlets-5511768), which called for 2 cups of almond flour mixed with 1/2 cup parmesan cheese. It seems like every time I attempt a breading recipe with almond flour, the breading does not stick to the protein. Has anyone mastered the art of keto breading? I'm willing to try pan-frying or roasting in the oven, but I'm not willing to deep-fry. I'm not sure if I'm working with the wrong ingredients or if I'm doing something wrong in my methods (not using enough oil, incorrect oven temperature). Any guidance would be most appreciated."
keto,What’s your favorite sugar alternative and brand of choice? (NOT erythritol pls),"Thinking of trying stevia or monk fruit extract. What brands do you guys recommend that isn’t mixed with erythritol? Causes MEGA stomach upset for me.

Are there any other sugar alternatives you prefer? If so, what brand?

Aftertaste seems to be a common issue in sweeteners along with GI upset so looking for recommendations.

keto,Whole pack of bacon...,"Anybody ever just fry up a whole pack of bacon? (1 pound, 16 slices)

This isn't my first time but I just want to make sure I'm not a freak! I've done it with cheese and tabasco. Fills you up for so long.

Today, I'm thinking a whole pack with some eggs and that will easily do me until dinner."
keto,Taste Changes,"Has anyone discovered taste changes in ketosis? 
For the first time in my life I started craving black coffee. Never ever had that..so I add my shot of  MCT oil and good to go. This is unusual for me as before I got into ketosis I always had a little cream and sugar.
In ketosis I turned to my Bullet Proof coffees..enjoyed them..but recently I crave only black coffee like it's going out of style.  
Also never really liked eggs as I would feel rather I'll for an hour after eating an egg, now I look forward to eggs..how odd."

keto,Can’t decide if I should wait it out or try something new...,"F(38) - SW: 280, CW: 228, GW: 180.  Started keto at the suggestion of my doctor a year ago (February 2020). Have to say I LOVE it.  I had been intermittent fasting (18/6 - 20/4 daily) for at least 10 years prior to starting and I never experienced the “keto flu”. I immediately had more energy and lost that sluggish just want to sit and do nothing feeling.  I walk 3-5 miles a day.  In 2019 I herniated 3 discs in my back and knew I needed to lose the weight if I ever wanted a chance at being pain free and able to play with my kid and dogs.  I have always been active (two husky household means lots of walks) but I needed to address the weight. Doctor suggested keto and after assuring me she would stay on top of my cholesterol (entire family has cholesterol issues, I am the only one not on medicine) she convinced me to give it a go.  I love it, I really really do.  But I have been stuck for about 4 months now.  I will lose and regain the same 5-10 pounds.  I know I am the cause for some of it, my doc told me to give myself a break around the holidays and I might have over done it.  But I haven’t seen any movement in scale, the ways clothes fit, or tape measure in a while. I know it was easy to lose in the beginning because I have a lot to lose. I also know plateaus happen - and i experienced the 2-3 weeks of nothingness before something finally gave.  But it has been months and now I am contemplating shaking things up.  Should I switch out to a Mediterranean (husband has heart disease and was doing keto - successfully I might add and loving it - until his new cardiologist basically told him he might as well just drop dead now if that is how he is going to eat). They want him to Mediterranean diet it... he hasn’t switched over yet but he has hit the same plateau as I have and hasn’t really moved for 3-4 months so he was going to switch come March. I can’t decide if I should attempt a switch with him or if I should stick it out. I don’t want to give it up - I have a fair amount of hormone/autoimmune issues and I have to say keto is the best I have felt with them all in my adult life! Any advice would be helpful!

TL/DR: Stuck for 3ish months (though with a significant “cheat” in December) and can’t decide if I should walk away for a month to shake things up or stick it out."
keto,Question about Keto Calculator: Lean weight or total weight?,"So in trying to use the Keto Calculator I've learned the following things.

1. The FAQ says that the calculator wants your Lean Body Mass for the Weight field, and if you click on Expert mode you can also enter your Body Fat Percentage.
2. I also saw that the calculator estimates your Body Fat% in the panel on the right, which makes it *seem* like it's already accounting for that when you put in your total weight.
3. The Weight Forecast definitely isn't accounting for Body Fat% at all because it only shows your projected weight loss based on what you put in the Weight field.  That's strange because we're not trying to lose Lean Body Mass, so why would it be projecting weight loss in that way if it expects you to enter lean weight.
4. Trying to keep up with the protein goal the calculator gave me when I just put in my total body weight seems a bit much.  20 eggs per day or 5 scoops of protein powder seems like something a high end body builder would be doing.  I find it hard to believe that my daily walks are scraping that much protein off my bones.  I have set the protein ratio to 0.8 as the FAQ suggests, that didn't change anything so I'm guessing the calculator defaults to that anyway.

The results it gives me when I put in lean mass:

60g protein  
15g carbs  
52g fat

The results it gives me when I put in total body weight:

112g protein  
24g carbs  
76g fat

In both cases I have 47 in body fat and 0.8 in protein, and have set the activity to walking.

So, the question is: What do I put into the Weight field?  My total weight, or my lean weight?  Putting in lean weight gives much more reasonable results for the goals and limits considering I'm not training for world's strongest man.  It also doesn't line up with what I've read from other sources about daily protein requirements on keto for an average non-superhero fellow such as myself, but I want to be sure I'm using the right ones."
keto,Keto for 2 months and Very High Cholesterol,"I just got my exam results from the doctor. Very high levels of LDL and NonHDL. The results claim I am very high at risk for cardiovascular issues.

HDL - 53 mg/dl
LDL - 216 mg/dl
Non HDL - 230 mg/dl
Total - 283 mg/dl
Total/HDL - 5.3
Triglycerides- 71 mg/dl

Is this reason for true concern? Is this a failure of the diet or the result of “dirty keto”? I consume higher than suggested levels of saturated fats (butter, cheese, heavy cream, bacon, etc.) so maybe it’s just that?"
keto,I forgot how amazing I feel on Keto.,"I started keto back in 2014 when it was still super taboo. I lost around 90 pounds over the course of 3 years on the diet. I've maintained the loss plus or minus ~5 pounds over the years with a combo of low-ish carb and mostly just CICO. 

Lately, I've been feeling pretty sluggish due to a breakup and some seasonal depression, and I decided to give keto another real try because I remembered feeling so great in general when I was more strict. I've ""tried"" getting back to keto again a few times over the years, but never really made it over the initial hump of feeling like crap for a bit and then getting fat adapted. I also randomly got a horrible keto rash on one of these re-tries that scared me away for awhile because I had never had it before in all the years of keto-ing I'd done.

BUT OH MY GOSH, I must have totally forgotten exactly how awesome I feel when I get into a good keto flow! I'm on day 8, and the past week I was feeling a little bit of keto flu, but today I woke up feeling so energetic and motivated and alive, and I know it's keto because THIS is the feeling I remember. I'm looking forward to keeping up with it, this time more for my mental health than for weight loss. But I would love to finally lose the extra 20 as well!

I'm also amazed at how much traction keto has gained in the last few years, and I love that I can now go to the grocery store and find bread, cookies, and pretty much any food I can imagine in a keto version and most of the time it tastes pretty good. I know some of you are purists, but I'm totally not and never have been haha. I'll live on Coke Zero and Quest cookies if I want to, it still freaking works. I'm glad to be back!"
keto,My Journey So Far,"M(29) - SW: 205lb, GW: 170lb

Began the journey on January 4th after pigging out on everything i thought might miss after starting keto.

So far, I dont miss much of what I ""cant"" eat. Can't is in quotations, because I can still eat most of the things I ate before. I just have to make adjustments, but Blaze pizza has been great for that cravings, wings are amazing for spending time with my pizza loving family, jimmy johns unwiches make quick pickup food easy.

I decided to post because I finally hit that stall and thought I could use some of the positivity y'all share. I'm stalled at 184lbs!!! So I am still incredibly happy. 14 lbs to go.

I started out by meticulously racking everything! I wouldn't add an ingredient without logging it, including spices at first! Two weeks in, I felt good about loosening up, but still weighing major portions. After a week more, I stopped really tracking anything, except mentally making sure carbs were under 20g. I may have gone to 25g on days where I was eating wings and drinking low carb beer with my dad.

Here is why I think I've stalled:

1. I need to recalculate macros.

2. I need to track, at least loosely, for a week or two to get my eyes and mind back on track.

3. I discovered keto ice cream... while it stops me from going over on carbs... my calories are a bit high on the weekends lol... I need to stop that for a bit. Maybe just a couple bites.

I also do intermittent fasting with it. I only eat between 12 and 8. That is somewhat loose. If I'm hungry sooner I might eat at 11 or if not hungry I'll just start picking as I get hungry in the afternoon. Sometimes I might eat a bit later in the evening like 9 MAYBE 10 if one of those nights with my dad. 

So far it's been amazing! Easy to stick to and losing tons of weight. I haven't noticed any of the other benefits people talk about though. Maybe a bit of clarity from less alcohol. Better sleep, again probably due to less alcohol."
keto,Is there an App or website to determine if a product is keto or not?,"I searched for an app in Play Store and did not find much of relevant results. Most of what I found are meals or keto trackers. 

What I am searching exactly for is an application or a website that determines whether the product that I scanned using its commercial barcode is keto or not. Giving details about the carbs, fibers and Glycemic Index is a recommended bonus.

So, if anyone knows an application or a website, I would appreciate it if they could share it.

Regards and many thanks."
keto,Keto for two weeks and hardly any weight loss,"Hi all - thanks for this amazing sub and your knowledge.

I've been on keto for two weeks and have struggled a little (I've had two cheat days) however have stuck with it.

I am a guy, 6'1 and weighing 110kg and want to get down to at least 85kg however nothing seems to be happening. I have lost a total of 0.4kg in two weeks. 

My calories intake is limited to 1650 but there has been one or two days where it has been a little more. 

I walk 3/4 times a week for 3 miles and will go back to the gyms when they open.

My intake (goals from the macro calculator from the FAQ) was C: &lt;25g (but yesterday was around 50 as I had a bit of chocolate), P: 133g (which I have consistently gone above besides one day) and F: 121g (which I have always been below since I tracked)

What am I doing wrong? Are my cals too high? The cheat days? Should I be stricter and permit no cheat days in order to see results? Sorry if I am asking stupid questions."
keto,Nutrition info with oil,I've been on keto for a while as a truck driver and something came to mind. I get some canned meat for when I don't have time to cook.

keto,Calculating Nutritional Info,Is there an easy way to figure out nutritional info on homemade Greek yogurt? I know the milk I started with and the active culture starter - but the brewing process is supposed to burn off carbs the longer it brews. I have an old batch in my freezer I’d love to use for a smoothie but I’m hesitant because I don’t know how much I could get away with. Left the title vague in case there are other foods this could apply to that are less situational. How do you calculate food when eating at someone else’s house? I mean I would choose the items I know are safe (like just have the patty no bun for a hamburger) etc. I guess I’m looking for a general rule of thumb and then also Greek yogurt specific?
keto,Keto So Far...,"I have struggled with weight all my life, like many people do.  I was a 135 lb 10 year old!  At various points in my adult life I’ve binged and sat my way to 260 (I’m 5’7”), and at others I’ve starved and cardiod my way to as low as 198.  

I have willpower, but thought I lacked impulse control.  I can easily just not eat if I want to lose weight, but when I have tried to “just eat and exercise like a normal person”, I inevitably gain weight, because a “normal meal” just didn’t hack it for me; I would be hungry again 2 hours later.  

In 2018 I got serious about lifting weights and running, but by the end of 2020 I found myself at 257 lbs anyway.  Strong, but fat, around 31% body fat.

Starting January 1st (“New Year, New Me!”) I decided to try Keto, because...Tim Ferris, mostly.  

The first week sucked.  I was tired, irritable, my gym performance went through the floor, and I didn’t enjoy it.  I did lose 7 lbs of water weight, and that was enough to get me to week 2.

But more than dropping water weight, one other thing happened that got me to the second week:  I was sleeping!  I have had insomnia forever, I could go a day or two without sleep, and when I did sleep it was for 3-4 hours, tops.  I made it through my day on (usually highly sugared) coffee, Monster, phentermine, or whatever else might allow me to do my job and be part of the world without sleep.  On my 4th day of Keto, though, I slept 7 hours.  The 5th, 6th, and 7th nights were like that, too.  

So, with 7 pounds of weight loss and 3 days of sleep, I moved forward.  At the end of January I was getting Blood ketone readings as high as 1.  I had lost 17 lbs.  Every night I go to sleep between 9:00 and 10:00, and don’t wake up until 3:30-5:00 (I don’t need an alarm clock, I just wake up naturally).  Definitely enough progress to see me in to month 2.

Throughout February I’ve continued to see results. Currently I’m 224.4, 26.1% body fat.  My lifts at the gym are back up to my carb burning PRs, and my running/cardio days are MUCH better than before from a standpoint of endurance and recovery.

**personal stuff that may make you uncomfortable**

A few things nobody told me would happen, but which are worth the price of admission:  I used to get up often at night to pee.  I never do anymore, that stopped the first week.  That’s amazing.  I used to get terrible cravings in the middle of the night; I would sometimes eat 5-600 calories in the middle of the night. That ended basically immediately.  I was having problems getting/maintaining an erection; after about 3 weeks, that issue resolved itself (I’m not actually sure how happy my wife of 25 years is about that, :) ).  My mood is so much more even and generally “better”, which may be because I sleep so darn good and regularly now.  

**out of the woods**

This is honestly amazing.  I don’t crave anything, good or bad.  I just get hungry when it’s time to.  My joints feel better, I’m stronger, my muscles are getting definition.  I can focus better, for longer periods.  

And, it’s easy AF.  I don’t count calories, I just eat regularly and we’ll.  People scared me a lot, initially, about taking too much protein to support weight lifting goals, but that hasn’t turned out to be a problem for me (I end up doing about 40% protein, 50% fat, 10% carbs).  I can go out, I just have to avoid the carbs.  I can drink whiskey (!).  

I intended to do Keto for 3 months to get to my annual “looking pretty good” phase, before I proceeded to my annual “getting ready for winter” gnarly fat phase.  Turns out, though, that I don’t want to go back.  I don’t want McDonalds and baked potatoes and milk shakes, and cereal (God, I love cereal).  That stuff wasn’t just putting weight on me, it was making me sick and miserable.  I have started thinking of it simply like “I am allergic to carbs, so I can’t have them”, and I believe that’s close to true, I do feel like I have an allergic reaction to carbs that makes me sick when I have them.  So, it’s easy not to want them.

I sincerely hope that everyone who needs to discovers Keto.  The community is great, the results are wonderful, it’s not difficult, and I think it will change many lives for the better.  At 42, I finally feel like I understand my body, and am developing a healthy relationship to food (in that, I don’t really think about food, much, anymore)."
keto,Greasy hair and face during keto,"Hi! So I've started following the keto diet a week ago. One thing I noticed (besides less migraine already) is that my hair and face is more greasy. 

I already had to wash my hair everyday before keto. But now it gets greasy within just a few hours. It doesn't help that I have seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp and face, which is linked to sebum production. 

It surprises me, because I've read studies that link less carbohydrates to a decrease in sebum production.

But I've seen a few posts on here from people who had the same experience. So I'm wondering if it went back to normal for them eventually. And how long it took.

TLDR: Hair and face is more greasy while doing keto. Is this forever or will it go back to normal? Thanks!"
keto,Cravings,"I’m starting the keto diet tomorrow. The one big question on my mind is: for the most part, are cravings mostly a non-issue in comparison to other diets?.. once you get through the keto flu anyways.

Can anybody speak on whether that has been an issue for them on keto?"

I am on a medication that is know to increase blood sugar. When I check for ketones in my urine I either have none or trace amounts. If I continue to take this medication, is there still a way to go into ketosis?"
keto,Unhealthy cycle of self sabotaging,"Hi, i’m 18 years old, and i’m female. I am currently overweight, i would like to do ketosis to lose all the extra weight, and i have, but somedays i fuck up and eat bad food. Here’s how my cycle goes: I eat healthy for 6 days, take a test, it says i’m in ketosis, i’m happy, then the next day, it’s someone’s birthday in my household. so, i eat whatever we have for dinner and eat the cake my mom made to please her and because i don’t really care, it’s a special day right?! here’s another example: the day after the birthday, i eat completely keto. eggs, a bit of bacon and blah blah blah for lunch and dinner. i do that same thing for 8 days. i take a test, i’m in keto. the next day, it’s a holiday or family tradition.. with all sorts of unhealthy foods and sugar. i eat it because it’s a family reunion and i do not care. i hate that i do that. i self sabotage and i hate it. i don’t know why. it makes me hate myself and it kinda makes me want to cry. i know what i can do. when i was only 17, i lost 50 pounds easily. no cheat days. i sticked to keto every damn day, but right now, one day i’m doing so good on keto, staying under 15 carbs, no sugar at all, under twelve hundred calories and the next day i fuck up and then have to wait 6 days to get back into keto because i JuSt HAd To eAt That but did i really? No. does anyone have any tips i can use to stop doing that shit? how to stay away from the bad foods my family eats?"
keto,Lost a bunch of weight but never get in shape.,"I love Keto - to start with that, lost 70lbs after my second Child. I was 141 lbs at 5.10 (thanks to the Pandemic back to 149) but although i worked out and ran i never felt like i look good. 
I always have those Thunderthighs and when i wear a Jacket still look overweight. 
My Doctor said that he thinks i‘m at a perfect weight but i just don’t feel it and i‘m unhappy about my appearance. 
Is there anything i can do to slim down my legs without loosing more of my „female attributes“?"
keto,Adding weight lifting while on keto?,"Hello, before the pandemic I was a pretty active weight lifter. Nothing too serious, just three days a week alternating through a series of free weights and I really enjoyed it. Obviously that went out the window and I've put on weight during lockdown. I started strict keto two months ago and I feel great. I love this diet and I'm finding all kinds of creative ideas on this sub and others. I recently got my last COVID shot and I'd like to start going back to the gym. My only concern is having the strength and energy to lift weights. I know im no where near where I was after a year indoors and I also know that a lot of energy for weight lifting comes from carbs. Is there anyone who can give me some tips on how to get back into weights and if there's anything that will help? Thank you for being an amazing and supportive sub!"
keto,Chicken ... What's the deal?,"I had a day where I only ate chicken. Lots of it. I did lazy keto, the next day I weighed my self and I gained almost 7 pounds. It's been about 2 days and I haven't adjusted. 

So, why should eating chicken do this to me or anyone else?"
keto,I can’t see the change,"I’ve lost 70 pounds so far. I tried keto in 2017 when I’d gotten up 247 pounds. Knowing what I know now, I was just limiting carbs, it wasn’t really keto and I was riding stationary bike everyday. I lost about 20 pounds. I was so pleased with myself that I’d hit a mark in my mind and said “Hooray I’ve lost 20 pounds!” and ate myself all the way up to 294 by September 2020. 

This time I’m actually doing keto and I’m living the keto lifestyle and will continue to do so, but not just for the weight loss. I have had horrible IBS my entire life and I will be okay with never eating pasta or cakes and cookies since I’m no longer chained to the toilet. 

Anyway, I look in the mirror now and all I see is the same old me in the mirror. I know what the scale says but it’s not getting through to my brain and I don’t know how to fix it. 

I’ve taken pictures along the way so I’d have proof that I was actually losing weight but they don’t look like what I had in my mind 70 pounds gone would look like. When folks post their face gains or the full body before and after pics here I’m so amazed at the difference I see in everyone else. 

I know about body dysmorphia but I think I have the reverse, I thought I was lucky that I was able to carry the weight so well surely no one notices. Even up to the day at the doctors office when I weighed in at 294 I was still able to lie to myself.

I wish I was exaggerating but I’m not. I truly thought that because I was wearing ridiculously expensive plus size tops from online boutiques no one would notice how I’d gained “a little bit of weight”.

Now that I’m close to the weight I was back in 2017, I only see the 294 pound me. Even with pictures I just don’t see a change. Am I broken? Has anyone else felt this way and if so how did you get past this?"
keto,Is this keeping me out if ketosis.,"Hello all. Been doing keto since Sept and initially lost 20 lbs in the first 3 months. Now I seem to be gaining especially in my stomach.

I eat 1 of these a night. I justify it becuase the net carbs aren't bad. Is this crushing my ketosis? It's the only thing I can think of. (Here's two links to images of the keto ice cream)

keto,I’m 5 days in and I’m feeling really full all the time which is something I didn’t expect. I’m hardly ever hungry except in the morning.,Do you all feel the same? I’m just really curious about this because I expected to miss carbs and feel hungry after I ate a meal with no carbs. I don’t know anyone who has done Keto so i need answers lol. I  haven’t really been hungry except in the morning.
keto,"Man, keto has been the only diet that has actually worked for me","In October 2019 I decided to make a change for myself. I was SW: 240lbs (20M - 5’8”), lost the love of my life, and was insanely depressed. I started to buy healthier food, track my calories, and ate at a deficit. Over the course of 2 months, I lost about 10 pounds. Don’t get me wrong, that’s fantastic, and I was learning my way around the kitchen/grocery store during that time. But I knew I was doing something kinda wrong. I fluctuated weight every couple days. I would gain 2 days in a row, and then drop the next day or 2. It was very unmotivating. After Christmas 2019 I came across keto, and it changed my life. 

From December 2019 to March 2020, I had dropped 35lbs. I was 195, and then the pandemic hit. Keto took a backseat, I focused more on mental health and life, and didn’t pay much attention to numbers. Around June 2020 I started to pick things back up again, and was happy to see I didn’t lose much, if any ground on my weight loss. I had reached my goal of 180 on July 20th 2020. At that point I got content, which I regret doing. I was happy to have finally reached my long-term goal, but forgetting the fact that I was still over weight. I had originally set this goal because it was the last number on the scale the last time I was weighed my freshman year of high school. 

From July-December 2020 I didn’t keep track of much. But at the beginning of December I had reweighed myself to see I had went back up to 195. I didn’t enjoy keto, I hated the limitations it gave me and honestly it can get kind of expensive (broke ass college student here). I didn’t notice any positive side effects like being more energetic or anything like that. I actually felt nauseous, dizzy and had a lot of headaches through it all, and I even passed out in the shower once during keto. But it was working. It was shedding off the weight. In December I tried to start just a caloric deficit again, mixed with some cardio and weight training, and just like the last time the weight fell off insanely slow. Sometimes I would be stuck at a plateau for a week. 

About a week ago, I restarted keto, and this time I will reach my new goal of 160, no matter how long it takes. Within the week, I have lost 5lbs, and am now extremely motivated to keep pushing as hard as I can to better my life. I look forward to reaching a life of regular, moderated eating habits. I appreciate keto, but it is not a lifestyle in which I would want to do for the rest of my life. It’s a diet to me, and it works wonders in that sense."
keto,Has anyone tried Slimquick Keto pills?,"Hello! The other day at Costco they had the Slimquick Keto pills on sale, so I bought it and I have been taking the 6 pills a day BUT I now have gained 5 pounds!?! Has anyone else tried these? I have been doing keto a while and the only change is the pills.

Thanks in advance!!"
keto,Starting my final push....,"Hi everyone. It's been a while. 

I started keto in August 2019 and, over the course of the year lost 140 pounds, from 284 down to 142. Then I stopped, 17 pounds from my goal, not ""overweight"" or obese for the first time in my adult life. 

This past July my mother died after a painful struggle with pancreatic cancer. Even though she'd been ill for two years, I wasn't ready to lose her, maybe we're never ready to lose our moms. The combination of my own grief and the stress of supporting my dad through his loss made me back away from tracking my food (which I'd done religiously) and eating at a deficit. I didn't comfort myself with carbs which was my previous MO, but probably ate 50 or so a day. Whatever I was doing was sort of beyond lazy keto (maybe ""super lazy keto""?). I did keep exercising and weighing myself every morning and tracking my weight in my health app. If the scale had me at 145 I'd be careful for a couple of days until I got back to 141 or 142 but that was all. 

Two weeks ago I had to be in the hospital for a few days following surgery eating a clear liquid diet. When I go home my weight was 155. I knew of course I hadn't gained 15 pounds in 3 days on broth and sugar-free jello -- that this was fluid retention after three days of IV fluid. Sure enough, over the past couple weeks, my weight has gone back to 141. 

It's had an effect though. Watching the scale move down made me realize I want to lose this last 11 pounds and be done with losing weight or thinking about losing weight. I want to see what that feels like. This would be something entirely novel in my life. As long as I've been conscious I weighed something, probably starting when I was eleven or so, I've thought or been told I needed to lose a little weight. As a teenager, I had a distorted view of that 10-15 pounds. I look at pictures of myself from high school when weighed 130 (my current goal weight). Back then I ran 5 miles a day, wore a size 8, and still thought I needed to be thinner. Rather than getting thinner through, I dieted my way to super morbid obesity. My highest weight was 387 about 12 years ago. After bariatric surgery, I lost down to 160 and then slowly regained until I started keto at 284. 

At 53 I'd like to reclaim the mental space I've given over to losing weight my entire life. I want to focus on maintaining, on being healthy, on being active, and aging well. I started my last push yesterday. I feel relieved."
keto,Is it safe to up your carbs a bit on days you workout?,"I've never done this intentionally. However, I just came back for a very intensive crossfit workout and I was super hungry. My wife had made lightly breaded, air fried chicken for dinner and forgot to make me a grilled piece. I just ate what she made. Didn't want to make a big deal out of it  Especially considering she cooks for me all the time and I've never once asked her to. Now I'm feeling a bit guilty and I'm wondering if there's a chance I've thrown myself off ketosis. I generally keep my net carbs around 20 per day and have been in ketosis for almost 2 months and lost 15 lbs if that's any help. Thanks!"
keto,Celebrate my progress and I have a question,"I've been on keto for a couple months now. I'm down 20+ lb. Down from around 250. Trying to get into the low 200s. It's been relatively easy. I'm almost never hungry. Weight came off quick the first few weeks. Lately it's slowed down but I'm ok with that. Hoping to hit the goal weight over the summer. I still have a ways to go. 

My question. I'm partial to a good latte in the morning. No sweeteners. Just straight milk and espresso. I've been drinking at least one every day since I started on keto. As my weight loss has slowed down I tried to pay a little closer attention to what's going in. While it sounds like whole dairy is ok, the 8oz of milk in my latte are contributing significant carbs. I've tried a few milk alternatives but they're not very good. Am I bound to drink americanos or drip coffee? Any espresso lovers here that can help me out?"
keto,"Hi, Does anyone have experience with the brand Dymatize for Protein Powder?","Hey all -

I have been using Isopure (2 scoops) in the morning, of various flavors to help meet my protein macro daily for about a month now. I am not really tired of the flavors I have, but came across a brand called Dymatize that makes 1G carb protein powder of the ""pebbles"" cereals, both fruity and cocoa. These were my favorite when I was a kid and they seemed reasonably priced on amazon so just wanted to see if anyone had experience with these flavors, or this brand in particular before buying.

keto,Starting keto. Wild lipid numbers though.,"I started eating keto(ish) this week and had bloodwork done to see where things are. (My wife and I are jumping in with both feet on Monday because my mom is traveling to see us for my birthday this weekend.) 

A little background, I have always had some high triglycerides. Genetics I guess. I’m 6’1 205. About 15% body fat. I ran my 2nd marathon a week ago. Running between 30-40 miles a week right now with some strength stuff mixed in on occasion. 

Lab Numbers as follows: cholesterol 256, Trig 1,441, HDL and LDL were normal. A1c was 5.7. Was fasting for 14 hours at the time of the blood draw. 

I’m anxious to see what my numbers do once I get into keto. Anyone have any experience with similar numbers?"
keto,"For those of you who have done this longterm, how do you keep keto fresh?","Hello fellow people of reddit, here's hoping I don't get stoned to death by asking the question.

I'll start this post off with a little bit of a story, I've been on keto for roughly 6-7 months. I started at 110kg (242lbs) and am now half a pound away from the fabled ""onederland"", at 6'5"", which I hope to get to by the end of the month/the first week of March. I also went down from 2XL to L in size, so I'm by no mean saying keto doesn't work or that I want to quit. I've never had any digestive problems, blood pressure/sugar problems, or any other kind of issue keto could fix, so the one and only goal for me was to lose weight and keep it off longterm.   
The main issue I am running into right now is just the food becoming stale. When I started, keto for me meant ""eggs and bacon, nuts and cheese"", thankfully, I've soon started looking up recipes on the internet, but as time went on, the recipes became just variations of the same thing.  
Want to bake and need a flour substitute? Fathead dough for you. Want to have keto-friendly sweets? Either load it with chocolate or hope you like pumpkin flavour. Every other popular keto recipe is some kind of casserole, involving some kind of a mixture of ground beef, cabbage/cauliflower, cheese, and eggs. Want something special? Buy these five random, expensive ingredients that might or might not even be available outside of America.   
Browsing this and other keto focused subreddits, I've noticed that the kind of trend on sites like these is to post progress pics after a couple of weeks, sometimes a month or two. There is the occasional ""I've lost X amount of weight in a 1/2/3 years,"" but, at least from the posts I've read, these people usually started keto in the middle of losing weight, after they'd hit some kind of a plateau. So it got me thinking if the people who do keto as a lifestyle just don't need to talk/post about it because they've achieved their goals and it's just a part of who they are now, or are people simply treating keto as a sort of ""get skinny quick"" quasi-fad diet.   


Really, I just want to know, if there are people that have done this for any long period of time (more than a couple of months), how did you keep your diet fresh? And if you stopped, what was the reason? I am not really looking for recipes per se, I could probably just dig deeper on the internet and find some I haven't tried yet, but if you have any kind of wonderfood that has freshened up your cuisine (as long as it's not cabbage), I'd be glad to hear it."
keto,How much salt do you consume?,"I am new to Keto and the salt being bad for you in high amounts thing is still in my head.

keto,"I'm a bit confused about electrolytes, micronutrients, RDA/DRI and body size and cronometer.","I'm really small and when I look at the RDA/DRI for most vitamins and minerals there is no way I could eat the amount of food needed to get enough.  I'm guessing I can just reduce them, probably in half, given that  I think those are set for people eating 2000 kcal/day?

But for K and Na its even more difficult to get enough from food and the amounts I see on cronometer are quite a bit different than what is listed in the FAQ.  The FAQ says: 5000 mg of sodium and 1000 mg of potassium.  Cronometer says 1500 mg of sodium and 2600 mg of potassium.

I especially don't see how I could get those from food.  Can electrolytes be scaled down due to size also?

(I'm taking a Mg supplement and probably get enough Ca from dairy. )

It makes me a bit nervous that the FAQ says: ""Remember that taking too much potassium or sodium at once can be dangerous"", I don't want to take too much either.  I have no idea how much I need."
keto,"2 months in, still no mental benifts","Heyo, I'm down almost 25lbs and I'm NOT suffering on keto. I absolutely love it honestly, but I'm not getting any of the mental benifts I was hoping for. (Yet) I'm still very tired and groggy. I've been doing my best to supplement my electrolytes in case that's the problem, I bought nosalt, I salt my food, I even bought electrolyte drops and a Magniseum supplement. I'm also hypothyroid and I'm thinking it could be related so I got some bloodwork done yesterday and an dr appointment next week. I got my parents on board and they say they're experiencing the benifts I'm hoping for, more energy and mental clarity. I've still been kinda down in the dumps depressed and anxious, losing weight however, and not quitting but I'm just kind of jealous I'm not getting the mental benifts which is almost the exact reason I chose keto which was weightloss AND mental benifts. I don't know I just kinda feel like I'm not getting anywhere mentally. I'm not going anywhere I'm just trying to figure out what else I can do. Thanks!

keto,Keto for 1 week,"Hi everyone! Before I ask for help I’d like to mention I’ve lost weight the “traditional” way before. Well balanced meal &amp; working out. I’d lost 30 pounds. Covid &amp; Stress I regained. 

In Jan I started back with my routine and I was 10lbs down before I started Keto. I’ve been on Keto for a week with no change in weight. I’m having trouble understanding the learning curve to this. To stay in a calorie limit, when a lot of “fat” foods I find are calories dense, on top of consuming protein.

I am currently on a meal plan recommended by friends &amp; family, so I don’t have specific measurements on what I’m eating. But perhaps some of you can recommend where I might be going wrong or tips to stay in your limit and hit your goals?

My stats are: CW 188, 5’6, 22F according to the calculator I should be consuming: 97G protein 23 Crabs (I thought we should stay at 20) and 104 Fat / 1409 calories"

keto,"38 days on Keto, suddenly losing ketosis?","Hi all! As the title suggests, today is my 38th day on keto and up until two days ago, I felt like I was doing great. I felt better, more focused, better mood, less stomach issues. And it's been very easy for me to stick to the low carb count.

My weight loss hasn't been significant besides the initial water weight drop, but just before the 5 week mark, I did see some changes and weight dropping. However, suddenly, I gained a pound back and when I measured my ketones, it was near 0 (truthfully my measurement system isn't fabulous - the colors are hard to read). I haven't changed anything about my eating habits, so I have no idea what might have either knocked me out of ketosis or has put me on the brink of it. As of today, I gained yet another pound and the measurements seem again near 0. 

Has this happened to anyone -- dropping or nearly dropping out of ketosis for no apparent reason? I don't plan on stopping, but it's hitting me really hard right now. For reference if it's important, I'm a 34 year old woman."
keto,Developing Lactose Intolerance (Warning: GI Distress Issues),"Hello all. I wanted to reach out to discuss something that happened to me this week. Been keto for about a decade, and until very recently I allowed some dairy into my diet from time to time with the exception of half &amp; half in my morning coffee. I used some cheese, full fat greek yogurt, and cottage cheese now and then. I noticed a month ago the yogurt was giving me a little gas, but nothing terrible. I read that the cultures in yogurt digests most of the lactose (milk sugar) so it isn't usually a problem for people on keto diets. 

Fast forward to this past Monday, I felt like some 4% milk-fat cottage cheese with berries for lunch. Later that day I was blessed with ungodly flatulence that lasted overnight, followed by GI/stomach pain, diarrhea, and general GI distress that I am still experiencing. I also read that as people age, their bodies lose lactase which digests lactose, which leads to lactose intolerance. 

I am curious if anyone else has experienced this. I've eaten dairy most of my life and never experienced this level of pain and discomfort from it. Looks like I am going to have to cut dairy out of my diet. 

TIA"
keto,Friendly reminder: Keto is the simplest diet in the world but just because it is simple doesn't mean it is easy.,"What do I mean that keto is the simplest diet in the world?  All I mean is that we really only limit the consumption of one thing: sugar molecules.  Stitch them together and call them starch or have them all separate and call them sugars it doesn't matter.  You can do a carnivorous diet, a vegan diet, a pescetarian diet, a mediterranean diet, and anything else and call it keto.  You can eat food from every corner of the globe.  You can eat 5 meals a day or 2 meals a week.  It is still keto.  If you are in ketosis it is keto.

We see some amazing stories on here about people overcoming a lifelong food addiction that puts them at 400 or 500 pounds and after trying everything else discovering that keto is all they can stick to and that's really incredible.

Eat food, just don't eat the carbs.  Simple.

But DO NOT confuse simple with easy!

How do you quit cigarettes?  Just stop smoking.  How do you cure alcoholism?  Just stop drinking.

Food, especially but not exclusively carbs, is the most abused drug in the world.  And in this context I'll draw the line between food and drug as food being something consumed to make you healthy and fuel your body while a drug being something potentially harmful consumed to give a particular effect.

Don't tell me oreos are food, they are a drug.

This is where simple and easy become very different things.  For so many of us every happy moment of our life was celebrated with a great feast and every sad moment was buried under a pile of junk food.  It is a coping mechanism and frankly an effective one.  Remove binge eating and carb debauchery from your arsenal, what are you left with?  Is it nothing?  That's a hard place to be when something does go wrong.

A story for you

Some years ago I had gotten down to my lowest adult weight ever.  I was a healthy BMI for the first time since I was 12.  Very soon afterward a number of factors in my life collapsed leading me to a very deep depression.  Over the course of one month I gained over 30 pounds. I kept telling myself that I would start back on keto that morning but on the way home from work I'd keep finding myself at the store picking up the treats that I loved as a child.  Oreo cookies, EL Fudges, ice cream.  I drink alcohol but this was never my vice, food was and I threw away years of hard work trying to fill an emotional hole with sugar.

Any of this sound familiar?

It's not an uncommon story.

keto,Please help me troubleshoot issues with electrolytes,"Hi. I'm 21m, 67kg/182cm, on my fourth week of clean keto for long-term health and productivity. The problem is, most of the time I feel like shit, but at rare occasions I feel really good. 

I'm tracking my electrolytes and my water intake: 5000/1000/600mg of sodium, potassium and magnesium + 2l of water per day.

Symptoms: fatigue, brain fog, problems thinking, tingling and sometimes numbness in hands, heavy legs. Blood pressure and heart rate: 110/60/55.

This all sound like sodium deficiency, but I'm struggling to find a balance. Sometimes I feel very thirsty, but it immediately gets worse, if I drink more water. So I'm afraid of drinking more water, cause it might flush my electrolytes, and I'm afraid of taking more sodium, cause it might pull water from tissues and make everything worse.

Also, it feels like roller coaster: sometimes drinking water makes me feel better, sometimes - worse. Same with salty water or bullion.

 So, what do I do? I'd be very glad to hear your advices"
keto,Do I need to keep eating to reach my macros even if I'm not hungry?,"I have a protein shake in the morning because I can't really stomach a heavy breakfast.

keto,Weight Loss/Keto Help,"Weight Loss Help. SW: 290 CW:265 GW:190-200


So I started Keto on the first week of November 2020 at 290. As the months went on, I gradually started losing weight to the point that I am currently at 265 pounds. Yes, I did cheat for the holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, &amp; New Years). Now my problem is that I feel like from November up until now, I should still be losing weight but I am stuck at 265 and been stuck at this weight for almost a month. 3 weeks ago, I started going to the gym 3 days a week doing the treadmill for 30 minutes and the elliptical for 30 minutes. After that, I would do weight machines (for the abs and chest). Still, I am stuck at 265. I am getting frustrated that I am not losing anymore weight. I also started intermittent fasting 2 weeks ago. Still no progress. Any tips to get out of this plateau? I’m trying to at least be to 200 by August but I am very stuck! Please help."
keto,Lost 5.5lbs but gained Inches?,"Hello all, I started Keto on the 22nd February and weighed myself this morning out of curiosity (I’m meant to weigh myself this Saturday) and found that I’m down 5.5lbs, which I’m absolutely delighted with. I decided then to see if my measurements had changed, even if just a tiny bit but found that none have gone down and some have gone up a little. I’m a bit confused! 

I did the macro calculator and these are the ones I’ve been following:

172g Fat
158g Protein
20g Carbs

I had it set that my Body Fat is at 29% (according to an internet calculator) and my BMI at 38.9 

I was 278.4lbs when I started on the 22nd and have always managed to keep just under my macros. I’m 34, female and am 5”11 tall.

I’m also taking a Multivitamin and drinking a litre of water a day. I haven’t started exercise yet though and I’m not due my monthlies.

I use Pink Himalayan salt in my cooking. 

Can anyone see where I am going wrong? 

Thank you in advance :)

keto,Tip of My Tongue / Memory Issues,"Hey r/keto

I am a big fan of keto - about a year and a half ago I used it to drop \~20 pounds and get into a healthier weight (175-155). I'm not a super overweight guy, and am somewhat active/athletic (used to do triathlon pre-covid, now have shifted to weight training). I loved the progress I saw and the ease of the keto diet.

One thing I did not like is the ""brain fog"" I experienced when on keto, even four months in. When in ketosis I would constantly have trouble articulating words or remembering names. The tip of the tongue syndrome was pretty constant and frustrating. As soon as I went off keto the phenomenon went away, so I'm confident the two are related.

Now, I've been off keto, stressed out from \*gestures around\* and have put the weight back on. I'd love to restart keto, but I do not want to deal with the brain fog / memory issues again. I know the normal answer here is ""get enough electrolytes"" - if so, could someone please provide the best blend of electrolytes for me? How often to consume? Or any other solutions to memory/speech issues others may have encountered from keto?

Thanks!!"
keto,What's the best way to initiate Ketosis?,"I've been trying this diet for the past month and I've made no progress, I know keto works, but I've had no progress. I've been eating fatty meats, cheese, and cauliflower, but I usually feel lost as to what the limits as to what foods I can eat. Should I fast for a day or two then just eat some bacon, or is it more complex than that?"
keto,Fat Adapted? Beyond Hungry,"I'm 37F, 207lbs, down from 222 in December. I started keto Jan 21. Everything's going great; I haven't gone out of ketosis and I've generally been eating less except the last couple days where I've been going over 3000 calories because I cannot stop eating. Is this normal when one becomes fat adapted? I otherwise cannot think of a reason why I ate a NY Strip for dinner with veggie sides and then made a second dinner immediately and ate it all, wanting more. I ended up 37g over my fat macro yesterday and meeting protein and was 10g under for net carbs. Thank you for any ideas. :)

keto,Need Guidance on Health and Keto,"     Back in 2017 I did keto for a good 4 months.   My results were insanely good and I loved the food the diet has to offer.  
     One issue I was having was heart palpitations.  I have cardiophobia.  My cardiophobia causes anxiety and sometimes full blown panic attacks.  I have checked into the hospital a couple times because of it.

     I want to do keto but I am extremely paranoid about the high fat content.  Some may say to ""ask your doctor what he thinks"", but I've come to learn some doctors like keto while others advice against it.  So really asking my doctor is a matter of ""does he believe in keto or not"".
     I read in a lot of places that keto is not good for you.  But I've been following this sub reddit for years and I see so much success.  

     Has anyone else been in the same boat as me?  And still done keto anyways?   Maybe some articles I haven't found on Google will help me."

keto,"Is it better to eat less, but more frequently, or vice versa?","Obese pre-diabetic here. I’m in a position where I have to do something about my weight, or have to deal with an ever increasing roster of symptoms. 

Almost all diets agree that physical activity is a must. All diets agree that processed food and starchy carbs ain’t good, and sugar is public enemy number one. 

Now if I understand correctly, the point of Keto is to prevent insulin rising above a certain level, and allow for the organism to switch over to ketones. So my question is, if it takes something like three days to switch the organism into starvation mode, wouldn’t it make more sense to reduce the height of the insulin spike rather than do intermittent fasting? I.e. if my eating window is three hours, isn’t it better to eat one hard-boiled egg every hour, rather than eat all three at once and eat nothing for the remaining time?"
keto,Help: Doctor's follow-up overseas,"Wondering if anyone had any kind of general literature that includes actual ""normal"" ranges for this kinda data you'd see on someone doing keto? 

My employer in China recently sent me in for a required annual physical that included a shit ton of scans and blood work, and now that the results are back, the medical center is freaking out thinking I have some severe metabolic condition (basically got  ""high"" cholestoral for my age group, very high ketone bodies, very low blood glucose, something a bit odd on my… 心电图报告?EKG?, and some other weird keto related). 

My ability to communicate with these doctors is not as high as I'd like given the language barrier, and not getting them on board with this could cause problems with my employer, so some more accessible literature (ie not hours of videos filmed in a language the docs are not THAT proficient in) would be really helpful. 

I can't really go off keto since I'm doing it to deal with a weird gut issue caused by inflammation, but living in China means I don't have the official diagnosis/paperwork to prove it.  My only option is to win this hospital over. 

Thanks in advance!"
keto,HELP!,"Hey everyone!

I'm not really new to keto as I ran the KD last year and lost around 40lbs. I fell off and am now about 2 months in again but really need some help as I haven't lost a single pound in the last 60 days. I'm not sure if there's something I'm doing wrong but I'm hoping some veterans can direct me of some things that I may need to change. I use carb manager to track macros. I seem to hit all my macros each day but unfortunately, I'm not seeing any results. I am also working out at home doing a combination of strength training and core exercises. I also work nightshift so I really only have 2 meals a day.

I am male, 32yo, 6ft and 321lbs as of about 12mins ago.

My basic diet is as follows:

Breakfast: 
4 fried eggs in about a tablespoon of butter
A large cup of coffee with 1tbs of mct oil and 1/2 cup heavy cream 

Lunch/dinner: 
This is where it gets a bit complicated. My wife and daughter are both in great shape and don't really follow any sort of diet. So to satisfy them and myself, I will usually make a main dish like meat curries, bbq/ grilled chicken and a side dish for them. I will eat the main dish by it's self with none of the carby sides and will maybe have a salad to go with it. 

Snacks:
Either/or
Veggie chips with peanut butter. 
A couple a cheesestrings. 
Maybe a caesar salad.

Supplements:
Magnesium
Vitamin D
Potassium

I usually come in around 18g of carbs, 150g of fat and 110g of protein.

Can anyone tell me what the hell I'm doing wrong here?

Thanks in advance."
keto,Down 34 pounds :D (PROGRESS PIC),"I would say the main thing that keeps me going strong is seeing other people's progress photos, and hearing about their journey. So while I'm definitely not to my goal yet, I wanted to make a progress post! The left pic is my before, and the right is now. The baggy clothes kind of hide just how big I was, which I think was the goal at the time haha.

Progress Pic: [https://imgur.com/uvSPGQO](https://imgur.com/uvSPGQO)

Been Keto for exactly 3 months, and down 34 pounds! In only 6 more pounds (hopefully 3 weeks) I will be halfway to my goal weight! I have struggled with weight my whole life, I've done diets off and on, but I always gain the weight back immediately. This is the first time something I have tried hasn't felt like a ""diet"". It is so easy, my cravings for sweets and carbs are almost non existent, I'm no longer hungry all the time, and best of all - I don't spend my days obsessively thinking about food anymore! And as a great bonus, my back and joint pain is gone, as are my headaches. 

My only major loss was in week 1 (10 pounds, mostly water weight I assume), and I average 2 pounds a week. At first I compared myself to others who lose big numbers on keto. But then I accepted we are all different, and the important thing is that the number is moving down! I haven't added exercise yet, although I've been really thinking lately that it is time. But I wanted to just focus on my WOE to start, until I got the hang of it. I use Carb Manager to track my macros, and unintentionally practice sporadic intermittent fasting (I don't get hungry as often). I try to eat clean whole foods as much as possible, but I do eat dirty on occasion as well, with processed or packaged foods. That flexibility makes it more sustainable for me personally.

I can't wait to see where this journey takes me, and to see how much more I can accomplish towards a healthier me. Keep Calm and Keto On my friends!"

keto,Hitting Protein vs Calorie intake,"So, ive been having trouble lately getting my macros within my calorie range. So far im working with:  


Protein: 188g  
Fat: 124g  
Kcals: 1850  


I know that protein is a goal and fat is a limit when trying to lose weight, and ive been struggling to get enough protein while also struggling not to get too much fat (the man loves cheese i cannot help it) but my main question is, if i reach my kcals for the day, but not the protein - should i stop eating and just take the protein loss or should i keep eating until i get the proteins on target and deal with the excess calories from that? What am i supposed to do in this situation while i work on eating less fat and trying to balance hunger?"
keto,I don't understand this shrimp nutritional label. Does Large shrimp have less protein than Small?,"So, in order to supplement protein I sometimes add some precooked tailless shrimp that I heat up and season as a side for chicken, beef, or whatever. Previously I've bought the Small and Extra-Small precooked tailless. 

With the recent Texas Freeze I was short on choices for meats. I found a Mercado (Mexican market) with boneless chicken breast and a 2-lb bag of frozen, cooked, tailless Large shrimp (different manufacturer from the other two). But the nutritional label is confusing me. 

Here the info on all 3:

Extra Small (serving size 84g)

- Calories: 90
- Fat: 1.5g
- Carbs: 0g
- Protein: 19g

Small (serving size 85g)

- Calories: 80
- Fat: 1g
- Carbs: 0g
- Protein: 16g

Large (serving size 84g)

- Calories: 39
- Fat: 0.2g
- Carbs: 0g
- Protein: 9g

Why are the Large so different from the smaller sizes when the serving weight is practically the same? I've heard of international manufacturers using net carbs instead of total carbs, but not a change in calories, fat, or protein. None are flavored or seasoned. Shrimp should be shrimp. 

Any insights?"

Without hesitating I said yes but we need to get dad in the loop so the whole household will be in this together.   We set the date last Tuesday and starting looking at what we can eat and what we need to get out of the house.  There were a few speed bumps but not much.  My daughter gave up her coffee and her soda and went through withdrawal for 2 days.  Anyways, last night she came home from working out and she had the biggest smile on her face.  She acted out how she was on the scale moving the weight down the bar.  She thought she lost 1 lb but not 5.  I am so proud of her. 

It is crazy but this diet has brought us all closer.  We pick out recipes together, meal plan and try to think of different alternatives.   I can’t wait for the weeks to come.

keto,Stupid BBQ ribs tracking question,"Hi all -

I'm obsessive with my tracking (down to the gram)  but one food item has me stumped. Pork ribs. When tracking do I weigh the entire rib (meat + bone) and log that weight, or do I log only the weight of the meat? I can't tell from my tracking app if their nutritional information per serving includes the bone or not! (I'm using the free Sparkpeople app for my tracking, fyi). FWIW, I logged for the total weight of meat + bone to be overly cautious, but I just wanted to check if that was the right thing to do!

What do you BBQ fans do when logging? Thanks everyone!"

keto,Keto to manage illness,"The background: My husband is an active duty Marine and has never had a weight issue. Around July of last year he began to have strange symptoms. Weakness in his legs and feet. Numbness tingling and the like. We started on a low carb diet just to help him manage his weight since he was unable to PT. His symptoms worsened and he fell off the low carb wagon and then the symptoms were so bad he was having trouble walking. We are in the process of trying to get a diagnosis through a neurologist but in the meantime I got him to try keto with me (I read somewhere keto can help with neurological diseases) 
As of today:  we are two weeks in and almost immediately his symptoms lessened. Yesterday he went for a run! Only two miles, that’s short for him but he hasn’t felt well enough to run since about September 2020. I’d just like to know if there is anyone here who has experience with keto helping them so quickly to feel so much better? I’m very interested to hear your stories. Honestly it would just be nice to hear if this is related to his diet or his disease. I tend to believe it’s the diet since it’s really the only thing that has changed."

Felt great.

Male, 33, 5'11"" Started off at 340. Down 22 lbs since I started in January. It has been an adjustment. I find myself eating less and being full longer and going longer between meals. I don't have ""breakfast"" until close to lunch time now. I'm not trying to do IF but it's just naturally happening. I was finding the tracking/counting/planning to be the worst but I solved that problem with a carb manager app and now I can plan the whole day out very quickly everyday. Makes it so much easier! The only thing I'm working on now is the variety as some of the repetitions of food I was doing was getting old, but I guess that will happen when trying to keep it simple as I hate prep and planning. I have found my perfect sweet tooth craving solution. My wife makes me a keto chocolate pudding, with heavy cream, and unflavored gelatin, powdered swerve and cocoa powder. It is so good! Can't really even tell the difference. She makes me about a bowl and it usually lasts about a week. I have 3-4 spoonfuls a day if I really get a sugar craving. Been finding it useful to add some mct powder to my coffee, with some sugar free caramel vanilla powdered creamer, or heavy whipping cream. Gives me a nice boost of fat to my daily intake. Starting to get a stable handle on things now. Mind over matter. It's getting easier and I'm feeling better! I did set a deficit and I don't worry to much right now if I go over my macros or cals. Sometimes I do, but not by much. My one focus is staying under 20g of carbs daily and now that's easy :) No excuses. Just do it. 💪😎"

keto,Eating more fat/easy stuff to get at the store,"For my fellow picky eaters, here are my fave sources/how I get more fat.

Bacon and bacon grease - I eat bacon in the morning and fry my eggs in the grease, and I count the grease as part of my macros since I’m cooking/eating it with the egg.

Olive oil, Mayo - not a big avocado fan, but I do love olive oil and Mayo. I like making super simple salads, leaves, cheese, a lot of fatty dressing, and usually bacon or chicken thigh for protein. I find it’s easier to get fats in if they’re in a sauce or something, kind of similar to the concept of drinking your calories but they’re good fats. 

Cream cheese, heavy whipping cream, butter - also great for making sauces, but also super versatile in how they can be used. I like cooking with these since it’s similar to salad dressing, make them into a sauce and you can get in a lot more fat easily. I like to sauté broccoli in about 1-2 tbs of butter, which doesn’t sound like a lot but 2tbs butter is a lot of fat for one portion of food

At one point my white blood cell count was fairly (for my age) low, my doctor claimed that it wasn’t an issue if I was on keto and that is was relatively expected. 

Really I was just curious if anyone has had a negative impact from doing keto health wise?"
keto,Questions about Keto., I want to start keto soon but my main concern is gaining more weight than I lose after quitting the diet. Will I need to wean myself on to carbs? will I still lose weight even if I eat a lot? What food do you eat when you're out of the house? Is it hard to stick to?
keto,Really struggling,"I'm on week 4, day 1 of keto. I'm still not seeing a lot of great benefits from it, and I miss carbs and sugar so damn much. I've gained 3 lbs since last week (for a total of less than 6 lbs lost, which seems low compared to other people), and I'm pretty sure it's because I'm not counting calories. I'm not doing that because I have so much going on in my life, I don't cook the food for the most part (SO does), and I don't know that I have the mental and emotional energy needed to devote to diligently tracking both calories AND macros, much less things like electrolytes. This is all starting to become too much and I absolutely hate this diet.

Is this just not for me? Can I please just stop and go back to just counting calories instead? Or do I just need to push through? I committed to 3 months because my SO wanted to do it and it seemed like it would be a good thing to do, but I just don't know that I have the capacity to do this right now. I'm dropping the ball on other things in my life because I'm so preoccupied with what I eat and this diet. I have so much anxiety over it. But people keep talking about how great it is, how it's hard at first but you have to keep on, and I will feel like such a failure if I stop now. However, it's so overwhelming, and I don't seem to be taking to it like a lot of people who post here do, nor as quickly.

What should I do?

Edit - Thank you all for the encouragement, validation, and ideas. I really appreciate your help. I think I can stick with this a little while longer, especially with some of your ideas/methods."
keto,Struggling and its only the second day..,"My husband and I started doing the keto diet a couple days ago. Yesterday, I was very irritable. Today, all I can think about is that bottle of Fanta we never finished, the fruit gushers we have in the pantry, the left over Halloween candy and etc... everything sugar 😖
I have lived my life entirely on sugar. Any tips as to how to feel better?.. Im currently eating my lunch with asparagus, bell peppers, pork belly and a hard boiled egg. And all I want is sugar"
keto,Keto Lifestyle newb,"Hey everyone. I'm not totally new to Keto (put coconut oil and grass-fed butter in my coffee 8 years ago). I've eaten clean-ish (good fats, quality proteins, just LOVE gravy, biscuits, and tubers too much) for about the same amount of time. I normally do about 80% of the cooking for what my family eats and haven't really had any weight problems. Until covid/career change (almost at the exact same time). 

I went from a rail thin kid, to a ""normal sized"" adult doing heavy equipment maintenance for about 15 years. I drank beer almost every day, ate biscuits and gravy for most breakfasts, and never hit the gym. My weight stayed the same for about 12 years, and I was comfortable with my body, and it was great that I could eat whatever I wanted and drink like a frat boy at the same time. 

Well, I went back to college, and when covid hit I graduated shortly after.. I wasn't walking 7 miles a day, I wasn't carrying 75lb parts around, and I wasn't working out. But, I WAS drinking and eating like I always did. In the last year I have gained close to 40lbs, even though I cut my alcohol to a 6pk one day a week, and was keeping my calories on the other 6 days a week around 2200 (supposedly well below my sedentary RMR). I still kept gaining. 

I've done whole30 before (not for dieting, just diagnostics) so I knew where to get some exogenous fats locally without issue. 

Yesterday was day 1. I woke up yesterday, saw my beer belly and stretch marks in the mirror when I was brushing my teeth and called it. I have eaten ""mostly keto"" off and on for a while, but this will be my first attempt at changing my lifestyle. If I am desk bound and not super excited about working out, AND I dont like the way I look and feel, I atleast need to give a strict Keto a solid 6 months. So far I am satiated, and have no cravings (beer cravings will be the hard one, I've never cared for sweets, and only really craved pizza/chips/burgers when I was drunk. Wish me luck!"
keto,The Keto Advanced,So lately I've been seeing a lot of ads for a dietary supplement called keto advanced.

If anyone has any personal experiences please let me know thanks!
keto,How will sauerkraut change gut microbes?,"I came across the information(unverified) that the bacteria digesting sugar and fibre are different from the once digesting fat(which release bile ) 

and 

wonder that if eating sauerkraut would build a gut flora that is unsuited for someone who is eating a diet centred around fat. Should I eat sauerkraut or avoid it?"
keto,Grinding down lupini beans,"I purchased some pre-ground lupini to make some hummus and it didn't work at all. The texture was just too gritty.  On the other hand I was able to make grits and they tasted great. Almost like the real thing - if Id added more water I may not have been able to tell the difference. Threw some cheese on it too! Shrimp and grits, the possibilities are....limited.

To grind up dried beans, you just toss them in a food processor? Will the hard beans kill my blades? I just bought a ninja.

Thanks"
keto,Powdered Coffee Creamer,"Hello, I am pretty new to Keto and have not had good luck finding a flavorful coffee creamer. I like to have a good tablespoon and used to use powdered Coffeemate sugar free hazelnut. But I would really like zero carbs. I've tried several liquid keto creamers that are zero carb, but they do not provide enough color or creamy flavor."
keto,Insights into cholesterol,"I’m hoping someone may have insights or seen a similar issue. I’ve been strict keto since October. I mentioned in another post that my recent bloodwork had high cholesterol readings. My doc wasn’t concerned about the ldl at 159 and hdl at 28. He did say I needed to work on raising the hdl. 

I ran across something online from the Mayo Clinic iirc that said hdl helps flush ldl out of the body. So if that is the case would raising hdl decrease the ldl? Has anyone seen this in practice? The supplement recommended was niacin. Triglycerides were at 80. 

He did mention that high protein intake could impact cholesterol, I’m eating 137g or more daily as my macros. Also male, 47, 5’9” currently at 199 down from 270 thanks to keto."
keto,Help! I got a stomach bug and cravings are intense.,"I’m in my 3rd week of keto and am so proud of how far Iv made it and how easy this last week has been on saying no to cravings. Last night I got a stomach bug and couldn’t keep anything down literally the thought of eating meat or cheese or anything In the keto food group sounded repulsive. I got my fever and chills to subside and now all I want is a big smoothie, a big bowl of fruit anything with fruits. I think my body is telling me I need the vitamin c and all the vitamins and minerals you get from fruit. I do believe our body’s tell us what we need unless it’s cookies and candy’s... haha. I also have really bad constipation, and have tried every trick i know to go and nothing. I’m starting to believe all the people who say keto is really not good for the body. Iv done keto in the past, I lasted two months and afterwards I went through this phase where meat made me want to gag. Im trying to think of something to eat today but I’m getting that same experience... anything keto makes me feel ill. I’m really curious about other people’s experiences, has anyone else been sick during keto and almost jumped off the bandwagon? Or after trying keto was really turned away but dairy/meats and such? (

Also I sound like I’m in AA or something but for carbs and this is weird😂)"
keto,Can’t seem to eat enough calories?,"I’m new to Keto, I’m using Sanza to track my eating they’ve calculated my daily calorie intake to where it should meet 1800. I’ve only been doing Keto for about 2 weeks but I cannot seem to get anywhere close. Yesterday I only made it to 700. Before this I was really only a 1 meal a day type of person but usually take out or something unhealthy now I’ve been trying to eat three meals and somehow can’t meet the calories.

How important is it that I’m meeting the calories and fat?  

What things can I do to improve? 

I’ve been eating a lot of eggs and chicken breast, but have switched it up to no avail."
keto,I Lost 15 1/2 Lbs In 8 Days,"had blood tests done and my doc informed me i am diabetic and i should change my diet.  She directed me to Dr Michael Mosley and i read through his offerings and started the 8 week blood sugar diet.  It is keto but also low calorie (800 per day approx).  the first week was a bit rough but after 10 days im on an even keel and performing nicely.   loving the diet and when this initial drive to push the diabetes into remission, i look forward to full keto meals."
keto,Intermittent fasting / OMAD and reaching caloric requirements should I force myself to eat more ?,"So I've started keto about 4.5 weeks ago and have done it last year for 10 weeks so I'm not new to keto but this time something different is happening. Both those times I did intermittent fasting the same way which would be waking up go through my day and start eating between 4-7pm and stop eating at 8-9pm so that means sometimes it was one meal a day

Last year when intermittent fasting I had issues staying under my caloric limit and hat to put in effort in order not to over eat when hungry (so it wasn't hard to do intermittent fasting but when I had to eat I was hungry af) 
This time around and it's been like that I'd say the past 3 weeks, I'm pretty sure I'm 6/7 days under 1200 kcal a day ( the days I track calories I'm around 1000kcal ) but I'm just not hungry 

Should I force myself to eat more in order not to 'crash-diet' ? 

Edit : I sometimes, about once a week, don't do intermittent fasting and eat at 12"
keto,A small but made me smile NSV,"I've been keto just over two years, had great success and am firmly in maintenance mode.  It's been a while since I've had someone notice my weight loss in a Wow! kind of way.    Yesterday, went to the dentist for my six month check up.   I had a new, very pleasant hygienist get me prepped.   She was sitting at the computer behind me and I hear her go quiet.   Then she asks, "" Um, can you tell me your name again?"".  I did and she said, ""Wow!  You don't look anything like your picture!"".  There was a picture taken a few years ago when I was at my heaviest attached to my dental file.  She thought she had the wrong file pulled up!  Ha-ha!   Made my day.

keto,I need help figuring this out,So.. Im trying to get into a keto diet. But searching up on google what to make (easily) like 30 mins im in Denmark so the fast food here nearby me isn't keto friendly i need recipes preferably with chicken. The morning i already figured out just making bacon and eggs. Im only Gonna eat lunch and dinner
keto,Can't do this,"I've been on keto for a week now feel very energized and i really like the mental clarity and focus it gives me
But i can't keep up with it mainly because of the carb restriction  i love board eating and I can't do that with keto i don't really enjoy the taste of oily things I can't eat nuts forever  i love eating meat but you can't eat a lot of meat cuz I'll exceed my 100 gram protein limit quickly
Almost 99% of the foods that i like contain carbs.

For me oily things are tasteless there is no pleasure in stuffing nuts and buttery meat and eggs down my throat 24/7  so i feel like i won't be able to maintain this diet for a long time cuz there are times that i would enjoy a piece of bread or 200 grams of rice with my chicken or having a hard candy with my tea and.....
I feel like keto is not sustainable for me unless i torture myself with nuts and butter and salad with mayo or olive oil or other foods that i don't enjoy 
I think this diet is probably better for people who love the taste of greasy things I don't."
keto,migraines on keto / refine sugar deprivation,"Hi, redditers!

So keto helps many people with migraines, but its quite the contrary for me

I don't eat starches / dough / rice / grains etc for several years now, so my diet pretty much is eggs / fish / meat and plenty of salads and veg, but Im having frequent migraines when on keto (I remember to consume salt, water and electrolytes)

So when I go off keto I add some fruits and I can have a dessert (like cake or ice cream) every now and then, migraines become way less frequent; but as soon as cut refine sugar (even if Im off keto and eat lots of fruits daily, or proper keto for several month, regardless) migraines come back

I don't really want to be eating some refine sugar daily to prevent migraines, but I don't see another solution

Any suggestions or similar experience? Thx

PS Sorry if I was not clear enough, Im having a migraine right now :) :("
keto,Questions about insulin diabetes and blood sugar,"I don't have diabetes but I was curious can doing keto raise the risk of getting it or mess with insulin negatively?

And In the past I did a egg diet which is slightly more protein than fat and after a few months of doing it I had blood work done and everything came back good besides low blood sugar is this sorta normal?

(Forgot to ask this in the op) but can diet drinks be dangerous on keto?"
keto,High result in Uric Acid test,"Hi,  
I started keto on January 10th, and I'm checking my Uric Acid with a blood meter (originally bought for ketone testing).  


Since I've started keto I'm getting high results and it's not improving. Few days after I started I did a blood test and got 10.1 mg/dL . The last result from today is 12.7 mg/dL. A year ago I did a blood test and got 7.7 mg/dL.  


I don't feel any ""new"" pain or something like that but I'm getting worried that I will develop some illness from this diet (Gout, Kidney stones, etc.).  


Also, I did a little research on this subreddit and other places and I saw that the Uric Acid levels might rise in the beginning of this diet and should drop back after some time, but the current level seems a bit scary.  


I know it's not a place for medical advices but I would like to hear from your experiance.  
Thanks"
keto,"Starting keto today, any encouragement or well wishes would be extremely welcomed","Hey everyone, I'm getting started on keto today and just making a post to get some feelings out. I'm very frustrated with where I'm at physically right now. 

I did keto in 2019 and had amazing results and felt great. I stopped bc I got pregnant and didn't want to restrict my diet, but I had my baby 8mo ago and am really out of excuses. I gained approximately one million pounds during the pregnancy and have had zero motivation to lose it now that I'm home all the time during this terrible pandemic. It's excuses excuses all day long for me. 

My husband gained as much weight as I did if not more during my pregnancy and I feel like I need to makw this change in lifestyle if we are ever going to get any spark back in our relationship. It's just been a 1.5 year junk food fest and every night I go to bed bloated and gassy. He tells me every day his stomach hurts and finally went to the doc recently and was put on medicine for GERD. I just know our problems are related to having a horrible diet. It's horrible for our sex life and just for our overall lives. I'm not expecting him to do keto necessarily but I know me making positive changes will impact us both.

This month it's like I kicked my poor eating into overdrive. My husband got me my favorite sweets for valentines day and not just normal quantities but in amounts meant for kids to bring to share with an entire classroom, literally. So I've been binge eating sugary candy for weeks. My stomach is so bloated right now I look pregnant again. I feel disgusting. I asked if he would be offended if I tossed the candy and he said he wanted to keep it. So I put it away in his space but every night I get it out and eat more.

Sorry for the rant but ai am just feeling fucking done right now with the way I've been living. I'm done waitinf for him to change in order for me to change. I'm done waiting till the candy is gone go change. I'm done waiting till March 1 to change, or waiting till the pandemic is over to change. I talked to my husband about starting keto and he said let's wait until we eat the food we have in our freezer. I'm done doing tbat. I can make a change now, just me, just because. I can do this starting on a Tuesday in the middle of February during a pandemic! Screw procrastinating and screw waiting for anyone else's permission. 

I'm going for it.. plz wish me luck!! I've really struggled to stick with any plans for eating healthy while trapped at home 24/7. Any encouragement would be much appreciated!!! 🙏🏻"
keto,Keto noob here! Please help!,"Hey guys! I'm about to get on the keto diet and had a few questions and would really appreciate if you could help me!

Im 24yo female currently at about 5.2 and 190-200lb. I've always been overweight and never really was successful on diet except that one time about 3 years ago where I ate about 500-700 calories for two months, walking 9 miles everyday and lost 40lb which resulted in huge hair loss and gaining another 50lb over two years.

I've recently started going on diet and I know, it's unhealthy but ended up eating about 500-600 (20-50g carbs maximum a day) calories this entire month and lost about 14lb. But I realized this is not something I'll be able to keep it for another 6 months and also I'm scared that I'm going to lose muscle when I already have no muscle or whatsoever since I don't work out at all, and barely moves everyday. (I've started doing 30mins workout everyday doe, other than that I'm currently not working and don't go out much so don't move around too much) SO, I've finally decided to go on keto even though I have that fear of intaking calories over 1000.

Sorry for the long introduction but my question at this point I'm about to go ob keto diet is, 

1, after checking macro, I've got 125g protein, 20g carbs,82g fat which is about 1318 daily intake. Is it ok to eat less calories at about 800-900 ish? Will it affect me after keto as in getting yoyo effect? Would it be unhealthy?

2,I've realized it is extremely hard to do a simple 30mins cardio routine after eating calories less than 500. I literally felt dizzy while doing so and even when I'm simply getting up. Also during covid, about an entire year I was going through depression so I stayed home all day, doing nothing so lost lots of muscle. Is going on keto will help me gaining muscle? Would it help me improving athletic performance?

3, I've found myself hard eating too much fat but protein seemed to be fine. Is it ok to have 5:4:2 ratio at fat/protein/carb instead of 7:2:1?

4, I usually eat one meal a day (sometimes two). Is it ok to do it while being on keto as well?


Sorry for the long post and broken English:(  I I know these questions might sound silly but id really appreciate it if you could help me. I really do wanna lose weight before I get any older and really wanna make it this time. Thanks for reading!!"
keto,Lost 20 pounds in 17 days,"I always wanted to lose weight but I always procrastinated and never bought in to it. I started keto on February 6th weighing 261 pounds. I’m not a big guy you couldn’t tell I was that heavy because of my build I have big broad shoulders and strong legs that kinda masked the weight. I wanted to change though as I felt like I could be in a lot better shape then I was so I started doing keto. It’s crazy to see the weight fall off you even after a single day after you finally reach ketosis. I’ve learned so much about my body and what I’m putting into my body during this process. I really recommend trying this diet out. As of today I’m down to 239 pounds and I just feel a lot more confident and healthy after not even 3 weeks. I was eating under 20 carbs a day some days even less than 2. If you’re just starting out I don’t actually recommend going this low as you will feel kinda nauseous at times. I’ve decided to change to 50 carbs a day and even joined a local gym to start working out. If there’s anyone out there thinking about losing weight and just always putting it off, that was me at one point too. Trust me try it out and you will realize it’s not as bad as you’re thinking it is. Once you start getting in shape you will fall in love with it in a way and you’re body and self esteem will thank you for it"
keto,I’m mad at myself... (mug cakes),"Okay I’ve literally tried almost every keto dessert possible and hated them all but last week I decided to try mug cakes and they’re the bomb! I don’t even feel the need to cheat on my diet as much anymore. I’m so mad at myself for not trying them earlier. All those bags of almond and coconut flour wasted, all of those bowls, muffin tins, etc being used and all of that time wasted on fancy recipes and what do you know.. a 1 min mug cake thrown in the microwave is the best keto dessert I’ve ever had besides some good old berries and cream.

I have it on my neck, underarms and between my thighs. I have it on the sides of my neck and it bothers me a lot. All my life i have tried to hide my neck. I'm insulin resistant! I see my patches getting dark post ovulation and are little lighter near and after my period. So I'm assuming the insulin is reduced during those times. But what I don't understand is being on keto and on a fasted state doesn't show any improvement in my AN. Have heard so many stories about keto helping with insulin resistance. If it was helping with IR it should have showed some improvement in my AN too. My endo upped my metformin to 1000mg ER a day from being on 500mg for many years. Plus I'm taking inositol too. People who were slightly overweight or normal weight but had AN, and saw a resolution later, please help. I don't want to lose hope."

Lazy keto over here. I've been doing it long enough that I am confidently in control of my weight, I can cut or bulk quite successfully. But I've been trying to do both lately (moderately?).
My energy levels lately have been awful. Mentally, my focus sucks from waking up until 5pm or so.im a student so I need my brain to fire on at least 5 cylinders. After breaking my fast (8-12 hr eating windows) I basically break down. It's not really a nap, more of an uncomfortable shutdown). I sleep well in the evenings. 
My meals are very low glycemic index. I workout 3-5 days week (2 hrs climbing/weight training). I eat when I'm hungry. It would seem uncomfortable to eat more. 
My last hydrostatic body mass test revealed 16.5 percent body. That was probly 5 months ago and I'm likely 15% or less now.

keto,Long Term Keto,"Someone suggested I make a post about the success of long term keto, and why I've stuck with it. In short, because it works. There have been no negative health issues from keto. There have been numerous benefits. I can't offer empirical evidence as I have no doctor. I have not seen on in over a decade. I believe keto makes my body work more efficiently. It seems to boost my immune system to the point I never get sick. I think this is because it lightens the load on the liver,  but I leave it to others to figure out the science of it all. 

   In summary I believe it is beneficial to eat keto for life. I'm including a pic which is a year or 2 old,  but I generally look the same now. I am 63 years old. I have not yet achieved my ideal physique, but am pretty much done with fat loss at least. If I can do this, you can do it too. [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cj6JMdq.jpg)"

keto,People downvoting in this community for no apparent reason.,"Besides this recent bit, I've tried to post in this community before and run in to the same problems. 

I can ask a pretty simple question and get downvoted just for asking it. If you say something that people don't like they downvoted you here more aggressively than any other community I've visited.

Is it actual members of this community, who contribute and care, that are doing the downvoting? I find it hard to believe so.

Usually in communities with people who are rightfully critical of something, they will invest the small amount of time necessary to correct the person.

So either 

1. People here are just lazy and think they know better, so they downvote more without contribution (I've seen this before but I hope it's not the case)

Or 2. Ya'll have some militant vegans or other anti-keto people lurking around here and downvoting people who are trying to learn for no reason.

I don't know what can even be done about it, but it's irritating. I don't even care about belonging to a ""community"", but I do want to get and share information on this topic.

Straight up - is this community littered with a fair % of assholes who downvote anything they don't like without a good reason? Or all you all under attack from militant vegans? If so, do you need help? I'll send steak and butter bullets."
keto,Absolutely love Keto but having trouble yielding results.,"At my heaviest I was 216lb, that was last year. I was absolutely devastated to have gotten into the 200's but once I snowballed I didn't know how to get back. But with regularly healthy eating (whole grains, salads, etc) I managed to curb my weight to 203 and the scale absolutely refused to move.

All I could think about was getting under 200, but the pounds wouldn't come off anymore. I was trying to figure out the next step when I remembered about doing Keto in highschool. I had absolutely loved the lifestyle and easily lost 20 pounds within the first 4 months, only to completely stop losing for the preceding 8 months.

Anyway, I went back to Keto for the first time in over two years, and was immediately reminded of why I loved it so much. Research is my favorite thing to do so keeping track of sodium, carbs, calories and all that is my bread and butter. 

I excitedly weighed myself every week for two months, and the grand total of weight loss is going down to 196. I can't get under that number and I'm getting increasingly disheartened. I initially ate under 50 grams of carbs, then thinking that that was the problem I switched to eating under 20 grams about two weeks ago; and yet, the scale won't move. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to stop doing Keto in fear that I'll gain it all back.  Should I eat under 10/5grams instead of under 20? I don't cheat at all. I don't exercise often to be fair, but I dogwalk a few times a week.

I’ve looked at a lot of website and sum up what to do to maximize chance to prevent, and to get rid of it the quicker. 

1st it seems that in the keto adaptation phase, you are more prone to have gout attack. Here is what I did NOT do that i think could have saved me some painful days...

*Prevent*

✅ Drink enough water!!! (i mean a lot)
✅ Be sure to have a good amount of electrolytes
✅ Consume lots of green veggies to get your potassium

*Help to get rid*

Once i started loading LOT of water, adding salt, it resorbed 2 days after.

Elevate the foot and (might hurt) massaging softly to help circulation when it was elevate seem to have helped. 

It was my third and longest gout flare ever and i wish it was the last! This shit hurts."
keto,Thought on Barebells Protein Bars?,"Surprised I haven’t seen more posts on them here! Stumbled upon them at Trader Joe’s. Their flavors are delicious and all of their bars are 0 net carbs!!

E.g. the Cookies And Cream bar has 17 g total carbs, 3 g fiber, and 14 g of sugar alcohol. 

They started in Sweden is 2016 but their products didn’t reach the US until just last year so maybe that’s why I’m not seeing more posts on them?

Anyway, for those who’ve tried them, what do you think? 

Here are the ingredients for the Carmel Cashew (list is about the same for each bar):

protein blend (calcium caseinate, whey protein concentrate, whey protein isolate), glycerol, collagen, maltitol, polydextrose, cocoa butter, water, cashew, milk powder, sunflower oil, cocoa mass, peanut paste (peanuts, peanut oil), cocoa powder, natural and artificial flavors, soy lecithin, sucralose, acesulfame-k.


What’s the deal with Maltitol btw? Is that a sugar alcohol that doesn’t count and if so, why not?"

keto,Keto helped me beat my unhealthy diet mentality.,"Good morning Keto warriors!

As I was driving to work on this brisk February morning, I was reflecting on my almost 2 month Keto journey and how far I have come.

I used to crash diet like crazy. You know the song and dance by now- I grew up as a bigger girl, didn't understand nutrition,  I starved myself (not proper fasting, just extreme calorie restriction) or ate chicken breast and steamed veggies until I cracked and ate an entire Chipotle burrito in one sitting, etc.

**I remember it getting to the point where I would be so hungry, my stomach cramped and hurt and I felt \*rewarded\***.

That, folks, is how you start a ED. My blood sugar would flip up and down constantly and I found myself super annoyed and moody all the time. But if I was hungry and it hurt, it was working right?

Wrong.

I remember crying the first time I weighted myself after a week of eating tasty meat and buttered veggies and seeing that I had lost weight.

Keto taught me to understand portions, understand calories, understand nutrients and minerals.  Keto saved me from a possible dark path of obsession and control over how little I could get away with eating and I will always be grateful."
keto,A bit of personal story,"This will be a bit of a personal story from last week...
I am working an office job which can put too much pressure on you. Long hours, heavy work load, minimum or no recognition. Typical corpo style...
Been struggling for a while, but I found that the keto diet actually helps to keep the mental balance. Started keto mid January because I heard about the positive aspects it can have for you body and mind (weight lose is not my goal). And it works - for the past month I have been more resilient then ever and I was able to sustain the work and all bull crap that was happening.
But this week I snapped. The work was too much and I broke out from the keto diet. Since Monday I had 2 takeaways and got some ice cream every other day. And I am sorry to admit, but it helped... My brain's reward centre reacted to the spike of glucose in my body and I feel this helped me to survive the week.
Since yesterday I have been back on my standard keto plan, but I am afraid next week will be as heavy with work as this one.
This is actually my first time I have been on keto and I wander what would you do?
Would you prefer to get off keto until the work gets better and you feel more comfortable without sugar in your body?
Or would you rather push yourself with keto to try keeping it as healthy as possible?"

keto,Never too late for change!,"Am 74 year old woman and have NEVER been successful with any diet: Jenny Craig, McDougall’s, Atkins, Weight Watchers, etc. While the most I wanted to lose was 15 to 20 lbs., I could not break through until a friend told me last summer how she was losing weight like crazy and how wonderful she felt on keto. I had to try it. 

So, here I am after losing 15 pounds over six months and not only loving this new “diet”, but enjoying a lifestyle complete with healthier joints and muscle mass, clearer thinking and motivation, and loving the food variety! Do I still have a few age-related aches and pains? Yes, but they are significantly less. 

I go to a biofeedback practitioner 30 years younger than me who was so impressed with the change in my numbers, she started keto herself though not for weight loss. Coming from the point of someone who felt it was my destiny to accept my ever increasing weight as a fact of getting older, I am super grateful to have discovered this new way of living. 

I encourage folks my age (especially those who are boomer foodies and wine aficionados) to try this new lifestyle. Truth be told, I’m discovering how wonderful and easy keto recipes can be, though not a fan of the ubiquitous cauliflower rice! My husband is enjoying the dining experiences as much as I am.  We have drastically reduced our wine consumption by substituting gin (and non-alcohol “gin”) and diet tonics. Amazing the difference! No more brain fog. 

Enjoying the journey, along with my new keto buddies 😊"
keto,Is possible to set different values of micronutrient from the original Keto diet,"Hello, I started Keto about a week ago, and I found out that i can’t reach the fat goal every day. 

I set the total calories to about 1920 cal per (500 cal minus my BMR) and wanted to achieve the regular keto division : 75% fat, 20% protein, 5% carbs. 

The problem is that I can’t reach to 75% fat because I mainly eat lean protein , I avoid red meat because it is high with saturated fats, and I avoid trans fats as well. 
I barely eat diary products as well ( cheese, cream and butter) for the same reason - high with saturated fats. 

I mainly consume chicken thighs and turkey breast in high quantities and fat rich foods such as nuts and peanut butter. 

On a regular day I eat about 140g protein 96g of fat and 30-40g of carbs ( I can lower that too )
And not reaching my total calorie goal which result to eating about 1600-1700 calories a day.

It is much easier for me to reach high protein goal instead of high fat goal. 

Is it possible to set the micronutrient to 5% carbs, 40% protein (180g) and 55% fat ( 110g) and still enjoy the benefits of keto?

Thank you"
keto,"Keto, mood variabilities, and unusual troubleshooting experiences","Some people seem to experience, (most) experience increased resilience, mood stability, calmness, motivation, etc. when doing Keto. 

Others seem to struggle with irritability, aggression, and generally get pissed off. 

Personally, I've always been somewhere in the middle. 

For myself, when I diet to lower bf% this gets worse, I'm already not the most social person so it exacerbates that base programming which is that I don't really value ""niceness"", as much as truthfulness.

 To put it simply and somewhat obtusely, if serotonin can help contribute to social complacency then I would say I've never been accused of being a ""serotonin dominant"" person (if there is such a thing).

Anyways, to get to my point,  there's obviously the factor of the actual execution of the diet to consider when troubleshooting.. and it seems like people here start there which is key. 

As the problems can get more complicated for some, at what point do you start to consider managing other biological issues?

Like for example, years ago I was inspired by Mark Sisson and ""The Primal Blueprint"", back before any community like this existed. As he suggested then, health is also all the other key biological expectations we tend to overlook. 

For me, lack of sunlight and probably vitamin D has been contributing to low serotonin and making my aggression and irritation worse, I'm finally realizing.

So for people here, I am wondering if you'd be willing to talk about some of the more ""unusual"" issues that you've had to trouble shoot beyond just ""proper execution""? 

I think that when it comes to sharing information, that sort of discussion is important because we tend to overlook it."

keto,Keto for nerve damage?,"I had an operation on my leg all the way back in 2011 that gives me trouble even today due to nerve damage caused by waking up in surgery. I don't have much sensation in my left shin, calf, or foot, and I suspect the impact covers even more of that leg than I realise. The right side of my body overcompensates for any deficiency or weakness in the left, resulting in various injuries over the years. The worst part is the left leg from the knee down sometimes cramps up and will spasm and twitch for hours or days for no apparent reason. It wakes me up at night on a semi-regular basis, and the cramps can occasionally spread to the whole left leg. On those days/nights it is excruciating and I can't walk at all.

I've just been putting up with it till now, until last night with particularly bad episode. It hurt so much it scared me. I'm wondering if keto is an answer. I can't drink coffee at all anymore, not even decaf, possibly because anything dehydrating makes the muscle cramps worse.

I have noticed that sometimes it seems a high carb intake means more likelihood of muscle twitching/cramps/spasms. I don't know whether this is an accurate correlation, but I was wondering if anyone had treated similar injuries with keto or a low carb diet?"
keto,Back on a slower horse.,"Hey guys,

Was on Keto for 2019. It changed my life and I dropped 185 pounds in one year hitting a low of 275 from 462 lbs. Cue to post 2020 and I've gained 50+ pounds of it back due to high alcohol consumption and neglecting my diet throughout lockdown. I lost my job and was isolated from friends and family for most of the year. The gym also closed for pretty much the entire year and still is. Essentially, things got out of control. I'm not ruminating on it and already back on the horse to finish the job.  The problem is I'm losing weight considerably slower than the first time around. I tracked my weight loss and macros religiously throughout 2019 and I'm copying that exact routine right now but with less significant results. Any idea what this could be?

keto,How bad is maltodextrin for keto?,"I usually drink 1-2 packets of the Kroger-brand crystal light, about 5 days per week.  I like it because the caffeine keeps me energized through my typical 16-hour fast and also lets me do heavy cardio and weight lifting during that period.  It has only 15 calories and 3g of carbs per packet, so I'm able to stay well within my caloric and macro goals.  I've dropped from 245lbs to 235 bs in the 2 weeks I've been on keto, but I assume most (or all) of that was water weight.

I'm just worried because it does contain maltodextrin (it's in the ingredients list but doesn't say how much).  I've searched old posts on this sub and seen people trying to avoid it, but I don't know if it's something that needs to be 100% avoided or just moderated.  I've checked all my other food and this is the only source of maltodextrin I can find.  Should I dump it entirely or is it acceptable in moderation?"
keto,A Question About Ketosis and Autophagy," I've been hearing mixed numbers on when ketosis and autophagy begin in the body, with some saying ketosis begins at hour 14 of fasting, others say 16, and I've even read it takes ***days*** to reach ketosis.

Likewise with autophagy, I have been seeing 16 hours, 24 hours, and 36+ hours.

I am hoping everyone here can help shed some light onto this subject, or at least give me a decent idea of when I should expect my body to reach these states.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if knowing my composition would help with this, but if it does, I am 180lbs, 5ft7in, and 33yo male. Currently \~25% body fat (which I am trying to reduce with fasting and nutrition).

I walk 10 miles per day for my cardio and rely on my bodyweight for resistance training (I have no equipment). My nutrition ranges between 1500-1900 calories daily and I live on a 18:6 intermittent fasting regimen."
keto,I Lost 187 LBS,"College was a major adjustment for me.

And within about a year, I had gained 180  lbs.

*“I  started having a lot of health issues,”  “My back was hurting all the  time. I had PCOS and I was on the spectrum for pre-diabetes and high  blood pressure. I love to ride horses — I have my entire life — and I  couldn’t anymore. I became super insecure and withdrawn, and I stopped  going out with my friends.”*

Meanwhile,  my mom and grandma were both following the weight loss program and I  had dropped 80 and 75  lbs., respectively. They had tried getting me on  board for years, and in Jan. 2018, after I finished college, I  finally  agreed to join the program. I  started setting alarms for every 2½-3  hours to remind myself to eat healthy snacks, and swapped out the pizza  for ones with cauliflower crust or made Taco Tuesdays with lettuce wraps  instead of tortillas.

Over the  next two and a half years, I consistently lost weight, eventually  dropping 187 lbs. I'm now a  health coach, and I help people ""get  healthy.""

After doing some research online, you tube, IG and talking to some friends that had success I got motivated to start. It was tough at first bc I my cravings were fighting me but I pushed thur. My first 3 weeks on Keto I lost 15lbs, I was instantly hooked. I did more research looked into simple meal ideas to do day to day, week to week. I ate the same meals a lot but I didn’t want to overwhelm myself. With my job I don’t have the luxury sometimes to prep with my schedule being erratic at times or just being too tired. Gradually things got easier, I figured out creative meals to put together that were cheap but were delicious to me and convenient. Jump to New Year’s Day I weigh 270 and this is where things got difficult bc my weigh didn’t budge beyond this point. Frustrating to say the least but I just stayed consistent kept doing what I was doing. I did switch up alittle with the things I ate to push past the plateau but I finally did it.

When I put my tongue outside, I can breath much better. Also, sides of my tongue is filled with teeth marks because it's too big for my mouth. I swear I am not making this up. It really sucks. 

Since we are afraid to go to the doctors, and they won't give a damn about you if you're not covid patient. So would keto fix this? I read about this, it's very rare problem but they say it might be related to hyptothroidism etc. Since keto would demolish those type of diseases, I think it would work. Please someone tell me it works, it's driving me nuts I can't breathe! I will force a doctor to make me a surgical operation to cut some of my tongue, for real. It's really bad..."
keto,Keto is the only thing that’s worked for me.,"Always struggled with my weight but keto is working. Hope this post is ok. I’m doing 1400 cals a day. 18g carbs max. Higher fat, lower protein. I was 255 even as measured on 1/20/21. I am down 13.1 pounds as of right now. I’m pumped."
keto,Trying keto was my best decision ever!,"I'm new here, (w, 53, German, 1,58 m/5’2) but I live ketogenic for almost five years. 

At first I only wanted to lose weight after trying one diet after another without long-term success. My main problem was craving from one day to another, it came out of the blue. Didn’t know that before. I always felt hungry, but I didn’t know why. This was new to me. I restricted calories, which wasn’t helpul, it was a horror. I tried everything, an experience, which I share with al lot of people here, I assume. Then there was the onset of menopause and other physical complaints such as rheumatism. I gained more and more weight in a very short time (30 kg/66 lbs in 4 month) and became more and more unhappy, in short: I was desperate, I was ill. I realized, something was completly out of order and I had no idea, how to fix it. 

One day, I randomly discovered an article on the ketogenic diet. That contradicted everything I thought I knew about nutrition until then. Is fat supposed to make you slim? That seemed really crazy to me. But after making some researchings on the internet and reading scientific books about low carbohydrate living I decided to give it a try - and haven't regret it to this day. 

Even if the beginning was difficult, keto flu, headaches, the whole program, I insisted on keto and after a short time I not only lost weight - it was much more important that my rheumatic pain disappeared completely in a very short time. I was able to sleep better and felt more productive, honestly I felt like I was reborn. 

And now, at 53, I'm healthier and fitter than I've ever been in my life. I haven't missed anything since realizing carbohydrates are toxic to me and that, for whatever reason, they make me sick. 

It took me almost 1 year to lose a total of 30 kg / 66 lbs - and although I eat more now than I used to, I have no problem maintaining my weight. I now also do a lot of sport, I run and I hike. Not because I have to, its more a kind of desire and I am sure, this has a lot to do with my way of eating. Keto seemed and seems to give me more energy right from the start. 

My biological age was recently estimated to be 38 years. ☺️

In my experience, keto is not a classic diet, keto is a new way of lifestyle. Maybe I can inspire others with my story to hold on. It is worth it!

Kind regards from Germany to all over the world! 🙋‍♀️"

keto,Help! I don't know what I'm doing wrong,"I've been on keto, pretty strictly, since Jan 1. I didn't weigh myself until Mid-Jan, and have been weighing myself and checking my measurements every 10 days since then. I do feel like I've been doing everything by the book, intermittent fasting, my macros hit the right spot every day, I'm at a calorie deficit, and I even starting working out in February (going on 2.5 mile walks, body weight stuff only). Since the first measurement that I took, nothing has really happened. My bust went down, but nothing else did, including my weight, (except for 2 pounds) for the last 40 days. Honestly I'm just really frustrated lol and need help understanding what I can do to make the scale/my measurements move, and understanding what I'm doing wrong."
keto,For veteran keto-ers: How and how long have you maintained at your goal weight?,"&amp;#x200B;

I've committed to my current diet for the next 2 years or so, but would like to eat at 50-75g of carbs/day eventually as my long-term WOE (fruits &amp; veggie carbs) after those 2 years. Just wondering to hear the experiences of people who keep the weight off - did you stay keto at 20g or less forever, or has being fat adapted made your carb tolerance a little higher? have you ever messed around with eating healthy at maintenance without keto?"
keto,"Eat simpler, and keto is not hard!","I see so many people either getting bored with food or thinking it's hard to find low-carb options.

My opinion is that people in today's society are so programmed to:

1) Want WAY too much variety and flavors in each meal

2) Want something unique for each meal

I've lost about 40 pounds on keto and the key to my success is no doubt saying ""NO"" to all the packaged options and training myself to eat simpler.

That means I cook everything myself from scratch.

I often cook in bulk and eat the same meal for 3-4 days in a row. 

I often cook one thing and eat it as a meal. For instance yesterday I made scallops in butter. That's it. Then I ate a handful of nuts and cheese.

I usually ""deconstruct"" meals in this way by eating meat, and then 2 hours later I'll eat broccoli or something instead of having them together on one plate.

To me, eating 95% whole foods with salt/pepper and being satisfied without feeling deprived is one of the only ways to make it sustainable.

Of course, I enjoy a good cauliflower pizza or keto dessert every now and then, but I'm happy with any single ingredient meal as long as it's quality and cooked the right way."
keto,"Always remember to check the *actual* amount of carbs, rather than just the net carbs.","I've been trying to go Keto and I thought that I was doing pretty well--keeping my carb intake to (what I thought was) under 50 grams and planning out meals, that kinda stuff.  I thought that I wasn't losing weight purely because I had the misfortune of being someone who would go through the process slowly.

Nope.

As it turns out, the snack that I've been having has 7g carbs instead of 2g.  I've always been in the forties, so that means that most times that I had that snack, I went over 50g."

keto,I have lived on 1200 calories for the entirety of February and I have gained 4kg. How is this possible?,"I know in the FAQ it says to avoid making posts about plateaus and weight gain but I feel my weight gain is so bizarre that I need to make a post. I hope the mods and anyone who reads understands.

Let me start from the beginning. I started strict Keto on the 14th of January this year and I weighed 135kg and started with eating 1300ish calories a day with 20:4 intermittent fasting. I did this cold turkey with no problems and luckily no keto flu or anything. After 2 weeks, I weighed myself and I was down to 129kg and thought awesome, this is going great!

Since the beginning of February, I have dropped down to 1200 calories a day with no cravings or problems etc. but I decide to weigh myself today and somehow, I'm up to 133kg...

As already mentioned, I know that plateaus and occasional weight gain is possible even when dieting as mentioned in the FAQ but how in the seven hells did I gain 4kg since the previous time I weighed myself?

According to the BMR section in the keto macro calculator, my BMR is 2065 calories and I'm only eating 1200 calories a day so I am at a loss for how I have gained so much weight.

I have looked through the entirety of the FAQ and I have Googled and I have not found an answer. Does anyone have a possible explanation? Thanks for your time"
keto,Lost nothing since the initial water weight after 6 weeks. Feel like giving up..,"Hello all, it’s going to be a lot whining so I apologise ahead and ask you to bear with me. It’s been exactly 6 weeks since I started. I lost around 3kg water weight but nothing else happened since then. I keep jumping between 60 ~ 61kg

I get the “being patient” but seeing no changes in 6 weeks, I kinda have enough of it. If I have to wait 3 months to finally start seeing some results, it will drive me crazy. I don’t think I can do anything more correctly than what I’m currently doing. And if this is not for me, I want to wish you guys good luck and find another path. So I really need some honesty right now before I trow this body in the trash bin. 

160cm, 24F, 60~61kg

1200kcal, IF 18:6

Carbs 20gr max

Protein 110gr min

Fat 75gr max

Using a food scale religiously for every meal and anything I consume. I stick to it to the gram. I sometimes go over my protein but eat less fat to hit 1200kcal. Never go over carbs or fat. I’m drinking at least 2L water a day.

This is what my diet looks like:

Breakfast: 2 eggs + 2 egg whites, half an big avocado (80~90g) OR 40g white cheese, sometimes 50gr tomato or paprika.

Lunch: either yogurt + protein powder + nuts/seeds OR tuna salad with homemade mayo on lettuce.

Dinner: around 200gr meat (Chicken, beef, turkey or fish) and brocolli OR a green salad with olive oil and lemon juice.

Snack: a handful of nuts (like 8-10 almonds) OR a few pieces of 80% chocolate. 

Electrolytes: 400mg magnesium tablets, 2000mg potassium from Lo salt and sodium from table salt. 

This all comes to 1200 kcal, max 20g carbs, min 110g protein and max 75g fat. I measure everything to the drop with a food scale so no wrong measurements and sneaky carbs here! I seriously don’t eat a single gram more of something than I’m allowed. Also don’t use sweetners or pre packaged stuff except for yogurt and my protein powder and the occasional 80% chocolate. Don’t have a dairy intolerance either! 

I also haven’t experienced any other benefits. I’m still fatigued, still low mood, haven’t experienced the clear mind and focus and I still crave sugar although I’ve always been good at saying no when I’m on a diet."

keto,Hitting a wall,"I've been on keto with 16:8 intermittent fasting almost 2 months and initially weight came off pretty good.Ive been running a 5k a day as well mixing it in with longer runs. 10k half marathons etc.I don't lift every day but I get in squats deadlifts pull ups abs bench press 2-3 days a week

I feel like I hit the legendary wall.I still am doughy af and this diet is supposed to burn fat.I just want to take it to the next level.My effort has still been high.I shoveled the snow on my whole street(12-15inches)the other day for 2 and a half hours just for the exercise.

I'm looking for tips on how to keep this body burning fat if anyone knows any tips to get my ass to the next level and off this plateau I'd appreciate it."
keto,"Please, DO NOT DRINK YOUR SALTS ALL AT ONCE— PLAN AHEAD.","So. This evening I laid down for sleep and noticed some classic low potassium symptoms— minor heart palpitations enough to keep me from falling asleep. I rolled out of bed and grabbed my bottle of potassium chloride. I spooned a 3/4 teaspoon (around 1750 mg) into a glass of water, drank it, waited 45 minutes, and saw no improvement. I did it again, taking another 1750 mg. Waited 45 minutes. Little improvement. By now I was getting frustrated. What the heck was going on??

Bear in mind that I am exhausted, ready for some sleep, knowing how important sleep is to facilitate weight loss and general health. It’s getting annoying. 

I take another 1750 and BAM, the effects hit me like a truck. My fingers and tongue and throat went numb, I broke out into a frigid cold sweat, diarrhea ensued, and when I walked to the bathroom, my muscles were so weak my limbs felt like lead. 

I took to Dr. Google to see what the symptoms of excess potassium were, and there they were. Flush it from your system, it said, drink some water. So I did: 2 liters worth. 

I watched my symptoms like a hawk, and three hours later I’m no longer sweating. The feeling is returning to my lips and fingertips, and I’m slowly removing it from my system. Not going anywhere near my potassium for a little bit. 

So— be careful! Hyperkalemia (too much potassium in the blood) can be life-threatening, it can trigger heart attacks. Drink your salts throughout the day, not all at once like I did."

keto,An interesting scale victory,"Keto has seemingly blown my mind at every opportunity. I started keto at the end of July 2020. I was a 290 lbs male at 6’6” at the time. 

I set my goal weight to 220, since that was what I reckoned my college weight was. Imagine my surprise when I am parsing through some old medical records listing my college weight around 240. 

Friends, I was at 237 when I read that, and it blew my mind. And my weight is still cruising downward. I admit I had to process the fact I had essentially cruised past a major goal. 

I have recently started 16:8 IF and getting more intentional about tracking calories, since I was in a long stall. So this whole thing blew my mind. 50 lbs lost and below college weight and closing in on 55 down! Nuts!

It is interesting though because I am realizing how poor my self image was before keto. I keep expecting to turn back into my college self, but the person I see in the mirror is not even close. His face and body is much more healthy but still strangely unrecognizable to me. I guess I just really hated seeing myself in the mirror when I was so big. Anyone else wrestle with that?"
keto,Help: Keto and voice-acting,"Hi all!

To start with, I'm 23F from India, been on keto for close to 2 years now. Have had great success on it, lost over 132 lbs and am feeling amazing. I also took up voice-acting/dubbing about a year ago and have been exploring it for a good while now. 

The only concern I have right now is that I get these weird glitch noises/tongue clicks/pop sounds as my mouth is either too dry or excessively salivating (both extremes that are detrimental for a voice artist). I end up doing too make retakes and even had to redub an entire project due to these click/lip noises. I have used a pop filter but despite that the mouth noises continue. 😒

I also read a repost by an experienced voiceactor on r/voiceacting where he compared the effects of LCHF diets on voice. He had addressed the increasing wetness due to higher fat consumption. 

Besides these click sounds, my stomach makes these weird gurgling, rambling noises at random times (even when am not hungry) and it makes me super insecure. 

At first thought, I assumed I'm dehydrated and decided to up my water intake and I am monitoring my potassium intake as well. Hopefully that will fix my dry mouth. 

But is there anything I could do to reduce those wet noises whenever my mouth salivates too much and for the weird noises my stomach makes. ☹️ I do not want to give up keto if I could fix these someway, because keto is the best thing that ever happened to me."
keto,How much calorie counting do you do?,"I’ve been eating keto since New Years and while I have definitely enjoyed it so far and I have seen some slight weight loss, I’m wondering how much calorie counting you guys still do?

keto,Fasting Blood Glucose Test Issued by Doctor - Keto or SAD?,"I posted this in AskDocs as well, but thought someone here might know.

Hi, I should have asked my doctor when she ordered the test but forgot. Doctor ordered a routine fasting glucose test after a previous pre-diabetic level result a few years ago. My mom had diabetes so I get tested every year or so.

I eat very low carb, generally ketogenic. I have done so for years, aside from the multiple times I have fallen off the wagon. Every other glucose test was in the normal range (though the high end of normal) because I was getting tested while eating very low carb. One time a few years ago, I read on the lab website that I was supposed to eat moderate carbs the day before. I used this as an excuse to go on a junk food binge, and my result was in the pre-diabetic range. Every other test I've taken before and since, has been normal... but I've also been eating very low carb every other time I've been tested.

Consequently, I don't know if I'm really pre-diabetic and masking it with low carb, or if it was because I binged on chips and ice cream the night before the test. I'm wondering if it's important to see how my blood sugar behaves if I really do eat a moderate amount of carbs, rather than keto or crazy binge. I'd prefer to just stay on my regular keto plan, because I tend to fall off the wagon and quickly gain weight if I'm not super strict. But are we missing important information if I stick to very low carb eating before the test?

TL;DR - I normally eat a keto diet, is it advisable to eat a standard diet the day before a fasted glucose test to get more accurate results?

Thank you!"

keto,Carb Tapering,Hello all! I started doing keto about 9 months ago. Did strict keto for about 3 months and then switched to a very Low carb diet but not low enough for ketosis. I saw immediate and noticeable benefits when starting. I got leaner but actually increased my strength and looked harder than in the past. (I was already fit when I started doing cardio or resistance training 6 days a week) I also noticed much less joint and back pain. No more waking up stiff and sore! But honestly after 3 months in ketosis with only 2 cheat meals I couldn't do it anymore and switched to low carb...no more than 75g a day. So still a very restricted diet for another 6 months. Which brings me to the current date. I've been eating whatever I want for 2 weeks. All the things I've not allowed myself to have for all this time is fair game; and I'm kinda loving it! But...im softening up already and the inflammation kicked in after the 1st week so I'm stiff and sore every morning and having back issues again. I plan to begin strict keto again on the 1st. My question is can I taper my carbs down over the next 10 days and avoid the terrible brain fog and energy loss that comes with that first week?
keto,Water weight increased since being keto?,"I started keto in October, and bought a smart scale (weight guru) to track how my body fat is trending.

However I’m doubting now that I can even trust these at all, as it shows my water weight before keto hovered around 51% and now is consistently around 56%.

keto,Type 2 Diabetes / Cholesterol / Statins,"Hello. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a few years back, but thanks to Keto, I can lower my a1c to 5.7 - 5.8 range (no medication). My doctor, though, is not too happy with my Lipid profile, and he wants me to start on low-dose Statins. My last Cholesterol test from a couple of weeks ago: 

Total: 216 mg/dL

Trig: 50 mg/dL

HDL: 71 mg/dL

LDL: 135 mg/dL

My doctor wants to bring down the LDL to around 100. And he thinks because I've been diagnosed with a Diabetes 2, low-dose Statin is beneficial in my case. My doctor agrees that my Lipid profile is not that bad for a non-diabetic person, but because I'm a diabetic, Statins is strongly recommended.

However, I’m going on a ski trip next weekend and I don’t think it’ll be very easy to maintain the diet while I’m with a bunch of college friends in a cabin. My question is how much can I expect to backslide after taking a weekend off? I’m obviously not going to go wild and start eating whatever I want, but I think it’s inevitable I’ll be knocked out of ketosis. Just wanted to get an idea of what to expect or any experience anyone might have. Thanks!"

keto,A message to all the female ketonians....men keep scrolling,"Phew, now that they're gone! Girls, I have had recurring yeast infections/BV for YEARS. I've been on keto since January 4 and not only do I feel amazing BUT I went to the doctor for my annual yesterday and it was the first time in almost three years that I didn't leave the office for a script for some cream, pill or some other nonsense.

keto,Unexpected positive effects of Keto. Wondering if I should take my 2yr daughter off wheat.,"I’m a 39F and I’ve been doing keto for just over 3 weeks and I’ve noticed two great things since being on it aside from the weight loss. For the first time in years I can breathe through both nostrils! It only occurred to me the other day that I was even doing this. For as long as I can remember I’ve only been able to breathe through one nostril at a time and the other one would be stuffed up. My Dr even prescribed me a 3 month dose of steroid nasal spray that didn’t work. Keto appears to have sorted the problem within weeks. I also noticed that over the past few years I have been losing A LOT of hair when I wash it, but today I didn’t lose nearly as much. I don’t know if this is down to Keto or the supplements I started taking but either way I’m not losing as much hair and I’m so happy. 

Anyways my question is this - my 2.5yr is constantly stuffed up. Not with a cold but just nasal stuffed up. So much so it’s affecting her speech and she cannot pronounce her words. The staff at her nursery have mentioned that I should take her to an ENT specialist. I’m wondering if I should try eliminating wheat from her diet (this will be hard for her since she loves bread and crackers). Would gluten free work as a switch?

Has anyone else experienced good results like this when eliminating wheat from their diet or their children’s diet?"

keto,Health Update - 3 wins out of 4!!!,"I am a LADA Diabetic (Type I and II).  In Sept 2020 my A1c was 11.2 and I weighed in at 226 lbs with a bp of 143/71.  Started a modified Keto 1/3/21.  Just got back from my Endo appointment.  A1c is 7.8.  I weighed in at 215 (even while wearing 3 layers of clothes and w/snowboots on).  Unfortunately, my bp went up to 186/94.  2 wins out of 3 today.  Yay!  I'm pretty certain the higher bp is the result of higher amounts of sodium.  Literally went from 1200 mg to approx 3000 mg a day.  So, I will have to do some testing to figure out a way to get the sodium intake down again.  BUT am so very happy.  ALSO had a cholesterol test done recently and it's still in the perfect zones.    That makes 3 wins so far this month!"
keto,"Eating great, no change, type 2","I've been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for several years. I have PCOS as well. 

I was on metformin for years on and off. I'd stop taking it because of the side effects or money/insurance.

2 years ago I was put on extended release metformin and my a1c reacted well with only moderate diet changes. I had plenty of bad meals but it was never very difficult to keep things in check.

I stopped taking it 8 months ago because of a recall over carcinogens.

Pandemic stress had me eating like GARBAGE at the same time. The week before Christmas, I decided to check my glucose for the first time in almost a year.

It was 235. That is higher than I've ever been!

I immediately cut out bad food. I have been eating very low carb (meat, veggies, cheese only) since then. Not a single cheat meal since The day after Christmas.  For the last two weeks I've been cutting out red meat as well and limiting dairy a bit.

My fasting level is always over 200 when I wake up. Other readings throughout the day are never under 160. 

I have an appointment to get my a1c checked so they can put me on medication again. But...

This isn't normal for me. I would usually have lost some weight by now and had better readings. Nothing is budging at all. I haven't lost a single pound. I'm obese. 264 at 5'4. So the weight usually comes off pretty quickly when I eat even  half as well.

There are no sneaky carbs in my diet.

I am on medication for other things but I've been on this medication for years.


I feel totally fine, though?

Any advice? Is this abnormal? I have a lot of health anxiety so I'm terrified I have cancer or something that's keeping my glucose elevated."

* Omega 3 (500EPA, 250DHA)

And these every 3 days:

* Vitamin D3 (10,000 IU)
* Vitamin K2 (100mcg)
* Zinc Picolinate (50mg)

keto,Unexplained weird plateau..,"Hello, i am a 22 years male, my height is 178cm and weigh 125kg(275lbs). I have restricted my diet for 4-4.5 months now(lost 4kg i think) and started keto \~2months ago(lost 8-10kg).

I have lost most of it during a \~2 weeks keto diet (2/3kg might have been the water weight i guess ?) \~2 during a week and \~1.5 during 5 days.

The problem, is that i spent all three (non sequential) periods when i went back to the family home(i am a student) but when i was alone(that is 3/4 weeks i guess) i didn't lose anything and my weight fluctuated(i know, don't trust the scale) even though i literally didn't change my diet... I am literally eating the same things since in both cases my mother is preparing the same food whether i'm at home or i take it with me(the only difference might be tomatoes i guess). I don't change my physical activity either, i'm more ""active"" while living alone in any case...

Could the ""environment"" somehow affect weight loss ??"

keto,What veggies to eat on keto?,Hi everyone I’m a little confused here. I’m currently doing omad and keto. I keep seeing conflicting information on eating too much fat and not getting enough potassium on the diet which could possibly lead to a fatty liver? But at the same time I keep hearing about oxalates and how damaging they can be to your system. What veggies are good to eat on keto? I see some people go completely carnivore. Could someone explain? Thank you!
keto,"Male, 30 years old and one month Keto - No longer Obese!","I'm no stranger to low/slow carb diets.  My diet of choice is Paleo for the health benefits. Paleo works phenomenally for me - but is difficult to follow for those of us short on time.  Due to a combination of life happening and many repeated poor choices, I've let myself go.  On January 20th, I decided to give Keto a shot, the diet is easier to follow and I've broken one too many buttons off my pants.

Unlike most of you, I've taken an unorthodox approach to Keto.  I don't weigh my food, I don't track my macros or caloric intake.  I do believe this is the best and most scientific approach to keto, but... I just can't be arsed to do it.  I'm setting this diet up to be successful and frankly... that sort of weighing and tracking will lead to my failure.

What else have I done that's out of the ordinary?  I'm glad you asked!  I didn't take a starting weight.  This is anecdotal, but when starting a diet, if I take my initial weigh in, set my goals, and I tend to fail within a week or two.  This time, I didn't do my initial weigh in until the 10th day after starting Keto where I weighed in at 219.2 lbs.  

Since then, I have been religiously weighing myself in the morning, missing a single day.  I understand that these data are highly variable and we have daily and hourly fluctuations in weight, but data is my fetish.  I've added these data to an excel table.  After a week, I charted my progress and inserted trendlines forecasting future weight loss.  Notably, skipping weigh in for the first week didn't screw up my trendline with the loss of bloat weight.  After a couple weeks, I added a comparison column for the day's progress compared to the week prior.  Recently, for kicks I've added a daily change value to see if there are  any specific days which are particularly bad for me, none to report so far.  The daily weigh in process is very important for me, as it does what tracking food does for many people - it holds me accountable with what I eat.

My final oddity - my body naturally does 16/8 or 15/9 IF.  I don't do mornings well, so I don't do breakfast.  With Keto, I'm not really hungry around lunch either, so my IF has trended toward  \~ 23/1 or 22/2 lately.  If I do eat lunch, it's a small meal - 1/2 to 1/3 what I normally eat, then the other 1/2 to 1/3 of the meal would be my dinner.  If I don't eat lunch, I'm usually at 2/3 my usual dinner (my normal dinner and no snacking or a smaller dinner and light snacking on nuts and/or fruit).  

To put you troopers who've read this far out of their misery, today I weighed in at 211.4.  At 5'10.5"", this puts my BMI at 29.9 - just inside the ""overweight"" category.  While I hate BMI and I don't fit the curve well (I don't power lift anymore, but I've still got a decent amount of muscle mass), it's still an fun milestone.  I've lost 7.8 pounds in the 3 weeks I've been tracking my weight, good for 2.6 pounds per week.  My linear trendline has me losing 1.95 pounds per week - if this holds true, my milestones will be: 

* Onderland in the first week of April (mid March if the 2.6 pounds holds true)
* 175 by the end of June (end of May if the 2.6 pounds holds - it won't)
* 160 (goal weight) by the end of August (early July if I get off my fat ass and decide to exercise)

Based on these numbers, I estimate my starting weight was 225 (2.6 pounds of body weight, 3.2 pounds of bloat), meaning that I've lost just under 15 pounds in my first month on the Keto diet.

keto,Crispy Fried Salmon Skin is Effing Delicious!,"The other night I was searing salmon (wild caught Atlantic from Costco) with the skin on. I have a cast iron griddle that I put over two gas burners when searing lots of meat. The skin stuck a little and peeled off the salmon on one of the filets. On a whim, I flipped it over and just kept pan frying it in olive oil. When it got nice and crispy, I sprinkled a little sea salt on it and gave it a bite. I was blown away. I actually peeled the skin off the rest of the filets that would have gone in the trash (my wife and kids won’t touch it) and fried it up the same way. 

It’s almost like pork rinds but not as thick and I think the flavor is better. Anyone else try this?

I’ll take pics next time."
keto,Keto gout Uris acid flare ups,"Hey all,

I know there are a ton of articles but I still feel the need to post.

I started keto 2 months ago and it’s been going well but I am seeing heavy flare ups in my toes and severe pains

I have never had this before so I doubt I’m prone to it.

My diet is typically red meats with veggies for dinners. 
Snack is usually meat and cheese and nuts
Breakfast is always bacon, eggs, spinach, cheese.

So, how do I lower my Uric acid levels to stay with keto? I am doing the following:
1) vitamin C pills
2) potassium salt
3) potassium pills
4) tons of water with some lemon juice and apple cider vinegar
5) some veggies, probably not enough.
6) putting cortisone in my foot for pain

Any other suggestions?"
keto,Anyone else feel..blah?,"It’s not a very descriptive word, but I truly feel blah!

I had blood work &amp; my ketones are 10 when normal reading is negative. So I’m in ketosis for sure. I’ve been keeping carbs under 20. 
Any ideas??"
keto,I've been doing keto for just over a month in the weight loss has stopped. Am I doing something wrong?,"I've been pretty diligent about eating right, the keto way.  The only sugars I have would be incidental and may amount to less than 5 grams per day, IF THAT. As for Carbs...I am definitely staying under 20 grams daily.  I walk or run most days and practice intermittent fasting most days of the week.  

In the first month I lost 12 lbs But since then, the last 10 days or so,  I have stayed at that same weight. Have not lost a pound since.  The only reason I could think of is that I may be eating too much.  In other words, while sticking to the rules of the ketonic diet, I may be eating too often, piling on the calories after 1 PM. 

Thoughts?  Suggestions?"

I used a keto calculator which told me i need to hit 1908 calories, 162g fat, 90g protein and stay under 20g carbs, i made a meal plan for myself based on that which didn't hit those goals as I'm new to all of this and dyslexic so trying to do this myself has been an absolute headache, I've posted multiple times trying to get assistance and never gave gotten the assistance i need and researching it myself is stressing me out, I don't want variety or different meals each day as i work a lot and i never stick to a diet if i do it that way, i want to eat the same 3 meals every day (or 2 meals per day) but i want to make sure I'm hitting my macros, counting them myself has been making my diet more work than it should be, for the last week this has been my diet

Breakfast: 2 eggs scrambled, 3 slices of bacon.
Skip lunch.
Dinner: 1 Chicken Breast grilled, 80g steamed broccoli, parmesan cheese &amp; butter.

now i know that doesn't hit my macros, I'm aware i should change to chicken thighs, and more chicken and veg etc, but I'm not sure exactly what to add and what to eat more of or what to add to my breakfast and thats what i really need, i don't really want to change what I'm eating just adjust it so I'm in ketosis, i don't struggle to stay on a diet and the same flavours every day doesn't bother me at all, its the stress of trying to do it all by myself thats made me break my diet a few times and that I'm starving, I'm basically looking for someone to take the diet I've said and tell me how to change it so its definitely keto, I'm not super into batch cooking at the weekend as i have time to cook at work just nothing complex, i don't mind adding snacks either and I'm drinking way over my daily water amount, I've posted similarly in other keto/diet forums or subreddits and only ever been told to switch to chicken thighs or not to starve myself, but never had any real help, i don't need a free nutritionist or anything just some assistance from someone who knows keto, if you could help me out let me know, I'd like to get started on a proper keto diet asap, thanks for any advice."
keto,Little Victories,"39 M - 212 lbs - Goal of 198 lb

I started Keto in early January at a starting weight of 230 lbs. It was very easy to get pulled into the Keto diet routine, as the initial weight loss was significant. I probably lost 10 lbs in 2 weeks. I knew a significant portion was water, but it made me want to work even harder. Now, here I am, 45 days in, and it doesn't feel like work anymore. I'm continuing to find some great keto food options, and have found the perfect solution for my pizza cravings. 

The weight is now coming off a bit slower, but embracing this as a lifestyle, any positive direction keeps the motivation high.

I absolutely recommend buying a scale that can convert all of your metrics directly to your phone. At the risk of people calling me out for pushing a specific product, there are a few good ones on the market, and one, in particular, that has held me accountable. Feel free to DM me if you need the information.

keto,"[Help] Issues with Keto Calculators concerning protein values, also calories","I am confused about the results of keto calculators. I've used the ankerl one forever, but I had difficulties with the macros. When compared to other, random Keto Calculators found around the web, the results of ankerl were always a lot lower in protein and generally lower calories at a generic 20% deficit setting (for testing purposes, personally, I prefer 10-15% deficit for weight loss), which usually affects the fat makro. 

I also noticed a wide spread in calculated protein values across all major calculators found on google. Aside from that, I've read everything from 0.5g/kg to 1.5g/kg if you are not actively doing sports, with above 2.0g/kg recommended if you do 2h/sports daily.

Now I noticed getting ""protein hunger attacks"", which I always manage somehow by ignoring them, but my SO does get them, too - also with makros from ankerl. The calculo values are a lot higher in protein and lower in fat using identical values, (97g ankerl, 128g calculo). Also, typing in the values of either ankerl or calculo into FDDB (food tracker) results in a mismatch in calculated calories by the food tracker app. 

Now I am VERY unsure which values I should trust. I failed Keto for over a year by foolishly ignoring tracking and not noticing a way too high protein intake. Switched to tracking 6 weeks ago, noticed protein hunger but also proper weight loss. 

What am I overlooking? Which calculator should I trust and by what settings?

I'm really sorry if this is a dumb question and am ready for the downvotes, as long as someone can please help me understand this issue I'm having."

keto,Carb cycling vs strict Keto (Sorry people),"I know this topic is beaten to death but I'm looking for very specific experience.

For a bit of background, I have done Keto over 1.5 years, almost two years, had a ton of success gaining strength and staying lean, mood benefits, etc.

Recently I was feeling a new kind of run down and felt myself craving carbs exceptionally. Decided to try something new and did a huge carb load and now I feel much more energetic and focused today.

So I have decided in the future to carb load at least once a week. Years ago I had a lot of success with the LeanGains protocol which involves 3x week carb loads sorrounding training. Obviously this would mean I'm not going to be Keto adapted anymore.

For those of you who have done this, you probably know what I know also, which is that the feeling itself is unlikely to last, and the more carbs I eat and as genetic changes happen, I'll probably feel worse.

Based on my experience though, I am certain that a carb refeed at least every two weeks would be very beneficial, so this is good.

For planning my program, I need to decide between 3x week, 1x week, or 1x bi-weekly to start with. 

For financial reasons I'd REALLY like to be able to do 3x week high carb, but I have a feeling that's not going to work. I know I'll have to experiment.

So after reading that you can see what I'm dealing with hopefully! I'm looking for experience and feedback from anyone else who has gotten to this specific point - doing keto long term and then deciding to implement carb cycling - did carbs eventually make you feel awful? How often did you implement the refeeds?

I know it's a question that gets asked a lot I wanted to ask it again with my specific context in mind incase I'm missing something. 

Thanks for anyone taking the time to read/respond."
keto,I’m on the struggle bus.,"Been keto a year, this month. Lost 30 lbs, super happy with it. I’m only 15 lbs from my goal weight, and my weight loss has stalled for a couple months now. I haven’t been eating the best nor have I been working out since everything under the sun is shut down, and I have lost all motivation for home workouts between school, kids, and work. I have been falling in and out of ketosis for a month now and I think I have pinpointed why - I’m so fucking bored with the food that I end up eating something else. I know that sounds awful considering what I get to eat but it seems so mundane and unexciting anymore. I’m not really sure what I need to do in order to change this mindset but I’m over it and don’t feel the motivation I used to, maybe because I’m snowed in with my kids and dogs and feel like I’m on a hamster wheel. Wondering if anyone has hit this wall and what they’ve done to overcome it? Obviously trying new foods would be ideal but chances are 100% I’m not going to go follow 30 ingredient recipes, ever. I generally stick with whole food products. Send help!"
keto,Iodine free protein,"Hi everyone! I’ve been trying to supplement my diet with protein, because I’m not eating much these days, but I’ve noticed that many shakes and powders are 15-35% iodine!

Does anyone have any ideas on good protein supplements that either are low on the list or free completely?"
keto,Stalled...and frustrated.,"Background - 50 years old. 5'11"".  I started doing keto 10 years ago. I was at 220 lbs and got down to 170 within a year. I have maintained that weight for the last 10 years, fluctuating no more than 5 lbs either direction. And I've kept this weight even while going out drinking multiple times per week and having a couple cheat meals each week.

With the pandemic, we moved out of our downtown apartment (walking distance to bars) to a house a few miles away. So we only go out drinking 1x a week and I only drink my normal vodka with Mio.

I'm honestly cooking my keto meals at home, almost zero cheats meals yet my weight is now floating closer to 190 lbs.

I used to gain 5-8 lbs after a weekend of drinking, only to drop those pounds by avoiding drinking and eating strict keto for a few days. Now nothing I do seems to drop those pounds. 

My foods have not changed, I still exercise the same amount as before, yet here I am with these extra pounds.

Frustrated..."
keto,Having trouble gaining muscle on keto,"Looking for some opinions here. I have been doing keto for about 8 months (44yo male), and love it. Starting weight was 280, down to 210 as of this morning. During that time i have lost about 8 lbs of muscle mass (according to biometric scale), which is pretty low percentage when compared to fat lost. I average about 1.5 lb/wk, so no complaints there.
...
Question: what has been others experience in gaining muscle while on keto?
...
I work out 4x per week, and eat 1.0g/lb of lean body mass (most days i go slightly over that, but never on calories) and calculate macros every two weeks. I really can’t work out more due to other obligations in life, so i am trying to figure out what i am doing wrong. HELP."
keto,Why/how is keto healthy?,"Bear with me here. I'm not a total newb, but I genuinely don't understand why people say that keto is healthy. I understand that weight loss is for most people healthy, but is that all it is? I'm not saying I believe keto is unhealthy, but I feel like my diet pre-keto was definitely healthier. Help me understand.

  
Plus, I'm not losing weight, so I'm a bit puzzled about that."
keto,Any new must have “keto” products released the past year or so?,"I do 99% of the grocery shopping and BF has decided to swing back to keto.

Is there anything low carb that’s new and a must have?"

keto,Keto chocolate ganache tart with pecan and dried cranberries — Steemit," 

I love sugar free chocolate tart, especially with a cup of coffee or tea in the afternoon. Now when it’s cold outside, a great book and a piece of this delicious low carb chocolate ganache tart are so comforting and heartwarming.

However, this keto chocolate tart with pecan nuts and dried cranberries is delicious during the summer heat too, especially when cold straight from the fridge."
keto,"Extreme lethargy and sleepiness after meal. Carbs are low, electrolytes are good, ketones good too, fourth week.","I'm on my fourth week of kd, not for weight loss, and it was good so far. I had more energy, better concentration and was more productive in general. I'm doing one meal a day, because it's more convenient and takes less time.

Today I had 400g of chicken, 200g of spinach and 170g of butter. After 30 minutes or so after a meal I started to feel very fatigued and sleepy, so I get to sleep for 20 or so minutes. 

After awaking I checked my urine ketones level, and it was very good: 4+. I'm still not sure, what was the cause of that crash, and what can I do, to prevent it in the future. I'm tracking my electrolytes, tracking carbs very carefully and doing clean keto in general."
keto,NSV - a blood test success story,"Background: started Keto one year ago after getting high numbers all around and talk of diabetes. 

2020 numbers: 300lbs, total cholesterol: 171, hdl: 34, trig: 163, ldl: 109, hdlc ratio: 5.0, non: hdl 137, glucose: 110

2021 numbers: 203lbs, total cholesterol: 190, hdl: 45, trig: 67, ldl: 129, hdlc ratio 4.2, non hdl: 145, glucose: 95, a1c: 5.1

I started keto as soon as the D word came up. Was strict keto, measuring, weighing and logging every crumb, until about July and have been doing lazy keto since and continued to lose. Since the fall I’ve been maintaining my weigh loss with lazy keto and minimal exercise. I was in full swing as the gym before keto and up until everything closed down, and got really into cycling as a result. Now with a Chicago winter and no desire to go into a gym,  I’ve been very stagnant with exercise and just had a hernia repair a week ago so minimal movement for the next month. I’m planning on ramping back up to get to my goal of 180lbs by summer. These test results are very motivating. 

I do enjoy fried chicken as a cheat meal from time to time, but generally stay between probably 20-50g carbs depending on how much you believe the “keto” food labels. Aunt Millies carb smart bread, Costco keto bread, la banderita carb counter shells, and Costco low carb protein bars all seem to have questions to their low carb validity but they’ve been instrumental in my maintenance.  I do also allow myself a bit of rebel ice cream too. 

I do wonder about getting my total cholesterol down though. My doc suggested fish oil, which I already take, and CoQ10. I know the numbers overall are ok,  but always room for improvement.

Thanks a lot to this sub for your guidance and help over the last year."
keto,3 months 100% keto and now I’m craving carbs!!,"I’ve dropped a ton of weight, been feeling great, not craved carbs at all really but the last couple days are a drag!

keto,"Returning to Keto, lost 65 pounds, gained 15 back","Back in 2019 I finally hit the rubber to the road and lost 65 pounds, starting at 210 to 145 lbs in about 8 months. 

I've been honestly doing really well with maintaining up until this past holiday season where I let myself indulge like the whole month. The. Whole. Month. Now I'm 160 ish and hate it. 

I've been trying to get myself pumped back up to get into it again and have written out some of my favorite keto meals:

Breakfast
- cheesy eggs and bacon/sausage
- plain Greek yogurt w/ honey and granola, fruit 
- protein bar 
- smoothie 

Lunch
- salad
- roasted cauliflower 
- healthy snack plate (fruit, veggies, cheese)

Dinner 
- salsa chicken
- taco bowl 
- salad
- taco soup
- bean soup
- steak and green beans  

Treats
- dark chocolate square
- almond flour mug cake 
- chocolate strawberries 

I'm sort of a picky eater so I find that keto, although it works WONDERS for me, can be tough mentally. 

Also this pandemic has restarted the depression I worked so hard to escape the first time around and I know that's part of my struggle rn.

Any meal ideas or general supportive tips and tricks? I'd add a progress pic but my app isnt letting me for some reason. Thanks in advance 💜"
keto,Steady Progress and Daily Discipline,"I'm in the beginning of the third week of being back on track. My movement on and off that track over the past few years has been erratic. I'm going to write a longer post documenting that expirience and what I've learned, but for now:

I've been practicing OMAD (one meal a day) and a borderline carnivorous way of eating since February 1st.

My weight loss so far has been:

Feb 1st - 215. 2
Feb 8th - 206.2
Feb 15th 203.4

The first week clearly had a lot of water weight lost. It's the difference between the 8th and 15th that at first disappointed me but uppon further reflection motivate me greatly.

One can only lose weight so fast. I had hoped to be under 200 (an arbitrary but meaningful milestone) by the 15th.

This was not realistic.

Somewhere around 2.5-3.5 pounds lost a week. 
That's realistic. 
Thats what I achieved in the last week.
That's Steady Progress. 

I have never been in great shape. Never had abbs. Never felt truly comfortable in my skin. I want these things. And unfortunately, I want them now. 

It is so easy to give in to despair. To go back to old habits. To give up on what I want. And so I commit myself every morning with conviction to reach for what I want in life. 

It takes daily, hourly, momentary, discipline. 

I write partially for catharsis and partially to hopefully help others on this journey. 

I'll end with this: 

Sacrifice the fleeting pleasure of the now for the future you want. 
Commit yourself daily. 
Stay the course."

The brand is Caulipower. Each box has two crusts and servings are 1/3 of the crust. I don't want to offend her by saying I can't eat them, and honestly even on the deal they weren't cheap.

TLDR: Heavy Coffee Drinker. Dehdyration/electrolyte imbalance sent me to the ER. 2 Lactate Ringers after- feels like i got a brand new lease on life. Doc said Keto is okay- just watch my electrolytes. had to kick myself out of Ketosis ( AT LEAST ITS ON MY OWN TERMS) but coming back after. Now I know even better so im gonna do better. 


 thought I was drinking enough ketoaid/electrolytes. Thinking that sent me to the ER I was severely dehydrated- it felt like chronic panic attacks throughout the day for days. Heart Palpitations, chest tightness, feeling like there are lumps in my throat, shortness of breath, feeling like passing out, Extreme weakness like in the last few days all ive done was sleep. It went away every time i drank salt free+salt BUT would come back. I couldnt go another day like that and my nurse friend told me to get my electrolytes/thyroid checked out. 2 LITRES OF Lactate Ringers later. Felt like i had a new lease on life. Told my doctor im ready to run a marathon tomorrow and my chest doesnt hurt anymore but my pride and dignity hurt- cuz who TF gets dehydrated in the middle of winter?! 
Bloodwork came back good. He said to get pedialyte and keto is OK!! Im sad I had to kick myself out of ketosis in the last few days but U BEST BELIEVE I SHALL RERTURN. KCKO. Keep Calm and Keto On."
keto,Keto diets have been scientifically proved to be very detrimental to your heart. Thoughts?,"Abstract:
&amp;gt;In addition to their use in relieving the symptoms of various diseases, ketogenic diets (KDs) have also been adopted by healthy individuals to prevent being overweight. Herein, we reported that prolonged KD exposure induced cardiac fibrosis. In rats, KD or frequent deep fasting decreased mitochondrial biogenesis, reduced cell respiration, and increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis. Mechanistically, increased levels of the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB), an HDAC2 inhibitor, promoted histone acetylation of the Sirt7 promoter and activated Sirt7 transcription. This in turn inhibited the transcription of mitochondrial ribosome-encoding genes and mitochondrial biogenesis, leading to cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis. Exogenous β-OHB administration mimicked the effects of a KD in rats. Notably, increased β-OHB levels and SIRT7 expression, decreased mitochondrial biogenesis, and increased cardiac fibrosis were detected in human atrial fibrillation heart tissues. Our results highlighted the unknown detrimental effects of KDs and provided insights into strategies for preventing cardiac fibrosis in patients for whom KDs are medically necessary.

keto,How do you guys stay on this diet? And how much do you spend on food?,"I stayed on keto seriously for a month and lost 13 pounds and I was satisfied. But when the holidays came I kind of lost my motivation. 

And now that when I try to stick to my keto diet I fail. It’s not because of my lack of discipline. It’s because I find myself constantly running out of keto options. Like probably the first 3-4 days I’m good because I have all of my keto foods, but after that, I run out and resort to carb-filled foods such as rice or bread and break the cycle.

Like I don’t know that many keto recipes that are easy to do. I’m not Gordon Ramsay, I can’t cook 5 star meals from scratch. It’s even harder on keto because the majority of foods I like require almond flour, and that piece of shit won’t stick together when I’m trying to mold it into a ball.

So I just stick with eggs and bacon for breakfast, cashews and nuts for snacks, and probably dark chocolate and more nuts just to fill myself up.

That worked for a while, but I would run out of that stuff in a few days, and I would find myself spending like $20 per each grocery run.

How do you guys stick to the diet? And how much do you usually spend on your keto diet?"

Used work out alot until blew my back out, been 6 year recovery and still not 100%. Losing weight has helped my recovery. If you're battling injuries don't give up. Credit my success to strick keto diet, eating during 8 hr window, 2 meals day, and limiting calories. Around 40 lbs down. I laugh when I hear people talk down keto. Yes, I miss pizza, cookies, and ice cream but its totally worth the short term taste sacrifice for longer term health and happiness. Plus I always felt like crap after eating crap.

keto,Chances of a1c going down,"
Hi,

I was diagnosed as prediabetic a year ago with an a1c of 6.0. My father has type 2 diabetes but even then I never took it serious and kept eating what I wanted. These past couple of months I've noticed my blood sugar getting high.

With my fasting typically 80‐100 and 1-2 hours after a meal 130-170. After 3 hours it would usually go down to 110-120. It kinda gave me a scare and in December 18 2020 I decided to start a low carb diet, basically keto. I didn't exercise and only ate less than 30 carbs and less than 1400 calories. Now my fasting is 70-90 and my post meal is usually 90-125 and I've lost 10 pounds so far. I've been doing keto for about 2 months now.

1 week ago I went to the doctor where I had 3 readings of high blood pressure, My doctor and I believe it was from nerves as my heart rate was really fast too. He didn't want to put me on Medicine as I am to young so he sent me to do a blood test. Now tomorrow I will be getting my blood drawn and I'm scared it wasn't enough time for my a1c to go down as it hasn't been 3 months yet and I guess red blood cells take 3 months to renew.

I would like to add on that one time a couple of months ago. I had 2 large pieces of bakery white bread and drank some soda and noticed my blood sugar was 206 10 minutes after drinking it. 2 hours later it was 150. So for people who are diabetic and currently doing keto does that mean that I am already diabetic, it was a one time thing. A couple of weeks after My cousin had a party and I ate a plate of food with a slice of cake and my blood sugar didn't even get that high."

keto,(Relatively) Small Frame Size + Skinny Fat- Dietary Strategy / Next Steps?,"28M, 147lbs, 6'1"", the word ""lanky"" works perfect on me lol

Been keto since last June. Started @ 155lb and now fluctuates bet 144-147lbs. Used to eat high fat keto until I adjusted to high protein (~120g a day) about 2 months ago. Started strength training about the same time(every other day). 

I've always been skinny fat - am an Asian and carby staple foods have been a big part of my life. Until last year I decided that I've had enough and wanted to get rid of my pot belly thru keto (Im now on the right track but I stuck to the therapeutic keto at first - took some time to learn). Before keto I controlled my weight well and I never went above 160.

Since I incorporated resistance training + revamped my diet (~2mth) I think my body fat % had dipped a bit (started at 20 something %? Now it's closer to 17%). I eat 1300-1400 calories per day, a little more when I work out. Doing 16-8 IF too. My target BF% is 13%.

Questions to fellow ketoers:


- what changes should I make to my diet? Shall I keep eating @ my current levels (~20% deficit) or eat more for recomp? (Do I prioritize fat reduction or buildup?) Yes I lift weights but am only slowly ramping up, the amount of work might haven't been there yet.
- is my current regimen sustainable? How long does it usually take to go from 17-18% to 12-13%?
- what level of training should I shoot for? Each sesh I do deadlifts and work on my quad/bi/chest.

Many thanks in advance."
keto,Don't overeat no matter how small the bowl looks.,"Embarrassing story:  I made chili for the first time after being keto for about 6 weeks.

The misery intensified.  Next sensation, I'm going to puke get a bucket!  Two powerful vomits later, wow I feel better but here comes the lower clear out.  I'm such an idiot!  

Chili won't be on the menu for a very very long time.  I think this will teach me an important lesson.   I have to be very careful with portions and think about this with every meal.  My stomach can't handle what it used to handle.  What i still seem to view as reasonable portions, are not reasonable."

keto,Can I have help to figure out my problematic please ? Lactose intolerant who is 5+ years omad and just got an auto-immune Dx.,"It's actually a simple question but I am not English so sorry if this is not a good question.   
After using the calculator, it tell me I need 99g of proteins a day for 141g of fat.   
My problem is that I am trying to solve an auto-immune condition driven from lactose.   
Red meat is my main food. I Just can't eat any plants at all right now and probably for the months to come.  
I clarify my butter, cook my red meat in beef tallow and I am under 20g of carbs a day.  
How can someone like me who can't eat any milk product achieve an OMAD keto with mostly meat ?   


I did search but nothing as far I can see about lactose intolerance, keto and omad meat only ish.   
I have no problems eating a big meal, been doing that for a long time.   


The way I am doing this, since still overweight, is 400/500g of red meat, about 3 to 4 tbl spoons of clarified butter (I think it's about 25% more fat since my 454g butter brick is only about 325g after the process) but I was adding 2 to 4 eggs but it's jumping higher the proteins even more. Also, I recently added 1 avocado to every meals.   


Again sorry of this question is part of other subs but I am really struggling to stay in deep ketosis with that much meat. Would it mean that I need to chug 300g or more butter every days ? There must be something I don't get I am sure or maybe that my intolerance is just making this harder ?   


Thanks to anyone taking the time to help and again sorry if this is not allowed."
keto,Some updated comparison photos on this crazy journey of mine - Maintenance Mode,"Hi all!

I’ve been in maintenance mode since November. Just been practicing a healthy eating style but also not being so strict. So far I’ve had some great success! I’ve stopped weighing myself because I’m now putting on some muscle mass after starting at home toning and work outs in January. So I’m not just going off of how I feel and look (: 


Here are some updated photos!! Hope these motive someone who is struggling (:

keto,Best pork rinds.,"I have always though pork rinds were kind of meh but I recently tried microwavable pork rinds I bought on amazon.  They come in a bag like popcorn you just shake it up and toss in the microwave for 1:30.  They are really good, its like a totally different food.  Highly recommend if you are wanting some ""chips"" type snacks."
keto,NSV - Just trashed my covid wardrobe,"Recently had to buy some extra fat sized jeans and t shirts and was just able to throw them out.  A few weeks ago I was squeezing into them and now they fall off instantly without a belt.  I haven't even lost that much scale weight but I think I've got a whoosh coming.   Thought about keeping the jeans but honestly do not want them around, throwing out my sweatpants too, don't think I'm going to keep anything TOO comfortable around, makes it easy to forget how fat I am. 

PS - Didnt throw in the actual garbage, have them bagged up to give to goodwill, only a few months old."
keto,Best tips for cleansing the digestive system?,"I'd like to go on fasting at least 20 hours per day without vegetables because I get a lot of bloating after eating. My biggest concern is potassium, magnesium and all other nutrients you get from vegetables. I'd like to give my digestive system a long break from food (especially gluten and lactose) and help it heal. What do you suggest? I'm on a Keto diet right now."
keto,NSV Essential Tremor,"I started keto August 28, 2020 at about 190 lb. (F51) reached my goal of 145 on New Year's Day. I've actually gone down to 142 since then but will probably just try to maintain once I hit 140. Honestly I just haven't researched maintenance enough to start so I continued losing. 

Anyhow, I've had an essential tremor since childhood. It's been very embarrassing for me. I avoid dining out with people. I'm always very self conscious about it. The other day I realised it was gone, gone! I've been monitoring it and indeed, it's gone. I googled it and saw a  bit of research pointing to some correlation between keto and essential tremor. I hope it lasts, this can be life changing for me."
keto,Hi everyone! I'm getting my crummy gallbladder removed tomorrow and have been wondering if any members had success with keto after getting their own gb removed? Was it possible for you to go full keto without living in the bathroom? Can you still get down on some tasty avocados?,"I've gained a lot of weight back during quarantine and the holidays and, after a few super non-keto meals, I had a couple VERY uncomfortable days on the couch. The doc told me I had all the symptoms of a diseased gallbladder and that it had to go or I would suffer more couch bound days. So I decided enough was enough and the little guy is getting evicted, first thing tomorrow morning! My main concern is having to essentially eat next to a bathroom if I want to go full on keto again.. any help is appreciated!"
keto,Has anyone done an EXTREMELY simple keto diet?,"I literally want to think as little as possible about my diet once I have it going. If I could, I would drink 2 protein shakes a day, 2 cups of olive oil, and some multivitamins in order to try out Keto for a while. Does anyone have any resources on doing something like this? Thanks in advance."
keto,I’m a road warrior and I’m down 24 lbs in just a month!,"Sup y’all! 

First off, I’ve been a lurker for quite some time but I thought it’s time to introduce myself. My name is Brittany and I live in hotels 49 weeks of the year for my job. I want to thank you all for your success stories and daily motivation. This sub has really kept me going.

Losing weight with my lifestyle really did not seem plausible for quite some time. I gained a lot of weight in the past two years. However, with the help from this sub, I’ve made great progress in my first month. 

Since I Don’t always have a kitchenette in my hotel, I have invested in a George foreman grill and small icebox. I grill up meat and veggies in my hotel room every day and I’ve gotten used to carting around my “diet supplies“ with me. 

I could not be happier with the results! Holy crap, 24 lbs in a month! I feel amazing and my appetite is minimal. Keto has helped me escape my binge eating. I truly can’t believe how easy it has been since I hardly have an appetite. 

I look forward to reading more of your stories and can’t wait to share my future progress!! If anyone reading this is thinking about trying keto... if I can make it work so can you!!!!"
keto,Aldi has a slew of Keto foods on ad this week.,"Aldi in the US rotates a limited-time selection of products every week. This week, I was (kind of) surprised to see they have a number of Keto products available for purchase, for a limited time. The ad is for 2/17-2/23, but my local store already has some of the products available on their shelves.

[Kudos to this thread for posting exactly half an hour before I finished formatting this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/lknnfg/some_fun_keto_finds_at_aldi_this_week/)

You can view the products from the ad [here.] (https://imgur.com/a/tsJ9219), as well as read the full ad [here.]
(https://www.aldi.us/en/weekly-specials/our-weekly-ads/) The rundown is as follows:

***[Savoritz Parmesan Crisps](https://akimages.shoplocal.com/dyn_li/600.0.90.0/Retailers/Aldi/210217HB_021920_S_700052_SAV_ParmesanCrisps_FourCheese.jpg)*** - Basically Whisps, Cheez-its with..just cheese. 2.11oz, 2.89 Each. 100 Calories and Zero Sugars (but probably 1-3G Carbs) per 12 Crisps. Four cheese and Everything available.

***[Mama Cozzis Pizza Kitchen Keto Friendly Roasted Veggie Deli Pizza](https://akimages.shoplocal.com/dyn_li/600.0.90.0/Retailers/Aldi/210217HB_021721_S_704307_704603_MCZ_DeliPizza_Keto_RoastedVeggie.jpg)*** - 14.9oz, Frozen. 6.99 Each. 210 Calories and 4G Sugars per 1/3 Pizza. - Keto Friendly Crust topped with a blend of roasted and grilled veggies, mozzarella and sauce. Not a huge fan of Veggie Pizza, but...it's a pizza.

***[L'Oven Fresh Keto Wraps](https://akimages.shoplocal.com/dyn_li/600.0.90.0/Retailers/Aldi/210217HB_021721_S_704298_LF_KetoWrap.jpg)*** - 8Ct, 8Oz. 3.49 each. 60 Calories and 2G Sugars per wrap.  - High Fiber, Vegan, Zero Cholesterol. Kosher Certified. I'm not sure why you'd do these over the widely available Fit&amp;Active Low Carb Tortillas - My assumption is that they have even less than the 4 carbs that the Fit&amp;Active ones do. These are also clearly a grain/wheat type of wrap, which is different. Personally, the Low Carb Tortillas spike my blood sugar and make me feel like dog-ass, so maybe these will be different. I've been doing Josephs Lavash Bread in place of tortillas/wraps like this personally, and it's been much better for my, but YMMV. 

***[Benton's Keto Cookies](https://akimages.shoplocal.com/dyn_li/600.0.90.0/Retailers/Aldi/210217HB_021721_S_703310_703311_BTN_KetoCookies_DoubleChocolate_cmb.jpg)*** - 4oz, Double Chocolate or Chocolate Chip. 2.99 Each. 130 calories per 4 cookies, 2G Net Carbs. Not sure whether this will be lil bite-sized boys, or four 1oz cookies, similar to Fat Snax. 

***[Sundae Shoppe Keto Ice Cream](https://akimages.shoplocal.com/dyn_li/600.0.90.0/Retailers/Aldi/210217HB_021721_S_700178_SS_KetoIceCreamPints_BrownieBatter_cmb.jpg)*** - 16oz Pint, Butter Pecan, Salted Caramel, Brownie Batter. 3.99 Each. 190-220 Calories and 4-5G Sugars Per Serving, if memory serves there are 2.5 servings per pint. These are going to be added to the already existing lineup of Mint Chocolate Chip, Chocolate Peanut Butter, and Cookie Dough that they sell regularly. Similar to Enlightened and Rebel brand ice cream, they use Monkfruit, Ethruirirititeritittoyitol, and other sugar alcohols, so YMMV for cravings.

I will update this thread with my thoughts on all of them (or as much as I can get my hands on) in the replies, probably by the end of the week."
keto,want to do this right,"Hello! My partner and I have decided that we want to start and figured it best to actually get some help as to getting started. A friend of mine has found huge success with Keto and offered to give us a hand getting started but he's at work, untill then would you be able to share your tips on how to get started? it would be of the utmost help."
keto,Todays is officially my third day in,"
first time doing keto I feel great I'm pretty sure I'm down a pound of two, also used the stick to check and I'm officially in ketosis lol I'm gonna go for as long as I can. I'll be here with this community to share my results week after week. Let's go people go people . I love seeing all the results you guys convince me now it's my turn lol..."
keto,Some fun keto finds at ALDI this week,"Some fun keto stuff at ALDI this week:

Keto Veggie Pizza - the whole pizza is 21 net carbs which officially is 3 servings, but really more like 2. Still, for 10.5 carbs for dinner - that's not bad at all.

Egg wraps - no carbs (if I recall correctly)

Keto cookies - 2 net carbs per serving (4 cookies)

Cheese fries - These were a tasty treat for something crispy. The whole package is 8 ""servings"" which is a little ridiculous, actually. A bit calorie dense, as they are 90 calories per serving and a little surprising, 2 net carbs per ""serving"". But, still, it was a nice treat."
keto,Keto supplements?,"I’ve been having pretty good success on keto and IF; down 44 lbs since Thanksgiving. But I’ve hit a stall. 

Some of the guys that I know have been doing this for a while swear by some of these supplements (from vitaminbounty.com). Before I drop the cash, has anyone used these?"
keto,*TMI* General Q’s about mensural bleeding and constipation,"Hello all. I’ve done keto before in the past for about 40 days and lost a pretty good amount of weight. I switched to CICO due to me having a never ending mensural cycle and extremely bad constipation while I did keto. I know a lot has changed since the last time i’ve done keto and I was just wondering if anyone else struggled with these issues as well and what did you do to fix them? 
Some general background: I did track my macros and I ate around 12 net carbs a day. I also made sure my fat intake was higher than my protein."
keto,For once I feel good while not in ketosis,The brain fog that made me switch to this diet is all gone it seems. Anyone knows what this means or how long it will last? I used to hate being knocked into this state but now it seems fine like I reached some kind of peace with it. Is carb cycling fair game and anyone who’s done it in the past have any advise?
keto,Tiny (but big for me) NSV,"So been Keto since last July (2020) and absolutely love it, I don’t feel restricted, have lost an amazing amount of weight and have regained health.

The past 3 weeks though have been awful, and I have fully slipped up on the past 3 weekends with not sticking to the diet and binge eating, it’s been dreadful. Not excuses, but having COVID, my mum being critically ill with it and starting a new job at the hospital I’ve been under a lot of stress and I guess reverted back to a past coping mechanism.

The NSV though is that before with any other diet or at any other time I would have slipped up, felt crap about myself that I had slipped up and completely given up and reverted back to past eating habits. But not this time! 

Nope, tomorrow is another day and I’m going to come back stronger than ever. I’ve got my eggs, bacon and kale ready for the morning and chicken and broccoli for the afternoon and I’m going to get straight back into it! I’m so proud of myself, I’d never ever in the past been able to just think to myself ‘yeah I’ve slipped up but I can’t change that so focus on moving forward’ and it’s awesome to be able to notice that change in myself! Wish me luck guys, if anybody has any advice on getting back into Keto after a slip up then please let me know, should I expect Keto flu etc?

Stay safe guys!"
keto,Having trouble getting calories and fats.,"I'm supposed to get like 1500-1800 calories and my keto app says 151g of fats a day. I'm barely making it up to 700 calories any day and there's like... no fat. I bought MCT oil too and it's barely putting a dent in my fat intake. and I'm always consuming like 4-5g of carbs. Protein isn't a problem, I bought keto protein powder off Amazon. But I read that too much protein reduces ketones.

I work out like 2-3 hours everyday of that makes any difference. 

I'm also fasting 16:8"
keto,Moving away from Chicken,"So a once mild allergy to chicken has become more with a recent anaphylactic reaction so I am now shifting to avoiding all chicken. 

Nearly all my favorite keto dishes used chicken and I was relying on chicken breast to help me get to my protein each day. I’m not a huge red meat fan, but don’t mind pork at all. What would be a good source of protein similar to a chicken breast?"
keto,What is the most sustainable way to end the keto diet?,"Been on it for about 2 months and lost ca. 10 kg (sorry imperial system) 
I know the weight gain tend to be rapid after ending the diet, at least thats what ive been told. 

But is there a way to lessen the blow so to speak? 

Cheers!"
keto,Combating a short fuse,"So for me, the first 2 weeks of keto always makes me extremely quick to anger. I blow up at the littlest things and really get worked up over trivial matters. Anyone else have this issue?

I am proud of myself this time though. It's my 5th(?) time doing keto, and I have really got a lock on stopping myself before I get too angry, and I definitely have a lock on not blowing up on people close to me. Definitely still having episodes, but I've been able to keep a lid on them unless I'm all alone."
keto,Bullet proof coffee - no butter/ghee,"Heya! I live by bullet proof coffee with mct oil, grass fed butter and cocoa. But I’m about to move abroad to a remote place where I can’t be sure the butter is grass fed. Question - is ordinary non grass fed butter going to do the same or will it be detrimental? I know ghee is an alternative but unsure I will find it there."
keto,Short Term Keto Diet Question,"This probably should have been asked before I started  keto but I am a week into strict keto with a goal to lose around 15 pounds. I was at 181.7 lbs and a week in I am currently at 178 lbs. 

Before I started I only wanted to do keto for around a month and a half maybe two but seeing all this mention of gaining all the weight as soon as you go off it is really discouraging me and given as i’m still 18 I still would like to have the occasional beers on weekends and the carb fast meals that come along with that. Is it really that once you start keto you’re basically committing yourself to that lifestyle or else you’ll just gain weight fast? or can you really go back to a normal functioning body without having to worry too much about carbs once you’re done keto ?"
keto,Cheesecake help,"I did keto about 2 years ago before having a baby and I remember we made a quick keto friendly cheesecake for individual cups. I've tried finding it here and Google but can't find what we did...

Basically it was no Crust and just cream cheese, whipping cream and swerve but I can't remember the ratio for the ingredients.

Any help?"
keto,Sperm and keto?!,"Hello, I started doing keto some weeks ago and came to my mind what does it affect the taste of semen, I asked my gf and she said it has no taste anymore, literally no taste, I was bitter before I start keto. But what about you guys? What does your partners says? Is it better, is it worse?"
keto,Crepini Egg Wraps - I'm a believer,After getting back onto Keto (down 8 lbs in 6 weeks)  I've been missing bread badly.   There's something comforting about a wrap that lettuce couldn't provide.  Today I tried Crepini Egg Wraps  and I'm amazed by how well these egg and cauliflower-powder crepes  held together like a pita and felt chewy like bread in texture.   These will be a new regular as I fight to remove the results of a pandemic sourdough obsession.
keto,Simple little dessert,"2 x teaspoons Chia Seeds - soak for 10-15mins in water.  Drain excess water.  


1 x teaspoon of Desiccated Coconut.  


Mix and eat.  


It's only small, but seems to hit the spot and gets in some fibre too."
keto,Sometimes these food logging apps are annoying... Is there an app out there that I could use to just quickly log the food I'm eating in under a minute?,"Sometimes these food logging apps are annoying... Is there an app out there that I could use to just quickly log the food I'm eating in under a minute?

With MFP and others I feel like I have to open the app and make several clicks just to log what I ate for breakfast.

It may not seem like much but sometimes I’m in a rush and I don’t feel like I have the time to log the food with some of these apps.

Then if I miss logging a meal because I’m in a rush I feel like it makes me less likely to log the next meal….

Idk if im the only one having this problem….

Any suggestions??"
keto,"What is wrong with the so called ""crash diets""?","I think my diet could be considered a crash diet, but please correct me if im wrong. 

So i started keto a month ago. I eat a between 800 to 1000 calories a day. no carbs whatsoever.  
Im 5'10 and weighted 220lbs. I'm currently at 202. I've felt no negative consequences and I dont starve my self. My question is, why are crash diets frowned upon?"
keto,How much protein?,"Just read the FAQ, and ot discusses not necessarily going crazy on dietary fat but to target protein.

Won't high deitary protein just be converted to glucose anyway, kicking you out of ketosis regardless if you are consuming less than 20G of carbs?

Sorry if this is a dumb question. I'm a keto newb."
keto,Keto and tachycardia question,"I’ve noticed since starting keto in January that occasionally my heart rate spikes well over 100. It doesn’t happen all of the time just occasionally. 

I’m guessing from what I’ve read is that I’m dehydrated or possibly lacking sodium. Is this a normal trend on keto?

What do you do to combat this issue?"
keto,How bad is it to spend an entire day without eating?,"So yesterday I got through my first month of keto (I probably go a bit harder than most people recommend, calorie intake wise, but it works for me and I've no issues with hunger or lack of energy). I was watching some sports with my friends and I decided to give myself a break and ate some copious amounts of pizza and even drank some soda.  


Well today other than not feeling great (kind of letargic), I've absolutely had no hunger whatsoever. Other than that I feel fine but im wondering if one day without eating could have some sort of consequences, as I don't think im going to be able to eat today. I've had no symptoms and energy wise im the same as before."
keto,I can’t find anywhere how many net carbs Taco Bell beef has.,"I used to be a fan of just buying sides of taco beef from the Bell, but anecdotally it seems to lower my ketones. Upon further investigation, it looks like their beef includes maltodextrin and corn starch, but it doesn’t say how much. 

I’ve searched everywhere to try and find out exactly how many carbs are in a serving of TB beef, but I haven’t gotten any certain results. Anyone have any idea?"
keto,Absolutely zero sugar?,"Has anyone ever successfully lost weight with a little sugar in your keto diet? I’ve done this diet before, and I’m 7 months postpartum so I’m ready to shed the baby weight. But my dilemma is finding a decent sweetener for my morning coffee; I tried all kinds my first go around with keto, including Swerve but that particular one always upsets my stomach. I’m just wondering if two teaspoons of regular sugar will sabotage my weight loss."
keto,Are carbs absorbed into meat through marinades?,"Hi Folks! First off Amazing information and people on this sub, I lurk and learn all kinds of things. One thing I was curious about was if carbs transfer through marinades. I realize it may be an insignificant amount but I am genuinely curious. I was thinking one could weigh weights of marinade before and after and calculate but not sure. Either way not going to stop the one I’ve been using cause I love it and have room to spare in macro even if there are some sneaky ones in there. 

But Any insight would be appreciated! Thank you!"
keto,Need advice: Read to join (again) yet know its not a lifelong lifestyle for me...?,"Thanks for listening and being support for so many of us over the years. I'll try to keep it simple:

\-Overweight most of my adult life, grew up as the ""big kid"" for sure

\-Lost 40-80 pounds in the past a few times with crazy, self-hatey CICO and stringent KETO.

\-Realized I have other emotional problems that added to my weight and have a very expensive coach to help me deal with these underlying and very important issues that I use food to soothe/numb/etc.

\-Also realized that I go into binge/restrict mode or black/white mode with ANY/ALL ""diets"" (diet here meaning literally any specific way of eating). So therefore, Im mentally/emotionally nervous to start keto even though I know it ""works"" and also makes me feel great. In the past, its lasted anywhere between 6-8 weeks before I just felt tired of the food, left out of ""regular"" life, got too nervous that I couldn't eat like that forever, felt unbalanced without fruit/veg (like my body wanted more fruit), etc.

\-Not making the above ""excuses"" but rather real life experience of being on Keto, the good and the bad. My main question is: Do you think bouts of 6-8 weeks of Keto every now and then to get rid of sugar and drop some weight is healthy? Im 39 and simply just do NOT see myself on one diet/lifestyle/whateveryouwannacallit for the rest of my life. Its not in my personality or style to commit to one thing forever, I've given that 39 years of trials and it leads to self-hate, guilt, shame, punishment, etc. However, without any plan its the usual: too much sugar, alcohol, bread, sweets, ""eat whatever you want"" lifestyle that also is leading to pain in my joints, brain fog and some depression.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help/advice is welcome!"
keto,Is Irish butter good for Keto?,"Hello, 

I really love Irish butter than other butter. Recently, I bought Irish butter from ALDI, which is Countryside Creamery, Spreadable Irish Butter with CANOLA OIL. I wonder if this Irish butter will kill my keto？ Can I use it for my coffee?

Thanks"
keto,Anyone wanna be keto buddies with me?,"I've recently gained back most if not all of the weight I lost on keto - I have no idea how, but I'm determined to get it back down again! Would love it if I could have keto buddies to do this with - literally no one I know knows about keto, let alone be on it.

Please message me if you're down! Would love to have someone to do this with :-)"
keto,50 pounds today!,"I started this diet 10 days after knee surgery on November 10th. My only change was my diet, as I couldn't exercise other than walking. Well today I hit my second goal of 50lbs !!! Imagine if I were exercising?"
keto,"Wow, I thought people were exaggerating, but I legit feel no hunger at all.","Started keto about \~2 weeks ago. I kept hearing that you'll rarely feel hungry on keto, even though you will be losing weight, but I always thought people are just hyping it up and exaggerating. 

I'm obese, and been obese my whole life (I'm 22). ""Normal"" for me was to feel hungry every 2 hours... no matter how much I ate. 

Now I can go 20-24 hours without food and see no big deal in it, the hunger is just not there. I might have a black coffee in the morning and then not think about food until dinner. This is amazing. I honestly can't believe dieticians are not yet recommending this diet for treating obesity...."
keto,Beef Bacon,"Hello all, 

Assuming it wasn’t cured with sugar, I ordered beef bacon from a local butcher, and unfortunately, there isn’t any nutritional information. However, while I was eating it, it did taste a tiny bit sweet. I didn’t find out that it had sugar till I ate it and called them up, and confirmed it was cured with salt, sugar, and water. I had around 100g. Based on your experiences, would this be enough to kick me out of ketosis? Thank you!"
keto,I need motivation,"Started the day before New Years.  I had great success all through January. I’m down about 19lbs. I have about 100 to go. 
I’ve stalled for about 2 weeks. I know there’s probably good internal changes still happening, but the lack of scale movement makes it harder for me to stay strong with all the tasty things that surround this holiday."

keto,What happens if we consume 40-50g of carbs?,"I understand the optimal range is 20-30g to get into ketosis but what if someone does the lowest of low carb and keeps it to 40-50g, if ketosis means using up of pre existing fat storage as opposed to incoming carb then how much of a difference is 30 and 50 g of carbs? Would it stop using pre existing fat storage ? What does it use then just the incoming additional 20g carbs makes all the difference ???

I am a noob and if there is an article or a video that explains this well pls point that out for me, that would be good too.

I have been trying to find this out without much luck as to wat happens in that 10 to 20g addition in a still very much keto diet.

keto,Am I doing it right?,"So I started feb 1st. It’s been about 2 weeks. I do not weigh myself but I’ll tell y’all straight up, ima fatass. 5’6 260ibs ish. This is what I eat. I want to know if it’s resonance for keto

Breakfast (sometimes I skip)
2-3 scrambled, or over easy eggs
4 sausage breakfast links
1/2 avocado

Lunch 

10-12oz water before my meals and 10-12oz after

1 avocado (sometimes 1/2)
8-9oz of Ny strip steak medium rare only salt
(also 2 scrambled eggs with my steak).

6-7oz of pork chops if I don’t feel like steak that day
(I usually boil my pork chops with greens called yu choy and then it becomes more of a soup, it’s a traditional dish in my culture and yes I drink the broth).

2-3 baked chicken thighs with skin if I don’t feel like pork or steak
(When I eat this I usually have it with steamed green beans on the side and a few raw Thai chili peppers).

6-7oz of salmon with skin if I don’t feel like the above
8 shrimp cooked with tomatoes, shallots, and garlic.
Usually 1 avocado with

Dinner (I skip 5 days a week... I work nights and I don’t eat at night)

1-2cups plain black coffee (at work)

My days off my dinner will be usually any of the three I had above during lunch. If I ate in during lunch chances are dinner will be the others. 

I sometimes substitute avocado for steamed eggplants. Honestly I think I eat more eggplant.

So all in all I do feel that my clothes fit a bit better now. My breath smells awful and I have to brush 3 times a day to deal with the smell... my pee smells even worst than my breath.... I’m not staying asleep too good. I stopped snoring..... I do feel less hungry but sometimes when I fast from lunch until breakfast the next day I get hungry but it’s easier to fast now compared to when carbs were still in my life. Overall I don’t feel like I  lost much weight as I wanted to and I’m at the point where I don’t think I’ll have an issue not eating anything high in carbs.... just want to know if I’m in ketosis? How long until I can see a drastic change of fat loss? Thanks for taking your time and reading/commenting."
keto,Extravagant food = usually keto!,"Expanding the fondue post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/ljeay7/fondue\_nights/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/ljeay7/fondue_nights/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

I have found repeatedly that celebration food, aside from desserts, are rich and extravagant and often fully keto.

Can you add to the list?

* Asparagus
* Alfredo sauce
* Béarnaise sauce
* Cheeses-of-all-kinds 
* Caviar
* Eggs Benedict 
* Foie gras
* Hollandaise
* Lobster/ Lobster Thermidor
* Salmon
* Standing rib roast
* Truffles (1 piece is 3 carbs, but also 3 fibers) 
* Wagyu

I am baffled by people who feel like keto is restrictive -- we get to eat all the great stuff!!   
Further, for those who claim that keto is expensive -- the list looks pricey-- those sauces which make a piece of meat luxurious are generally very simple and truly inexpensive."

keto,Will small amounts of simple sugars kick me out of ketosis?,"I’ve been eating fairly strict and clean keto for about two months now and I’ve got to admit... I’ve got a bit of an addiction. A starburst addiction. Most nights I treat myself to two starbursts which is ~8g of sugar. I’m currently cutting eating 1900 cal a day and MAYBE 20g total net carbs including the starburst. This don’t enough to kick me out of ketosis right? Speaking strictly in terms of staying in ketosis, does it matter what kind of carbs I have exactly? 

I know you shouldn’t eat candy but I figure if that little treat can help me eat super clean the rest of the day it’s better than a super strict diet I can’t stick to."
keto,Low grade - extreme Nausea,"Hello there, I’m looking for some advice. I’m two and a half weeks into shifting my eating to keto and I’ve been experiencing persistent nausea. I was feeling fantastic a week and a half in but just this last week the queasiness hit and hit hard. It’s better during the day and so I find I’m able to eat but then in the evenings it gets worse and I sometimes am woken up by it at 2am. I should also mention I’m eating on a 18:6 IF schedule. 

I’ve been supplementing electrolytes and salts (sodium and potassium) and I take a magnesium supplement already. I also drink a ton of water. I am also on a mood stabilizer (Lithium) which I have a hunch may have something to do with this. Anyone else had this experience?

I’ve tried bone broth but it makes me even more queasy. 

I fairly certain I’m eating enough fat and I’ve even been eating a bit extra since I’m not really trying to lose weight but rather benefit mentally from keto. 

I was wondering if anyone has any tips or idea of why this might be happening? From numerous google searches it seems to be keto flu still. I’d appreciate your thoughts. Thank you!"

keto,Gall stones and keto [Medical],"I've been on and off keto since the 90's and have had success losing weight and relieving inflammation. However, an emergency appendectomy a couple years ago revealed that my gallbladder is loaded heavily with gallstones, and removal of the organ was recommended. I still have it, though ... and the information out there regarding existing severe gallstones and keto is very confusing and contradictory. I'm really cautious of echo chamber medical opinion -- ie. people with a thing to prove will only try to prove that thing by referencing those who agree with them. Some keto medical sites say there's no risk, some say there is some risk, some non-keto sites say keto causes gallstones and attacks... What I do know is, I had a couple of minor attacks during a solid year of carb-gorging and they got much worse when I included wheat in my diet. No problems this time round on keto so far, but it'd be good to get hold of some reliable information that isn't skewed to one side or the other."
keto,Upping carbs,I’ve been successful with keto over the last 4 months. Down 46lbs as of this morning with about 35 left to go. I’ve been doing 20 max carbs per day but have recently been wondering how much going up to 30 would effect my weight loss? There is so much more you can do with just those 10 extra carbs. Is 20 a hard upper limit or is there anybody here who eats more and doesn’t have any issues?
keto,The Last Supper,"Hey I need advice guys,

Been on keto for a month yesterday (Down 16lbs) going great, I'm getting braces put on in two days and before I do I really wanted to have popcorn for the last time for a few years, because its my favorite food. So pretty much I wanna splurge a bit and eat a bunch of popcorn for a night then go back to keto the next day, will this really mess up my progress or should it be fine?"
keto,I don’t think I have ever been so heathy.,"I can’t order any food online. The only alcohol I drink is low cal IPA’s/white claws which get me hammered after only a few. I cook whole food day in and day out with the most “processed” food I am eating is protein powder/cheese. I am in the 180’s with being 5’11 bio female. 

I used to order out 2-4 times a week. Eat a medium pizza a weekend with a 6 pack plus of beer. Most foods were bread based. I was in the 200~. 

Started Jan 1st and can’t go back. I need to be slim to reduce risk during major surgery. I am always full, eat when I am hungry and my skin is glowing. 

Damn you all! Joking, I love you all for being on this journey with me. -Kai"
keto,Seeking advice for transitioning off of 2+ year keto,"I have been on keto for about 2.33 years now, save a few cheat weeks here and there for special occasions, but I think I should consider making some changes.  

I initially did really good and 200 pounds overall, the vast majority of it within the first year and a half in combination with intermittent fasting and physical activity, my waistline has shrunk as I put on muscle mass.  But in the last 6ish months, my weight has hovered around 255-260, and I worry that long term keto may be causing complications, I stuck on this long to try and lose these last 60 pounds.  

But my biggest reason for transitioning off of keto has to do with potential side-effects mentally and physically:  constipation, back pain, depression, memory issues and headfog, and motivation, and maybe gut health?

My willpower has plummeted, and now I either struggle to bring myself to eat, or I just reach for things that are easy to eat, like processed meat, cheese, peanuts and peanut butter, especially after workshifts, I haven't been able to stick with intermittent fasting and lately when I have attempted to, my mood fluctuates too much.

I used to exercise 4 to 6 days a week over a year ago, but for a while now I struggle to motivate myself work out more than once or maybe twice a week.  I have had some persistent lower back pain for about 6 months now too, and I worry that keto may either be causing or exasperating this issue.  Most of all I am concerned that long term keto is resulting in depression as I am now.

Transitioning off of the diet will be a big change for me, I will more or less avoid sugar where I can, still going to eat leafy greens, I mostly need to incorporate more fiber.  I was wondering if anyone had some experience and/or advice on transitioning off of keto after being on it for a long period, I feel like I don't know what I should be incorporating into my diet specifically aside from a light amount of whole grain pasta and bread, and maybe fruit.  

tl;dr is mostly that I have been on long term keto, and would welcome advice on what I should do to transition off of keto.  I feel like I have been on it for so long that I have to re-learn what a normal diet should be for me.  I will also be happy to answer any questions :)"
keto,Fondue Nights,"Hey everyone, I had an epiphany that I should have thought of 18 months ago, fondue is a perfect Keto meal. 

So for Valentine’s Day I have planned an oil fondue with beef, chicken and shrimp, and a cheese fondue with mushrooms, asparagus, broccoli and cauliflower. 

I think it will be a fun and special thing my non Keto hubby and I can do together. 

Thought I’d share in case others struggle for ways to celebrate birthdays or anniversaries or other special occasions."
keto,Just not hungry,"Hi. I have been doing keto since Jan 2, and I have been losing some weight.  (5'2"", 52 yo, 225 lb.) I have been using a carb manager app to record my food and micro nutrients.  I am worried, though, because I am also intermittent fasting, but not on purpose.  I am just NOT hungry! I have been keeping my micro nutrients on track (I think) by eating 70-75% fat, 15-20% protein, and 5-10% carbs.  The problem is that my  calories are about 1,000 a day. On days I go to the gym my intake will adjust to 600-800 cals/day.  I have no desire to eat until mid-afternoon, I'll eat two small meals a few hours apart, and I am done for the day. I drink lots of water and green or herbal tea.
Am I wreaking havoc by not eating enough grams of protein and fat? Any insight will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
keto,EU and Measuring Potassium Intake?,"I'm struggling to measure my potassium intake to know if I'm getting enough because it's often not listed on the food labels here (some products choose to show it, but it doesn't appear to be part of the general EU labeling, unless this is just an issue in the country I live in). While I can guess at potassium levels for things like ""chicken breast"", it's harder to guess for something like bacon. Not all bacons are made the same, after all. Same issue for magnesium, but I'm less concerned about it.

Any other folks in the EU encountered and overcome this? Tips/suggestions? Just use whatever has labels and do a best guess on the rest?"
keto,Please help me. I gained back weight and I haven’t even been losing much and now I’m just super discouraged.,"I’ve been doing keto for at least a month. I’ve lost roughly 10 pounds in a month but the last time I did keto I was losing weight like crazy. I’m making every effort to keep it clean keto as possible and last time it was super dirty keto. I just don’t understand what’s going on. The only difference I can think of is that last year while doing keto I drank a ton of green tea cause I worked at DD and I could get it free. 
I’m also working out this time and last time I wasn’t. I’m just hella confused, and incredibly discouraged.

keto,Little help with sweetner please!,"Hello all, only been doing keto for 2 weeks and its been going good, but I've hit my first snag,  I've been planning on making keto desserts for when my sweet tooth hits and everyone reccomended i use swerve granulated sweetner, well now ive picked up 2 bags and realize it says 4grams of carbs on the back, I've been looking it up for 30 minutes now if its still safe to use bunt cant find anything! Does anyone here use swerve as thier sweetner and can confirm i wont get knocked out of ketosis?"
keto,Could I eat the same meals everyday?,"Hi, 22f - I am waiting for some test results before I fully turn to keto, but I have pcos and need to loose 20-25kgs (about 50lbs, I’m 5’11 and weigh around 115kg) to get my health in order. I’m currently in Lockdown and am unable to go to the gym! 

I’m not a big fan of eating, so I practically have no metabolism, but I’m prepared to eat at least twice a day. Probably at 13:00 and 17:00. My main question is can I eat the same things everyday? Like eggs cooked in coconut oil for my first meal and then a large dinner that gives me all my calories?? Thanks!"
keto,Cystic acne on keto,"I have PCOS and with it comes cystic acne. I’ve been doing keto for 5 weeks now. Normally I’d get one cystic pimple on my chin maybe once every other month, a pimple or two on my period. Since I’ve started keto, I have 3 cystic pimples on my chin and more pimples on my cheeks. Normally the cysts don’t hurt a lot and rarely get red. The last one of the three (currently raging) is very painful and red. It’s size is almost 1/3 of my chin. I’m wondering if Keto has to do with this? Anyone had a similar experience? 


Some information:

- I do clean keto with unprocessed/unpackaged foods (except for protein powder, pickles and yogurt) 

- I’m not dairy intolerant although I’m consuming a bit more than my usual diet. 

- I’m eating 80% chocolate?? but I used to eat a lot of shit without problems before. 

- I’m using chocolate protein isolate sweetened with suclarose. Not consuming artificial sweetners except for the protein powder and the very occasional stevia. 

- I’m eating more nuts and seeds than my usual diet. 


Ps. Sadly, the “elimination diet” won’t work for me because I’m TERRIBLE at noticing changes in my body."
keto,Keto Period cramps is a nightmare,"So this is my first week on Keto and everything is great- way more energy, occasional headaches gone, etc. Enter my first period. Holy smokes, it was hell. It came on so quickly like a massive punch right in my lower belly. I couldn’t function at all. I threw up in the bathroom and fell asleep on the bathroom floor since I couldn’t decide if I was going to throw up more. The pain kept on, which feels like a constant scraping in my tummy. It lasted about 2 hours and by the time the pain subsided, I was drenched in sweat and I felt sooo fatigued. 

This is kind of a dealbreaker for me since I absolutely loathe period cramps more than anything in my life. If I were to continue on this journey with the promise of a normal period cycle, what steps should I take to alleviate this kind of pain?"
keto,Possible screw up. Green beans are a carb.,"So I started keto a week ago. I’m 450 lbs and have severe chronic back pain. I have a 2 month old daughter and it’s time to make some changes. So I started keto. I basically just eat omelettes and drink water. However my fiancée and I ordered Salem food from K&amp;W and I got chop steak, broccoli, and green beans. I made the assumption that green beans were keto. While eating them I made the connection of the beans in the pod and actual beans being carbs. So my question is, how bad did I mess up eating a serving of green beans. Will I be back to square one trying to get into ketosis?"
keto,Electrolyte bomb,"I figured it's a good idea to share this since most of you are based in the US:  
have you ever heard of a cucumber soup?  
  
It's basically a mix of bone broth and pickle juice (plus the cucumbers, grated or blended). It just now occured to me that it's a great and tasty way of replenishing your electrolytes.
  
Now, I'm not sure about the pickles you guys have in your stores, where I live, we've got two types - dill pickles (the sweet and sour ones) and the salted cucumbers (made the same way as sourkraut). For the soup, you use the latter.  
  
Traditionally, the soup is also made with diced potatoes and veggies (carrot, parsley root and celery root) but those are not necessary, I figured. All you need to do is to add the pickles/cucumbers to your broth and cook until soft. Add a splash of heavy cream before serving, and that's it.  
  
Hope that's gonna prove useful for some of you.

keto,Is this fat adaptation? 🤔,"34F, Started at 239 Jan 6th, down to 216-218ish. The weight fell off until about a week ago and now it's just going up and down between 216-220. Is this fat adaptation? Am I just waiting for the ""whoosh"" ? 
I've read the faq, just hoping for you real live humans to reassure me not to be discouraged. I haven't cheated once!! 🤗

I am attaching an imgur link with some screenshots from my tracking app. Never done that before so hopefully it works.  I've been below 20g net carbs and calorie intake is not really changed. I'm working on lowering from 1600 to 1500 since my calorie needs have probably decreased a little.

keto,My Thoughts After Two Months of Keto,"The first week I started this diet I was most definitely struggling. However I stuck with it and didn't bother setting long term goals. For context I am a 19 yr old 5'11 Male and my sw was 260 lbs. I am at 222 lbs now and seriously am loving the ketogenic lifestyle. Things quickly clicked after I got past the second week and I knew this was the change my body needed! At times it doesn't even feel like a diet which is such a rewarding feeling. Matched with the gym, it has been a great change for not only my appearance but also my mental well-being. I won't lie and say it has been smooth the entire way through. I've hit some roadblocks and have been learning as I go. Mainly fighting sugar cravings and watching serving sizes. Overall I don't see how I could stop this lifestyle now. I hope everyone stays strong and keeps at it! It's so worth it! If you have any advice or experience that you think I should know please comment! I'm so new at this and am trying to learn and get better at the diet! Even though this is my first post, everyone's posts on r/keto has helped me whether it was motivation or a question! I didn't want to post as I was so worried I would fall off the track but I'm finally sticking with it! If there is any advice I could give it would be to stay consistent and embrace the small victories. Once you have a bunch of small victories piled up it then feels like a big accomplishment when you really think about it :)"

Did Noom for a year and it helped me mentally. Started Keto January 11th and am down 11lbs since then - 25lbs down since last April. 

For the better part of two decades now I have had to shop ""plus size"" clothing. 

I'm now starting to have real hope and see a future where I can buy a size 14 or even a 12 someday instead of a 22. That I won't have to wonder if a 2X will fit or if I have to try the 3X. I haven't felt that glimmer like it's a real possibility...since I stopped being that size.

keto,Keto will forever be my new lifestyle.,"I have struggled with weight gain most of my life. My weight fluctuated alot when I was a kid, teenager, and a young adult. I always kept somewhat in shape by playing soccer. And my eating habits have always been inconsistent. Grew up in a hispanic household, as you know mexican food has tons of fat and CARBS, always on the menu. Everytime I quit playing soccer I would balloon up immediately. I even when going to the gym and working out excessively I could not lose weight. In the recent years work became hectic and I havent been able to play again. I got my all time high record of 250 lbs (5'11,M).  My confidence was at an all time low, even though a I have a girlfriend that loves me very much. Anyway I finally had enough and after tons of research I starte the Keto. In the beggining I was a bit skeptical, I kept thinking to myself "" how is all this fat good for me?"" But I muscled through. I have lost 40 lbs in 6 months. I have never felt better in my life, my mood, my phisical strenght, my mentallity and  my overall health many have improved dramarically. This is life changing. My goal is 190. I am at 210. I will live my life with keto forever. I recommend it to anyone who is skeptical. Good luck to everyone out there."
keto,Carb dreams,"I'm on day 12 of a keto diet and last night I had my first dream about devouring carbs. The whole time I was thinking about how it would take me out of ketosis, but I didn't care because it was worth it and I'd just get back into ketosis within a couple of days of eating low carb.

I've read that dreams like this are a common phenomenon for keto people. Has this happened to other people much? Do they mess with your willpower at all? I'm not finding it to be a problem right now, but I worry, lol."
keto,I’m scared that years of bad eating has ruined my body,"26F/5’5/180 lbs: New to Keto- the keto calculator suggests that I should target ~1300 calories to lose weight.   

The problem is, for the last 6 years I have been low-key starving myself- not for weight loss, but simply because I was a lazy/picky eater. My daily intake would be less than 1000 calories and I feel that my body got used to it, if that makes sense.   

I lead a sedentary lifestyle but I’m trying to divorce my work desk and move around more. My worry is that I will put on weight given the years of subpar eating and keto won’t work out for me. I can’t find anything relevant online about people who go back to a healthy number of calories after starving themselves- what happens to them?   

I do realize that I need to change my eating lifestyle, because I definitely cannot sustain my current diet- I’m just wondering if I should expect weight gain and I’m hoping someone can point me in the right direction."
keto,Ways to kickstart progress from Keto limbo?,"Last year my mum shocked our whole family by losing 20 kilos on keto and looking healthier than she has on any meal-plan or fat-loss fad. 

Since then she has been a great advocate for the diet and has imparted much wisdom in the worlds of both fasting and low carbs. Though she still maintains a ketogenic state today, she admits she stills wants to lose another 6-8 kilos of fat, but is frustrated by the scale not moving.

In comparison to the first ‘20 kilos’, in which she was constantly learning new recipes and researching ketos effect on the body, she’s found herself in a keto limbo, where even with OMADs and exercise the weight won’t shift off.

I thought I’d open the mic to this community to see if anyone had similar experiences or advice that could make the difference in kickstarting her progress. Thanks a lot."
keto,How long to see results?,"How long does it take in keto to start loosing some kind of weight?  I don’t expect miracles, but I’ve been in ketosis a week and the scale as not budged on tiny point. Nada.  I see so many people talk about 10 lbs over a month, so I guess I’m feeling a little discouraged.I was hoping to at least have lost 1 lbs."
keto,Can having carbs first thing effect keto?,"This might sound like a daft question, however, I’m currently limited to 5% carbs a day (which roughly works out around 12-15g) 

I usually spend around half of these carbs by having a coffee with sweetener and creamer. If I have this first thing in the morning, without consuming any fat or protein for a couple of hours afterwards, will this effect ketosis? 

Should I be eating enough protein/fat to balance out the carbs before drinking this coffee?"
keto,297 to 217,"I'm 51, the last time I was this weight I was just out of high school, and then once again around age 22 when I was running fairly long distances.  After I wore my ankles and knees through and had a few other injuries, I was out.  Still liked to eat though, and the men in my family are big.  Years go by, I developed a taste for alcohol in various forms, and eventually piled on enough to hit 297.

My diet was amazing for two years before I could let go of the booze.  Eventually gave it up and foom that weight came off like it was on fire.  Immediately just dropped 40 pounds in the first month and it's not coming back.  I had saggy skin issues there for a minute.  Ramped up the fat in my diet to try to keep the skin supple and shrinking, and it's mostly working.  I'm definitely not going to need skin surgery, but it might be another couple years until it all tightens up.

I've added fasting to my regimen and that's helped me figure out that cheese has to go, and eating at Panda Express is just not something I should be doing, and certainly not four times a week like i do now. I did my second four day fast recently and feel good.  My appearance has changed for the better too, it's very encouraging.  I feel like doing a one week fast every month, I can adjust my work schedule around it.

I have a bunch of Alfredo sauce and some other cheese to either decide to pay the price or just let it go.  So far this all agrees with me very well.  I eat a pound of high quality liver sausage once a month now but I might make that once a week.  I have very high quality and locally sourced meat in my freezer and mostly organic vegetables, mostly frozen, because I let so much fresh stuff spoil that I'd rather just make frozen at this point.  Surprisingly, my food budget is way down!  Quality over quantity, and quality over artificial variety."
keto,Cannot lose a single gram,"I did keto combined with 16:8 IF and calorie counting pre-pregnancy and it worked wonders, I lost around 25kg back then. I then got pregnant and got almost everything back. I now started doing keto again (baby is 6 months old, I am not breast feeding). Just like before I am combining keto with 16:8 IF and I track calories (currently 1500 net, LoseIt said I should have 1800 but I lowered the amount after not losing any weight). I cannot do any sports as everything is closed but I do walk a lot. My macros are perfect (I track that too). And yet for the longest time, about a month now, I am not losing any weight. And I cannot understand why. Anyone else gone through this?"
keto,I’m constantly hungry,"I’m really confused. When I first started out on Keto, I was satisfied on 1-2 meals a day with a couple snacks, and most of the time I wasn’t feeling hungry but my blood sugar was low. Now, for the past few days, I have to keep stopping myself from eating a ton; and night snacking has been a bad habit recently.

Sometimes when I get really invested in an activity, I unintentionally neglect my body’s needs (ie. food, water, sleep), so maybe this is just me having difficulty with binging for not being consistent in my diet. I’m still losing fat, I think, and I’m still eating low carb. I’m just not sure what the problem is precisely. 

I’ve had days recently where I don’t eat at all, and I’m completely fine the next day, so I’m not sure. My body’s just weird af. Any help with this conundrum would be deeply appreciated."
keto,Need help. Digestion issues,"Quick backstory- 2017 to mid 2018 did strict keto plus exercise for about 18months and lost 120lbs. No issues, felt amazing, loved it.

No pain or anything its just uncomfortable. I figured it would go away after a week or so. Well its been 3-4 weeks now and its still happening. Ive been doing alternate day fasting past 2 weeks and even on my days I dont eat it happens. Been thinking about trying ox bile or something, maybe my stomach needs help digesting? Has anyone else had these issues? Any advice? 

Im 6'2"" 250lbs male. Been eating between 1700-2000 cals a day. Lift 3-4 times a week and cardio on the other days. Mainly eating eggs, bacon, cheese, beef, kale, asparagus, chicken and broccoli."

keto,Tomato Alternative?,"I love tomatoes so so much. However I’m trying to cut them from my salads as it’s really cutting into my carb count.

Any ideas or recommendations on lower carb count veggies or dressings that may spice up my boring green salad? TIA!"
keto,"Has anyone else noticed a rash of fake ""keto"" products lately?","I don't post here much but I felt like this was important.

My Dad shops at Costco a lot and the other day I was at his place, he showed me some new ""keto friendly"" foods he got at Costco. While this was very thoughtful of him, I was looking at the label, and these foods weren't really as low carb as they would lead you to believe. Only if you restricted yourself to a small portion would it really fit into a ""keto"" framework, and even then not very well. The point of keto is, as I understand it, not to restrict the portions of food, but to restrict the contents to high fat and protein, so I find it disingenuous that this product would be labelled keto.

Mainly just wanted to post a warning about this type of thing and see if anyone else has noticed the same stuff. I'm increasingly weary of anything marketed as ""keto"" as there really isn't any regulation on how that word can be used"

keto,Wrong foods? Weight loss stall/ frustration,"Wrong foods? Weight loss stall frustration

(5’5”, 24, F, SW 314, CW 227) I have been on and off keto for over a year, and have had ups and downs the whole time. I lost the majority of my weight during the first couple months of being on keto, and it has been a slow process for the past 8 months or so. I have pretty much been around the 230’s since August of 2020. 

I have found that despite eating keto and tracking my food, calories and carbs (under 20/25 g) I have been unable to lose weight. I just switched from a goal of 1,600 calories to 1,300 due to trying to be in a larger deficit. My goal macros are 20/25 g carbs, 85 G protein, 106 g fat. (I do not cheat with non keto foods, the max I go is 30 net carbs) 

I also test my ketones and it used to show VERY clearly I was in ketosis, now it shows up as either nothing or barely in ketosis. 

The only thing I have found to help is being in a very big calorie deficit (about 1,000) a day, or doing alternate day fasting, which is not sustainable. 

I’m wondering if there were any foods you guys find that will throw you out of ketosis, despite being low carb. Or if there is any advice on getting over weight loss stalls and the frustration that comes with it."
keto,"Happy to report I have maintained my weight, muscles, and gym strength on Keto","I began a strict Keto diet about 1 month ago for health reasons (asthma), NOT to lose weight.  I was super hesitant to start the diet because I did not want to lose body mass and strength in the gym.  I mentally prepared myself to inadvertently lose over 10 lbs...  Yet I wondered... how are carnivorous animals, like tigers, able to get so big and bulky with zero carbs?  The simple answer... LOTS of meat &amp; fat... they can eat 10+ lbs of meat in one sitting.  

I am happy to report, after a month of eating nothing but fatty meats (up to 3 lbs per day), butter/coconut oil, vegetables, and 1 handful of berries per day (~3,000 calories per day? Not counting)... I have maintained 187 lbs at 5'9"", excellent workouts/strength at the gym, and not lost much muscle, if any.  And I am also happy to report reduced asthma symptoms (not cured), clear sinuses, minimal allergies, and reduced anxiety/depression.  It took me less than 1 week to adapt to the diet from Paleo, and I sure hope these benefits last..."

I tried googling for better digestible sources of fat but all I find are articles saying that fat is generally a problem for digestion and should be avoided...not really an option on keto. So I thought the people here might know some things I could try.

keto,Chai seeds,What's everyone's thoughts on chia seeds?  I just had a  friend introduce them to me as a way to feel fuller when intermittently fasting.  Apparently they absorb a lot of water and keep your belly feeling full.  I mixed 1tbspoon chai seed with 1/4 cup coconut milk and let set in the fridge over night.  Topped with a few berries.  Eating it right at the end of my food window.  It's delicious! Anyone else use chia seeds?  The coco milk was only 3g carbs for 1 cup and from what I can tell the seeds are negligible due to extremity high fiber count.  Hoping this group can give me some confirmation on that!
keto,Adjusting Recipe Macros in Carb Manager,"I have a very silly, very granular question, but I think once I sort it out I might be okay going forward if I try to do something like this again! 

I downloaded the Carb Manager app to calculate and track my meals and macros. It seems fine as far as food management goes! Visually pretty easy to navigate. In it, I found a recipe for soup that looked really good, and something that would be great to make for lunch. The recipe contained a tablespoon of cornstarch as a thickening agent, but also said you could substitute xantham gum for fewer carbs.

My question is this: how do I calculate the adjustment in carbs if I use xantham gum instead of cornstarch? The app says that a tablespoon of cornstarch has 7g of carbs, so would I subtract 7 from the total of the pot, and instead add however many carbs xantham gum has? 

OR! 

Since it’s only one tablespoon for a whole pot of soup and I might get, say, 5 bowls out of a whole pot, is the amount of carbs from the cornstarch ultimately negligible, since it would be just two or so grams of carbs per bowl? In which case, I guess I would subtract just one carb from my total when I log the soup into my day?

I know my question is very specific to this one app, but I imagine making substitutions for things isn’t uncommon, such as removing an ingredient you don’t care for but is tracked in a recipe. Thanks for your help!"

Thursday night is meal prep night for Friday through Sunday! Tonight I'm whipping up some chicken soup, which is pretty simple: broth, chicken, spices, onion and garlic, spinach, mushroooms (whatever I feel like) IN A MASSIVE VAT. I eat it with a ridiculous amount of mozzarella cheese in it. One bowl is super filling. That's this weekend. What about you?"

keto,Forever at a plateau,"I've been on a diet for more than two months. The first month I just restricted calories (1200ish cal) and I lost 5 pounds in a month. After that, I just....stopped losing weight. So I started keto and I started exercising about 4-5 times a week for a minimum of 20 minutes. I wish I could exercise more, but I'm only able to when my son is napping. Anyways, I upped my calories to 1400 to 1500 because I thought maybe I'm not losing weight because I'm not eating enough. I lose about 100 to 200 cal in a workout. My macros are 75% fat, 25% protein, and 5% carbs and I follow that pretty well. I was able lose two more pounds and again....I stopped losing weight. So after about a month on keto I added intermittent fasting and I've been doing that for about 2 weeks now. And nothing....

My husband says that he sees that I've lost weight and I can see it too. Although, it feels like I should have at least dropped some more pounds with the way I've been working at it. 

I'm a female weighing 178lbs and height is 5'4. Work out 4-5 times a week cycling and weights. Keto plus intermittent fasting (18:6) with calories at 1400ish. Also stay at home mom and I also am on birth control (if that matters)

keto,My KETO plan that simply works,"Mike's KETO Plan

Stage #1:
Your 1st 30 days you should focus just on staying under 20g of carbs a day and finding foods that are palatable for you.  Eat enough fat to feel full and don't really focus on calories.  The removal of sugar from your diet will be a drastic enough change to show results without the need for a caloric deficit.  Also remember during the first few weeks your body is transitioning from sugar burning to fat.  It takes time and you may feel the effects lovingly known at KETO flu.  Stay hydrated and replenish electrolytes daily using mio energy,  supplements and tons of water.  Salt on your food becomes your friend and use it often as the foods you're now eating contain little to no sodium.  The way you feel will pass and you will feel much better.  Think of all that sugar as poison and you're going through withdrawal like symptoms.  Just hang in there you got this!! 

Stage#2
For your 2nd 30 days or month number two you should now have a good stable meal plan and can focus on maintaining your 20g carb limit but also include a calorie deficit to encourage weight loss.  Do a quick online search for a calorie calculator and insert your measurements.   A general rule of thumb is to reduce your calorie requirements from the calculation by ~500 a day.  Generally for women its around 1300-1500 and men 1700-2000.  You may also find this easier if you reduce your meals to only 2 meals a day.  I found eating 2 meals a day in the 700-800 calorie range and 10g of carbs each left me full and satiated.   I basically just skipped breakfast and ate brunch and dinner.  The sooner you can get comfortable with this the easier stage 3 is. 

Stage#3:
Onto month numbers 3-6  At this point you either gave up lol 😆 or you finally understand the buzz around being in ketosis and that it's not just a fad.  At this point you should continue doing everything you have done for the past two months and now add 16-8  intermittent fasting.  All this means is your meals should all be had within an 8 period.   We call this the feeding window and outside your feeding window you should be eating nothing.  During your 16 hour fasting window you should only be consuming black coffe, tea, water, and occassionally diet soda and absolutely no food of any kind.  This promotes fat loss at a greater rate and will help you overcome any plateaus.  You will maintain this for a minimum of 3 months but if you like where you are at you can continue stage 3 indefinitely.   I personally was at stage 3 for almost 3 years before attempting stage 4. 

Stage 4:  If you made it to stage 4 you likely now realize the huge benefits of KETO as a life long change.  Good for you.  You probably lost some friends along the way over your incessant discussion of KETO 🤣 and many of your friends are sick of hearing about it, however others now see the new you and are asking you for tips 😄.  At this point you may have hit a plateau once again.  The human body is very resilient and can get stuck in a comfortable rut of sorts.  This is where I transitioned into KETO OMAD or one meal a day.  You apply all the other rules of stages 1-3 except your feeding window is now only 1 hour a day and your fasting time is now 23 hours or 23-1.  This may sound extreme and maybe even difficult and not for everyone but if you really want to keep your weight loss going and break any plateau I will guarantee this is the way to go.  There is science to back up these claims and more research is being done.  

I am not a doctor or a nutritionist and any diet should be conducted with the direct supervision of your health care professionals. I can only attest to what has worked for me and countless others that have asked for my advice.  

Put down the chips, pick up the bacon and enjoy the delicious ride.  Cheers"

keto,Keto Trim,"keto Trim is a formula that provides ready-to-use ketone bodies to jump-start one’s keto weight loss journey. The ketogenic diet is taking the fitness and wellbeing industry by storm, and keto supplements to support this are becoming wildly popular.

**The ketogenic diet – it’s popular because it works**  
The basic idea of a keto diet is to use stored fat as energy instead of sugar from one’s diet. By sticking to a strictly low-carb / high-fat / adequate-protein food intake, one’s metabolism becomes tuned to processing fat.

**‘Ketone bodies’ – the key to ketogenic diets**  
Ketogenesis is the natural process where your liver converts fats into ketone bodies, which can then be used as fuel for your brain and muscles. Ketosis is when you're using up ketone bodies rather than sugar as fuel. Keto Trim is a high-quality source of those ketone bodies as healthy salts (the patented goBHB®).

**Avoiding ‘keto flu’ with Keto Trim**  
Restricting carbohydrates in your diet and getting into ketosis can be difficult. Some people feel lethargic and hazy during the changeover from high-carb to low-carb diet, and this has been dubbed the 'keto flu'. Although short-lived, keto flu can influence one's commitment to the diet.

Consuming exogenous ketone bodies (goBHB®) can support ketosis directly, avoiding keto flu and easing those cheat-meal hiccups.

Keto Trim is made in the US in an FDA registered facility that follows GMP guidelines. Ingredients in the formula are both domestic and imported."

Finding things to eat on the fly was limiting and boring.

we’ve agreed to switch to a healthier lifestyle than what we had before all this. this means introducing carbs, fruit, and other things keto didn’t permit but still are healthy for the body. is there a way to do this without gaining weight back and to continue losing weight?

Once I moved closer to work I just kept the bad habits. I live in Shanghai. I wish I could blame lockdowns or something else .... It was just me being lazy and finding an excuse. I recently went to a trampoline park and stepped on the scale. Holy Sh**. Was down to a maintenance weight of 195-205. Now back up to 255.  Already this week smoked chicken drumsticks, fried bacon,  scrambled eggs, and a grilled a ribeye. Taste better then the quick delivery (though now I need to was dishes). It reminded me of how delicious and Keto home cooking can be. I may not get the food as quickly as delivery (less than 30 for a full on smorgasbord from KFC)... But I know my stomach, knees, and self esteem will be thankful.  Also getting the energy level back up to functional.
No reason for this post other than just to hold myself accountable. Cheers!"
keto,Yet another ‘why am I not losing’ post,"I know people ask this all the time but I’m really in a world of frustration right now. I’ve been trying to lose weight since the first of the year... slowly eased into keto the first two weeks and then I’ve been doing pretty good on keto ever since. Plus around that time my boyfriend and I joined a gym and work out four times a week. This is a 30 minute HIIT/CrossFit type class so it’s pretty intense and it’s not like I’m just walking on a treadmill. 

This is our fourth week at the gym and probably my fourth week really doing well (staying with macros, drinking less alcohol, drinking more water) on keto.

My boyfriend is down 10 pounds and he’s not even really doing keto… He’ll eat what I eat when we’re together but then he will eat whatever he wants the rest of the time (regular soda, multiple cocktails every night, sweets when he wants them etc)

I have not lost more than a single pound. I was down 4 pounds and then I gained it back somehow and now I can’t seem to lose a single pound.

I’m 5’6” and I weigh 170.. 20 of which has been gained in the last year. I would like to lose the 20 and maybe an additional 10. I feel like it shouldn’t be this hard. I’ve done keto in the past and had much better success than I’m having this time around. 

I just started taking my measurements yesterday. However my clothes don’t fit any different than they did at the first of the year. 

Is it possible that keto just no longer works for me? I desperately would like to try intermittent fasting but for the life of me I can’t refrain from eating anything in the morning until 11. I wake up hungry at 7:30. Does it get easier? If I just suffer through it for a couple of days while I adjust?

I just feel disheartened because I went from completely sedentary and drinking a lot of alcohol and not eating the best to a complete 180 and I’m not seeing any results. 

I have a trip to Florida planned at the end of February and the end of March and I’m not gonna be able to fit into any of my summer clothes. Ugh! What can I do?

Sorry this was long. Thank you to anyone who comments!"
keto,"HELP! - Long Plateau, and NOTHING works - Even gained a pound on strict Keto Egg Fast","I keep to a strict Keto diet,  I am 5'8"", and have gone from 232 to 201 in 6 months, but NOTHING since early december.  There was maybe 10 days cheating around holidays, but have since tried everything to break the plateau at around 201.  I do not cheat, I keep calories around 1,500 max (or less).  

I have tried everything since Jan 4 to break plateau...Keto +Intermittent fast 16/8, KEto+24 hour full fast, Keto Egg fast - NOTHING.  I even tried 2 weeks keto maintenance at 2,000 calories to ""re-set"".  NOTHING!!! same weight.

ANY IDEAS TO HELP - would be so appreciated!"
keto,"The easy two ingredient low carb ""porridge""/""oatmeal"" alternative.","Before I went keto, porridge was one of my favourite foods. Over the last few years I have experimented with a variety of the recipes online, but none of the complicated and time consuming options ever imitated the texture or flavour of porridge. So I decided to experiment myself and struck gold with this ridiculuously simple 2-ingredient recipe.

Makes 1 very generous portion:

- 100g Almond Butter
- 200ml Milk (Use a brand with less sugar)

- (Optional) A pinch of salt
- (Optional) Your favourite keto-friendly sweetener

1. Mix in a large bowl or dish. The almond butter is sticky but will separate into strands after a small amount of agitation in the milk.
2. Microwave for 5 minutes on low (Be careful to ensure it doesn't boil over). Take out halfway through to stir.
3. If you wish, mix in a pinch of salt and your favourite low carb sweetener to taste.

Yep that's it. The almond butter I buy has 6.9g carbs per 100g &amp; the milk I use has 2.7g per 100ml so this very filling portion adds up to around 12.3 grams carbs. However, your milage will vary based on where you source your ingredients."
keto,I need to get into deep ketosis and intermittent fasting but I can't!,"*The condition I describe below happened to me in the past when I was trying to get into intermittent fasting and deep ketosis, all symptoms went away after I started eating regularly again.*

Recently, I stopped smoking, ate once a day and dropped carbs to zero.

Currently, I wake up with pain in my neck from acid reflux and it gets worse after I eat. I get a neck lump sensation which persists almost all day and makes it really hard to do any productive work while I also feel generally lethargic and weak (even muscle weakness).

After long periods of fasting (+23hrs) for more than a week I wasn't getting enough salt, potassium and magnesium. I had diarrhea twice. I was eating late at night and then lay on my bed with a laptop on top of my stomach for a few hours before I sleep. I also had eyelid twitching (tetany) which still persists but less often.

I bought some sea salt and apple cider vinegar and I plan on drinking it three times a day while eating a big salad everyday.

I think the transition was too sudden for my body to adjust. What I haven't mentioned is that I was doing less strict keto and I.F. for less hours successfully (lost 40 pounds)."
keto,Help me make a list of goal NSVs,"For a year or so, I’ve slowly added to a note in my phone of a list of “goals” for when I’m thinner. I’d love to hear some of yours! 

I’ve lost enough wait that I’ve been able to cross a few off already, and it’s an amazing feeling.

A few of mine:
- Not be designated to shotgun automatically when the back seat is full. 
- Not worry about fitting on a roller coaster.
- Be able to be picked up.
- Have collar bones that show. 
- Be able to borrow clothes. 
- Have a standard size towel wrap fully around me."
keto,What if we no longer want to lose weight?,"Help! 

My husband and I started keto last week. We have been trying to conceive for 2.5 years, and hoping that Keto may “fix” my potential PCOS diagnosis. 
I’m a 31 yo F, 62” SW 129– don’t really have a “goal weight,” but previously hovered around 120 prior to all of our infertility treatments.  I’m down to 124.6 as of today. Hoping to keep this as a lifestyle, and not focus so much on my weight. 
My macros: 20 g Carbs, 72g Protein, 84g Fat, calories 1,124


My husband, 31 year old male, 70”, SW 158,  is down to 150 already after a week. I realize at some point the weight loss slows, but worried he’s going to keep losing at the rate he’s at. What changes can he make to maintain his weight where it’s at? He has already increased his carbs from 20g to 25g and adjusted to “maintain” on MyFitnessPal— 
Based on the keto calculators his macros are as follows: 
156g Fat
106g Protein
1928 calories 

What adjustments can he make for him to meet his goals with them being significantly higher than mine? He’s also been unable to reach his fat macro pretty much since starting. 
Sorry, super scattered post. Would appreciate your thoughts!"
keto,How to drink more water?,"Hello experts! I am planning on starting keto in a few weeks or so. Right now, I’m weaning myself off of soda, making my lists, gathering supplies and supplements, reducing my overall calorie intake, just sort laying the groundwork to transition into a keto lifestyle.

In doing all my research (big thanks to all of the info here!) I’ve run into what might be one of my bigger problems, and that is that I just do not drink enough water. 

In general, I don’t drink unless I’m eating. I only drink when I’m feeling thirsty and I really don’t feel thirsty unless I’m eating. Based on everything I’ve learned, staying hydrated super important, and I’m worried that I’ll struggle in general because I’m struggle to choke down more water.

I’ve tried downloading a tracking app, and I’ve been drinking from a glass with measurements on it, but all it’s doing is basically showing me how much I’m NOT drinking. Does anyone have any tips for getting back on that water wagon?"
keto,I look at low carb recipes and foods so differently now,"I started Keto Jan 1 and at first eating a dish that was say 6 gm net carbs seemed so low carb to me. Now when I see a recipe or food that says it’s low carb, but it’s 6 gm net carbs per serving, I think wow that’s a lot of carbs and I don’t want to spend so many of my 20 gm of net carbs on that! I was reading the label on my shirataki noodles last night and saw one serving was 6 gm carbs. I was shocked! I will stick to my hearts of palm instead."
keto,Can low-carb/Keto affect blood work?,"I’m going to get blood work done in a week, the reason I’m doing Keto is to try and stop the hair loss I’m having from suspected PCOS; I’m still trying to figure out what’s going on with my body.
NOTE: I’m by no means doing Keto for health or weight loss, literally just to try and do something to help my hairloss/potential PCOS

I’ve been doing lowcarb/Keto for the last 2 weeks, but I was wondering if this will affect my blood work and if I should stop till I get the bloods done so they can more accurately reflect my levels when eating how I normally would?

I’m trying to get to the bottom of whether my issues are related to some kind of deficiency, hormones, thyroid, PCOS, all of that. BONUS QUESTION: if anyone knows exactly what I should ask to be looked at in the bloods do let me know, thanks!"
keto,Anyone else keep a kitchen scale in their desk at work or in their car?,"The first scale I bought lacked a few features that I would've liked.  I'm too frugal to replace a scale that mostly works fine though.  I found the best solution was to take that one into work and pickup a new more feature-rich scale for home.  Its been so nice having a scale in my desk at work.  It easily allows me to keep track of just how much I've ate.

I'm curious if anyone else keeps scales in non-kitchen settings just so that they have them when needed."
keto,Keto junk food requests,"Every year for my mom's birthday it's become a tradition that I start her birthday morning off with a homemade cake and a big pile of all of the things I know that she likes but won't ever buy for herself, like candles, bath products, etc. Included in this are all of her favorite junk foods, as she's really into pasta and bread. It's a once a year thing of being a little unhealthy as a splurge. This year though she's gotten really serious about keto and I want to support her while still keeping up our once a year tradition, so I'm trying to replace the usual stuff with keto friendly junk food and I need some suggestions. 

I plan to try baking with almond flour and a sugar substitute to see how that works out, but as far as snacks I'm at a loss. So far my list only includes some nice salami and parm crisps. And again, I know this isn't  sustainable way to do keto and all junk food is still junk food regardless if it's keto or not, that's not the point. It's just a once a year splurge with some unhealthier options just for her birthday and isn't meant to be a frequent thing. Any and all suggestions are appreciated, and thank you in advance for your help!"
keto,Keto Victory!,"I wanted to share with you all that I got some blood work done a couple weeks ago and everything was good, and ketone levels were good. I was honestly so afraid of going to the doctor for years because I was scared they’d tell me I was pre-diabetic. I decided to go after starting keto as part of my decision to start taking my health seriously, so I’m not sure what my pre-keto blood work looked like. I’m just so glad they told me everything was normal and there was no mention of diabetes!"
keto,"Keto Superpowers - My Experience With Weight Loss, Anxiety, Depression, and Sleep","I attempted Keto twice in the past. For some reason both those attempts failed at becoming fat adapted. I felt slow, lightheaded, weak, had a rapid heart rate, and generally like my body was failing to accept living without carbs. As someone who could run 10 miles after eating a bowl of rice, I couldn't even run down the street. 

As a 27 year old male, I've been very blessed to not have to deal with any major health issues, however I have struggled with a plethora of smaller things that have no doubt, hindered my quality of life.  These mainly being anxiety, depression/mania, bipolar tendencies, and sleep issues. Most of these are inherited, as my parents and other family members suffer from these psychological disorders. I am a high functioning person, with a degree and a well paying corporate job; so these disorders are not enough to cripple me (yet), but enough to still really damage me and my relationships with those around me. 

At least that's how things were before Keto. 

Before I would have so much anxiety that I would stutter, lose my balance at times, get massive brain fog, had to completely avoid caffeine, and would sometimes get a panic attack. My depression/mania would come in waves. That's where the bipolar tendencies I believe exist. Every couple weeks I'd go through some spell where I'd be really depressed or where I'd feel invincible and on top of the world. My emotions were a rollercoaster. I was using high intensity exercise like mixed martial arts as a crutch to control my anxiety. The really high intensity workouts stimulated enough positive chemicals in my brain to relax me throughout my weeks and control my mental issues. However if I went anymore than 3-4 days of having those workouts, my anxiety would flare up. If I missed more than a week or 2, I would almost become incapable of basic human tasks like showering or doing laundry.

Sleep was also a huge issue for me. I struggled so much to get to work on time at 9AM, and it would take me hours to really wake up. I'd awake groggy, irritable, in a haze, with my eyes still watery and with sleep in them. It really affected my work performance, especially during project deadlines where we needed to be at work early and ready to rock.

Controlling my weight was also a huge battle. No matter how much I worked out, no matter how much I followed ""CICO"", its like my body just found a way to hold onto my fat. I was mildly overweight, not obese, but still 10-20lbs outside a healthy weight range for my height. I was eating ""healthy."" Fruits vegetables, lean meats, whole grains, and trying to eat slightly below maintenance calories. I was frequently running 5-10 miles, lifting weights, and walking almost 10k steps a day, yet my clothes were still tight, I still had a considerable amount of fat, and just felt bad about the way I looked as a man.

3 months ago, I finally got Keto to work and got fat adapted. The effects were nothing short of a miracle. Some may want to call it a placebo, and go right ahead. If it is a placebo, then its a placebo that I want to continue with. 

My anxiety and depression were reduced by 95%. Nothing else in my life changed besides diet. Same job, same friends, same living situation, same activity levels. In fact, my activity levels increased, despite not having carbs. 

I realized something was going right when I was able to have caffeine again, was waking up at 6:30AM and it only taking 5 minutes to wake up. I am now working 50 hours a week, training MMA/lifting weights each day after work for 1-3 hours, have incredible mental focus that lasts the entire day, being productive on weekends and maintaining every other part of my life. I've even got with a friend who wants to start going out more and meeting/dating new people at dance clubs (which used to be a huge fear of mine). The great thing is, I don't need to eat as much. The other day I worked 10 hours and did 3 full hours of brutal MMA training, all on 1 single meal. I've lost weight, look great, feel great in my clothes and feel good when I look in the mirror. 

I'm not a doctor or a psychologist. I can't prove scientifically that this diet is for everyone or healthy long term, but it really improved my quality of life. I have a book called ""Sapiens"" by Yuval Noah Harari, and it's about human evolution. It mentions how wheat and grains really weren't developed and spread around the globe until less than 10,000 years ago. For the millions of years of prior human evolution, we were hunter-gatherers eating meats and plants. I really wonder if this is a large part of why people today become overweight and laden with many psychological problems - because they're fueling their body with something we aren't fully adapted to. 

The only thing I need help with now, is putting on muscle. I recently tried going back to carbs because muscle gaining has been quite difficult on Keto. It's really hard for me to eat enough. My stomach really starts to hurt when I eat over maintenance. So I tried carbs again the other day. Immediately my anxiety came raging back. I felt awful, struggled at the gym, and cried in my car for absolutely no reason on the way back. So it looks like I have no choice but to stick with Keto for now.

The only concerns I have are of eating red meat too often and with gaining muscle effectively without carbs. I hope someone can find my story useful and if anyone has any tips for me, please let me know."

keto,“Trust the Process” frustration,"About two years ago I (47F) adopted the keto lifestyle, loved it, lost 61lbs and I felt incredible. Those 61lbs took me about a year to lose, it was steady and not so dramatic that it was shock to the system. 
Some bumps in life happened, I ended up gaining back about 40lbs, felt horrible on all levels and I knew I needed to get my act together. 
I’m back to eating the keto way, after a month, I feel amazing (joints don’t hurt, less cravings, sleeping better, etc), but the weight is slooooow to shed. Like hardly moving, way less than before. I know I need to “trust the process”, I know it works! I know the benefits! I know the topics to avoid talking to others about 😆 (can I get an amen?!). I know I need to continue marching forward, but I’m frustrated.  
Every day I repeat a million times “trust the process”, but it is followed by internal screams for the scale to move. I do have to share that my pants are a smidge looser, but I want those numbers to move too. There is  just some satisfaction saying I lost X, make sense? 
Anyone else experience this?"
keto,Keto and Diabetes,"I'm 65 years old, carrying 182 lbs on a 5'8"" frame. Ideally, I would like to lose around 20 lbs.

keto,Kakato - the perfect BAKING sweetener,"After multiple disappointments and failures from allulose, bochasweet(xylose), erythritol and its various blend with other sweeteners, I finally found a perfect sweetener for cookies. 

Kakato is a mix of low glycemic sugar tagatose, inulin, stevia and monkfruit extract. I am sure that we know about inulin, stevia and monkfruit, but tagatose is rarely explored in both proper sensory analysis or normal bakers. Tagatose is a monosaccharide, but it has supposedly same functionalities with sucrose, a disaccharide...this is VERY important in baking because you don't want the sugar to burn too fast (allulose) and spread out, or just spread out (xylose). You want sugars to caramelize/maillard and retain some kind of gooeyness in the cookies, which is where all the other sweeteners fail. 

I just made cookies with REGULAR wheat flours simply to test its viability in baking - also it's cheap. The end result was perfect. IT's gooey like a regular sugar chocolate chip cookies, crinkly center, and crackling outside that you see from regular chocolate chip cookies. I spent about 47 bucks for three containers (7lb), and I do not regret one bit. I bought directly from the Silver Fern not Amazon to save some costs. 

Please test it out, and tell me how it works for you!"

Week 3: 179 average 
Week 4: 177.8 average

Weigh in today: 176.7 ( 177.3 average)

I’m losing an average of under.5 pounds per week. 

Cutting back on calories. Measuring everything I consume with MyFitnessPal. 

I’m still 42.3-52.3 pounds away from my ultimate goal weight of 125-135 pounds. 27.3 pounds away from my highest healthy weight of 150. Which means I’d no longer be overweight. 

I can’t understand why my weight is dropping off so slowly. At the rate I’ve been going it would take me over a year just to get down to a healthy weight of 150. And close to 2 years to lose 52.3 pounds and reach my ultimate goal weight. 

I don’t expect to lose more then 2 pounds or so max per week. Which is a healthy weight loss. But half a pound or less each week just seems far too slow."

keto,"5 Weeks in, persistent Brain Fog - Push through or adjust?","So I really did my best to adhere to SKD for 5 weeks now. Blood ketones 0.6-1.7 after waking throughout this period. I was an already lean individual pretty used to fasting and eating low-ish carb with no weight goals, 100% looking for energy and mental benefits.

I can definitely feel some signs of adaptation such as being able to finish a workout or a sprint without dying and recover well the next day (which was unthinkable during the first 2 weeks), going longer hours without eating, no hunger, zero cravings, feeling energetic after a fatty meal, etc..

However, on the mental side I only seem to get dumber. Even though my ability to react to situations that require immediate action is solid, whenever I have to focus and do some deeper thinking my brain goes blank. Short-term memory and verbal fluidity also seems worse. And that only seems to be only getting worse over time.

Assuming I'm doing perfect electrolytes, macros and everything by the book, would you say it's time to push through the symptoms and wait longer or I should think about adjusting my carb intake?"
keto,I noticed as a side effect from tracking macros that writing down everything I eat has made me super aware and personally accountable.," I (m 37 275lbs) have had a severe binging disorder since i was a child. I've never been able to use moderation or(feel) the right amounts of food to eat. I have noticed though , while tracking macros SO much about my self and my disorder. 

  I know binge eating isn't considered as serious as bulimia or anorexia, but, i think it's important to remember that you are fighting a serious demon. Even if you aren't ready to diet or start keto just yet, i say track your macros just to know yourself! 

   This is just something i learned about myself , hopefully it helps someone else."

I feel amazing on keto don't get me wrong, but I'm someone who gets months worth of motivation from the numbers dropping a bit.

I started keto in September 2019, I lost 7 stone (98 pounds). 
I decided to have christmas this year off plan and eat the stuff I've missed over the past year and half. 
I went back on keto after having 5 days off and everything was fine. If I am honest by the end off day 2 I hated not been on keto, I felt awful.

I weighed myself in the middle of January and I had gained 1 stone! (14 pounds) i was so shocked.
Since then I have been loosing and gaining the same couple of pounds. 
I do not know what I  doing wrong?
I am going to order some mtc oil and collagen powder and start intermittent fasting again. 

As this happened to anyone else please? 
The only thing that i have been doing different is I have been eating a different brand of pork scratchings and having sugar free sryrp in my bullet proof coffee which is also keto friendly.

keto,Fasted Ketosis vs Diet Ketosis,"    Way Back December 2019, I began intermittent fasting. This was way before I discovered anything on lowcarb or keto. The pandemic happened and I religiously fasted for 18 hours a day. I lost 10 kilograms in the span of 6 months by just fasting.

     I understand that prolonged fasting puts you in a ketogenic state. The same effect can also be achieved through maintaining a carb intake of less than 20 grams per day. Since both ways deplete your glycogen, is the state of ketosis achieved equal among these two methods? I am aware that they are synergistic in that keto makes fasting way easier. But out of curiosity, if person A were to not eat for 3 days, and person B ate keto for 3 days, would their levels of ketosis be the same?"
keto,6 lbs in a week,"First time I started a keto diet last week and I lost 6 lbs. Granted it may just be a lot of water weight, but I’m very pleased to continue because this works! I workout Mon, Wed, and Fri while sticking to a strict intermittent fasting during the week. On the weekends I can eat all day but I watch my intake. I already feel better than I did a couple weeks ago! Just wanted to share my progress. To everyone else, good luck and continue to knockout your weight loss journey. I’m rooting for y’all!

keto,My results from doing keto,"  I'm pretty close to the goal I set for myself a while ago, I had tried many other things to lose weight but keto seemed to work the best for me. I only drink water these days and eat 1 or 2 big salads along with some fruit occasionally. A lot of the anxiety and depression problems I had seemed to disappear when I stopped consuming refined carbs as well. I hope other people are able to reach their goal on here, I really enjoy seeing people's posts because it makes me feel good knowing that people are finding something that works for them. Anyway here is a picture of my results. I'm somewhere slightly above 6 feet tall and the picture on the left is me at  around 335lbs and on the right is at 215lbs. Thanks for checking out my post

keto,Need motivation!!,"Hi there! This is my third round with keto. Two years ago, I was dating a guy who had been doing keto for a year or so. It made it easy to lose 45 pounds in about 6 months, but it was a toxic relationship. After breaking up with him (for the 6th and final time!) I gained all the weight back.  I started keto again in July or August 2020 and dropped about 20 lbs... then I met the love of my life. I put on “happy weight,” “covid weight,” and “oh shit I fell off the keto wagon” weight.  I’m struggling to stick with it. I will be doing well, seeing the numbers decrease on the scale, then a holiday or special event comes along and I go off keto “just for today,” which turns into a weekend, a week, etc.  My SO is supportive and is pretty good about not eating carbs in front of me, but he really doesn’t enjoy eating low-carb. On Dec 28, I took all my measurements, recorded them in my diary and determined to get healthy. Since then, I have stopped and started keto at least 3 times.  Any sage advice for how to stop sabotaging myself? I do really well, am super motivated, then get these (seemingly) insatiable cravings and carbo-load. ☹️

In an effort to add some accountability, here are my stats:
I am 5’4”. On Dec 28, I weighed 208.
Right now, I weigh 211.    Ouch."
keto,Struggling to eat enough fat....,"I’ve started keto about two weeks ago and have never really met the proper fat intake, I eat pretty much maybe 1-2g of carbs a day and most food I eat is either eggs or chicken. I started at 180lbs and am now 169lbs (water weight maybe) 


Will not eating enough fat effect my weight loss in a negative way? Or effect it in a positive way?"
keto,"The Carb Bloat is real, the difference of 7lbs lost and losing water weight in about 3 weeks","Okay, so this basically my keeping in check post cause I have stopped and started keto for the past three months trying to get to my goal weight. I honestly just wanted quick fast foods hence why I kept going off keto. But then looking at this progress picture from a month ago, I’m even more motivated to keep going this time. No cheats, no excuses. I was bloated af and so undisciplined. I just did not feel great. I began keto again mid January with limited exercise and 1500kcal daily limit, 20net carbs. The extra effort of having to meal plan and cook at home is well worth not feel lethargic like that.

I really want to stay on keto but I don’t know if I should  spend a few days eating carbs to make it go away and then start back up again, or just try and handle it until I reach my goal weight. Im planning to do low carb rather then full on keto once I hit my goal weight. 
I’ve got another 40lbs to lose. 

Fyi It takes me around two days to get back into ketosis. 

Help! I don’t want to lose any gains I have made."
keto,Does anyone worry about the long term health effects of Keto,On an old Joe Rogan podcast Brock Lesnar was talking about how he had to have surgery to remove one foot of his colon due to following a high protein high fat diet for years.

keto,Should Women Avoid The Keto Diet?,"The Keto Diet has become quite a popular topic in the fitness community. It has been found to aid in the loss of weight and lowering the inflammation in the gut. New research has shown positive effects for both men and women adhering to a keto style diet.  
[What is the Keto Diet?](https://sites.google.com/view/health-and-fitness-03/home)  
First, a keto, or ketogenic diet, is designed to keep your body in more of a ketosis state. Ketosis is not abnormal. It is a state where your body is low on carbohydrate fuel. When this occurs, it starts to burn fat, rather than the carbs. The process produces ketones. The average person does not stay in a ketogenic state except during heavy exercise, such as CrossFit, or during pregnancy.  
A ketogenic diet promotes very low carbohydrate and higher fat intake. The body will in turn, use fat to produce energy. This diet has also been shown to decrease autoimmune diseases, endocrine diseases, and also has cancer fighting properties.  
Ketosis can be an issue with diabetics. This can occur if not using enough insulin.  
[How does Keto benefit CrossFit athletes?](https://sites.google.com/view/health-and-fitness-03/home)  
As stated earlier, a ketogenic diet helps to burn fat, thus losing weight. This low carb diet is similar to the Paleo Diet. We are a strong proponent of Paleo because it promotes higher protein for fuel instead of carbs. As we stated earlier, the keto diet uses fat rather than protein for fuel. A keto and paleo diet both burn fat while maintaining muscle.  
An athlete exercising at a high level, such as CrossFit, will see increased energy and fat loss, without decreasing muscle mass.

  
[Why is the Keto Diet good for women?](https://sites.google.com/view/health-and-fitness-03/home)  
The benefits of being a woman on this diet are surprisingly good. In addition to the weight loss and muscle gain, a keto diet has an amazing way of helping the endocrine system. We all realize the effect hormones have on the woman athlete.  
Fluctuating hormones can cause pain, fatigue, and even depression. The link between hormones and cancer cannot be denied. A keto diet has shown to better regulate the endocrine system. By doing this, it decreases the incidence of some cancers, thyroid disease, and diabetes.  
[How does a women initiate a keto diet?](https://sites.google.com/view/health-and-fitness-03/home)  
Slowly and carefully. A keotgenic diet should not be started at a full 100 percent. You should slowly decrease the amount of carbs you consume. Cutting the carbs too quickly can actually have a negative effect. It can stress the body and confuse it, thus causing a wild imbalance.  
Also, if pregnant or nursing, you should not use a keto diet. During this period, eat a well-rounded diet of fruits, vegetables, dairy, and grains.  
My best advice, get your body as stable as possible, and then slowly incorporate a ketogenic diet."
keto,Reflecting on one year of Keto!,"My doctor recommended keto after blood tests revealed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). At only 25 years old hearing that although you barely drink, you have the liver function of an alcoholic is pretty startling and enough to push me to make the change. 

This is my first ever post on Reddit and I could probably write a whole novel on what the experience has been. 

One year ago my stomach and bowel flare-ups controlled my life. They dictated nearly everything I did as I was so afraid of a flare up on a road trip or at a work function etc. In the entire year since I changed my eating habits, I have had fewer than five total flare ups compared to at least two per week before. 

After changing my food, other healthy habits followed like increased exercise, self-care time, and far more reading to name a few. 

Changing my lifestyle has given me so much. Even though I’ve never posted, this community has been a huge part of my transformation and I guess I just want to say thank you!

Oh! And I reversed my NAFLD with my blood work back in the normal range, and lost 98 pounds in the process."
keto,What are the chances of keto diet causing keto acidosis??,"So it's not like I have diabetes or hypoglycemia or anything of the sort. but I didn't know keto acidosis was a thing until already being like 2.5 weeks into keto. just wondering if this is something that happens semi-often, or if this is hella rare. can't seem to find a concrete answer about it from a simpler Google search lol. I'm also supplementing with potassium, magnesium, vitamin d, b12, MCT, ltheanine, and some BHB thing. Idk if that makes a difference as far as acidosis goes. Any advice or answers would be great 😬"
keto,Keto with aFib?,"Has anyone been doing keto with atrial fibrillation, more commonly referred to as aFib? I was all psyched to go keto and a nurse friend of mine said it was the wrong diet for someone with aFib and that I should follow the American Heart Association diet. I'd rather do keto. What do others think here? I know my health is my responsibility and that I must talk to my own doctor. I'm really just looking to see what others have done as a source of discussion with my cardiologist."
keto,Chronometer,"How do I get Chronometer to show me my macros instead of my calories? I don’t care about calories. I care about macros. I know calories are a thing that exists but they don’t tell me anything that helps me track my macros. 

Stupid Carb Manager. They were so good until today. Cronometer is confusing me."
keto,Keto Meals,"Hi, I am interesting in trying keto with intermittent fasting to lose some weight. I have always been buff in my life, but I want to shed some of the fat along with muscle and have a slimmer look. I am wondering how much body fat I would lose if I did around 30 min of cardio 5 days per week and lifted weights for an hour 5 days per week. I would have a diet consisting of 2 eggs with cheese cooked in butter everyday along with some greek yogurt. I would then eat 8oz of salmon for lunch around 3PM with low carb vegetables cooked with butter and olive oil. In between these meals during the day I would snack on some almonds. If I did this everyday for around 90 days, what kind of weight loss do you think I would see? I would be achieving a 16:8 fast, maybe even longer of a fast if I eat lunch earlier in the day. I would make sure to drink a lot of water during the day."
keto,Tips,"New to Keto? This might help!

1. Ghee/Beef Tallow

I love cooking with ghee, it has a high smoke point so it’s better for high heat cooking than oil, super easy (and cheap) to make at home, and a great easy way to get extra fat. Beef tallow is great for no/neutral flavor, also has a high smoke point.

2. Bacon/eggs

Best keto breakfast to me, simple quick and filling! I do 3 slices bacon and 2 eggs fried in bacon grease, really great way for getting a lot fat and a good amount of protein!

3. Carbs/Vegetables

I actually struggle with getting in a good amount of carbs, so carrots are my go to carb booster. I mostly eat broccoli and salad greens (not much of an avocado fan), and those are pretty low in net carbs, so I eat carrots to make up the difference. 1 cup has a lot of net carbs, so it’s great if you have a hard time meeting your carb needs plus the added health benefits are a bonus.

3. Homemade salad dressing/sauces 

Salad dressings made out of olive oil, Mayo, or other good quality fats are an excellent way to get a lot of fat. I personally like Babish’s salad dressing recipes and get a lot of my fats through that. I also have an Alfredo sauce with heavy whipping cream and butter that has a lot of fat. Fatty sauces/dressings can be super helpful for incorporating more fat!

Bonus: I found some bread at the store called UnBun/UnBread, made a really great fat-packed bacon cheeseburger with the bun, cut up a slice of bread and tossed it in ghee and toasted them to make croutons. So far the best keto bread I’ve had period and the ingredients are all great too. 

Hope this helped someone!"

My husband and I are doing this together, so that is helpful. I am tried Noom and Weight Watchers with minimal success. I have also been doing intermittent fasting for over a year now, mostly 16:8. I lost about 20 pounds doing that, but have just been maintaining my weight."
keto,if i'm doing keto while dieting do i need to keep my macros the same or can i increase the protein?,for example lets say i'm only gonna eat 800 calories today.  does it still have to be the same ratio of protein:fat as usual (40:60 i think)  or can i raise the protein so it's something like 600 cal from protein and 200 cal from fat  instead of the usual ratio which would be more like 350 cal protein and 450 cal from fat
keto,Is Keto a sustainable diet?,"Hello! I am super interested and excited to do Keto. I have always struggled with losing weight. Over the two years, I stopped exercising completely because of an autoimmune disease that hit me hard (still under diagnosis because of lack of insurance and cost of testing). There was point of time where I could barely walk to the kitchen without crying out in pain but now I’m on medication that helps with swelling. The medication hurts my stomach a lot and I want to see if this diet could possible help my body feel a little better. I know it won’t get rid of my autoimmune disease completely, but I know certain life style changes can help. 

My bf’s aunt did Keto and lost a lot of weight and that encouraged me to do research. I found this Reddit community and have seen that a lot of people have been doing this for a few years. My bf is currently a culinary major and had to take a nutrition class and told me that Keto is something you do for a few months and then stop. He mentioned that his aunt stopped with the strict Keto and just eats healthier now. I told him I would do more research and reach out on here just to hear people’s first hand experiences."

keto,1 Year Ketoversary,"I am not really a poster or even a lurker, but I think I have something to say that could help those who are currently like I was, a carb addicted overeater.

I 25M started keto last year at 5'11"", 273 lbs and in a bad place.  I had been obese since I was about 10 and I believed that losing weight was impossible.  It was probably the dozens of sources of conflicting advice that solidified this unhealthy mindset.

After deciding keto was real and likely the most efficient way to lose the weight, I was worried if I could actually stay away from things like chocolate or pizza.

Thankfully, I was able to overcome my emotional eating and overeating (which I think of as 2 separate issues) and I am currently 179 lbs.  My life is still hard, but now I have the energy to make progress towards my goals.  It is mind boggling to me how every aspect of my life has improved.  I can't attribute all of those successes to keto itself, but rather the mindset that small changes you make in your behavior are more meaningful than large decisions you make once.  I have always heard that a long journey begins with a single step, but I think it should be long journeys are entirely comprised of single steps.

I am not a nutritionist, but I do have some advice about behaviors that can reduce/eliminate the power cravings have over you.  First and most important, stay hydrated (both with water and electrolytes).  I realized that often my sugar cravings were actually a craving for salt.  Second, make your own food as often as possible.  This helps me be in control of exactly how much I am eating in a day.  Third, make meals in advanced.  I make 100% of my own food from scratch.  That's not exactly possible for most people, but for me that only means 2-3 six portion cooking sessions throughout a week (not including breakfast).  Fourth, water IS a snack.  If after eating my calories for the day and the cravings are still there, I snack on a big glass of water.  It keeps my mouth busy and my stomach feeling full.

Finally, if you are an emotional eater who eats when you're sad or stressed, keto won't fix that.  To fix it I had to both accept that as extremely unhealthy and find the source of that behavior in therapy.

All that sounds like a lot of work.  Maybe that sounds impossible for you, but I am telling the truth when I say even with intense cravings, the hardest part of weight loss was deciding when to buy new clothes.

I hope anyone thinking of starting keto or any diet focused on eating below maintenance calories can view it as an exciting opportunity to get more energy, cook delicious and healthy foods, and practice building healthy habits.

Change can be scary, but it can also be a change for the better.

Thank You"
keto,"30 months in on Keto, let's chat about it.","Okay so I started this whole thing 08/28/18. I was 360lb and suffering from a pretty severe binging disorder. I was sick all of the time, and my body hurt constantly like it was under too much pressure. I had skin issues. And allergic reactions to foods that now give me no trouble. I would bloat constantly, and I was so freaking hungry. I also really hated myself. I was pretty huge into bopo, thinking if I was positive enough and confident enough about my body, I would finally love it. Turns out thats not the way it worked for me. I just fell further into my binge eating and depression. Encasing myself in the armor of fat. I was legitimately numb in some spaces, because, I assume, I didn't have enough nerve endings to cover my mass. Idk. Thats a guess. 

So in August of '18 my best friend sat me down and told me she loved me, and I was cute as hell just the way I was, but if I was really unhappy I needed to change it, or be quiet. She was just about ready to start keto herself, But had a big life event to prepare for first. So I agreed to start that very day. 

I was 360lb, wearing a 5x top. And 4x bottoms that were (clearly) too small and stretched way too tight across me. My hips were 65inches around, and my waist was 55 inches. I could barely put the seat belt on in the front seat, and backseat belts never fit. Planes were a nightmare tbh. 

I got to 360lb because I have a binge eating disorder. I would eat 2-3 cheeseburgers, large fries, cokes, cookies, cakes, those little glazed pies at the grocery store? I ate THOUSANDS of calories every day. Donuts? By the dozen. I was absolutely lost in that sickness. Nothing made me feel good. The sugar barely tasted good anymore. When I was younger, sweets made me feel good for a long time. But in the midst of a 5 year binge... I was barely getting any joy while the sugar was on my tongue, let alone once I was done eating. So I just ate all of the time instead. It was... a lot. 

While gaining all of that weight I tried to love myself. I bought clothes that looked good in my head (reality is soooooo different), and enjoyed my cleavage and made people believe I loved being fat. Fat was beautiful dangit. And I was ready to make sure everyone believed it. Even if I didn't.
  It's hard to love yourself superficially. You can't just throw clothes on your body and tell it you love it. It knows you're lying. You know you're lying. Just like you can't buy your kids off, you can't buy yourself off. I had to be completely honest with myself. I was in so much pain. Inside. Outside. Emotional. Physical. I hurt in every way. I was screaming inside for help. So I took stock. Where was the pain coming from. What made it worse, what made it better? 

Obviously at first everything made it worse. I was 360 pounds! Much too large for a 5 foot 6 inch human!! But, Even though I was still hurting ,and also now without my comfort food escape, I was seeing changes. Benefits. Small ones at first. My swelling went down. Headaches lessened in frequency,  food tasted good again, my temper chilled out, and it wasn't unbearably hot all of the time.  Sweets were neccessary to me for the first 6 months or so. I was just making mug cakes and protein drinks and baking all the keto things. I actually lost my first 100 pounds during that initial phase of healing. 0

Once I hit 100 pounds gone, the pain had lessened to such a degree that I could do things like zumba and the treadmill! It made life easier in a lot of ways. But also much harder because I was ready for my skinny body. LOL, yall know what I mean. 6 months isn't long at all. And wanting my body NOW was very Veruka of me. But I forced myself into patience. The weightloss slowed down like we expected it to, but I still got below 200lb mark. It was incredible. ONEDERLAND! I'd made it!

Now here is where the slow down becomes fierce. We are a year and a half in. I'm ready. And taking my fitness to the next level. And stallllllllllll

I Stalled for 3 months before BLOOP suddenly 190. Then stallllllllll for 3 more months and blooP! 185! Then stalllllllllllllllllllll and it didn't move. For all of 2020 I was stuck at 185. 

Then suddenly January 2021comes and BLOOP 177. 

Hahaha!! 

I have now lost 183 pounds. I weigh 177pounds. 

I LOST MORE THAN I WEIGH!! I DID THAT!! AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!


AHHHHHHHHHHHHH the excitement is too much. Honestly. 

Anywhoodles, here are my comparisons. Yes I look like a different person. But if you go look at all of my posts you'll see someone says that every time. I can't help that my fat face was a mask. *shrug* [comparison pictures](http://imgur.com/a/7qlOtdK)

keto,How does Kimchi affect you?,"I started eating Kimchi during lunches at work because I heard of the benefits of the probiotics for gut health.  Seeing that before I didnt consume anything with probiotics purposefully I thought it was a good move.  I'm IF 18:6 most days, 36hr fasts twice a month, no cheat days, but consume a cocktail on Saturday nights.  I feel that Kimchi helps me with any carb or snack cravings at work.  However, it does cause quite a bit of GI discomfort with a laxative effect every time.  


At first I thought it was my body adjusting to it.  Then I thought maybe I got a bad batch.  I'm on my 5th or 6th container of it now and it still gives me this issues.  Personally, I don't mind it.  Unless it's a cause for health concern.  I think of it more or less of the kimchi cleaning me out.  But I do wonder if I should stop eating it all together.  

So, how does it affect you?  Should I be concerned?"

keto,"Galley kitchen with dorm fridge, tiny stove, pandemic... Any diet plan doable?","Hello everyone,

I did atkins when it was relatively new, and it worked pretty well for me.  But my life is considerably different now, and I think the diet has come a ways since then.

My problem is that I'm currently enjoying what would ordinarily be a ""mid life crisis"" and I sold my home a couple years back and now live on a sailboat.  Sailboats are not known for spacious kitchens with lots of storage space.

What I have at the moment is a dorm fridge (my ice box compressor exploded and those bastards are stupid expensive to replace).  That means I have about 1.7cu ft. of refrigerator space, and a ""freezer"" the size of a dictionary.  Additionally, while I have a stove, it runs off CNG which is kinda hard to come by in my city.  I \*can\* refill it, but it's an all-day event.  To add to the challenge, I'm a high-risk person in a pandemic, and I try not to go to the grocery store terribly often.

&amp;#x200B;

All of that is to say that I've been eating like crap since the pandemic started. (and not that healthily before that)

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm reaching out to you fine folks to see if anyone has any experience doing low or very low carb while having almost no freezer space, very little fridge space, and very little ability to bake.  I know the keyphrase for most keto diets is ""fresh produce"" or something like that.  But buying lots of fresh produce means throwing out lots of rotten produce not long thereafter.

My second question follows that up to clairify, are the high amounts of polyunsaturated fat in Pistachios harmful in general or just fine when balanced with saturated animal fats?"

So started getting strict again but this time I'm doing Nutritional and it's soooo slow going.   I've also noticed I don't have the same energy and mental clarity.   Anyone have experience with this switch?  thank you in advance"
keto,"The ""woosh"" feels good","Been level and even went up .4 lbs over the last week then dropped 2.5 lbs in the last two days.  Feels good.

Don't lose hope if you stall for a few days or a week. It's normal and it'll right itself as long as you're sticking to the plan."
keto,NSV AND scale victory in the same day!!!,"So I’ve been keto for 5 weeks tomorrow. I’ve been pretty good with only a few slip ups when out with friends and having a few drinks. All in all, I’ve stuck to it and have no plans of straying.

I’ve always wanted a pair of Lululemon leggings but couldn’t justify the price, especially when I didn’t feel good about how I looked in leggings. But the other day, I decided I would order a pair in a smaller size as motivation to keep going and a reward when I slipped them on finally. Well they got here today and guess what... they fit!!!! And they fit well. I may actually return them and get another size smaller. 🤯 at 5 weeks I’ve lost 18 lbs and didn’t realize just how much 20lbs would change my body. 

The other day I posted about being “squishy” and was told that a whoosh might be coming soon. Well to my happiness, I woke up to a 4.4 lb weight loss since yesterday! And to top it off, it’s that time of the month! It feels so motivating and exciting. I’m seriously pumped and can’t wait to see my 90 results"
keto,"Covid Crunch, please Help!","  I llive in Cali and there are still harsh lockdowns. This has crippled an amazing keto regimine. So I feel like I am staring over. I can't cardio without a gym as I've ruptured three discs in my back and need elliptical. We are opening back up and a reset has been hell, I keto for several reasons, inflammation is a big one.

I am Male, 30's, 6'3,  210-220lbs, shredding yes, most importantly muscle gains while on keto
I hit the gym 4-5 times a week. With 30 minute cardio intervals each am that are super aggressive. In other words I am dragging butt all day with glucose levels @ nill and cardio and strength training daily. 

What is a good keto calculator for types like me? I feel 20 net is not enough as I can be a raging a hole to my family at night and barley make it through cardio, and strength T. is after that. Not to mention I have found my self waking up with about 4-5 Avocado shells laying around me in the morning and having stuffed my self on sausages. 

Questions: 

Is a greater net carb needed for this type of regimine.

How do I pacify my 'hangry' so I'm not a jerk with a harder weightlifting and workout regimen?


P.S. I was so tired at Costco last night I did not have the energy to get out of the chocolate isle fast enough, no, not keto chocolate, the BAD KIND; true story. (I did make it out w/o compromise but I literally did not have the energy to get out of there quick enough)"
keto,I don't understand why I'm not losing weight,"Today I ate two chicken leg quarters. Yesterday I had a hamburger bowl with 1/2lb of beef, jalapenos,lettuce,pickles and a bit of ranch dressing.

Over the last month I've been eating only one big meal a day.

My weight is stable at 280lbs. I'm in ketosis.

I've had no cheat meals. I don't understand why the scale won't move."
keto,Do not forget to thank yourself!,"In commiting to a new way of looking at nutrition in relation to our own wellbeing, never forget to truly thank yourself for the hard work you have accomplished! We have made the decision to be more mindful of how we nourish our bodies and part of that mindfulness is the awareness of the real  challenge of making changes in our lives. 

No matter how far you are in your journey, remember this is your journey and it is extremely personal. No one is better than another since it is about living your own best life. Nobody is perfect everyday of their life, so don't ever beat yourself up, only be mindful of it and turn your hurdles into learning opportunities. Once you've gained consistency, use those milestones to motivate yourself to stay the course! 

Habits only form through consistency and any move forward will help gain momentum. Reward that momentum and mindset with really thanking yourself. Personally this thankfulness has helped me love myself more, has made me more proud of myself, and if making a life change such as this is about bettering my life, I am doing something loving for my body and in turn, for my mind and soul.

Great job everyone and keep it up! Always love yourself and keep your eyes forward towards your goals. There is no better feeling than the amount of control you feel over doing something truly good for yourself.

Thank you all for the love and support I see on this sub, we are all in this together!!"
keto,I lost all the weight I gained on Prednisone in 7 months,"Keto was the only diet that I could manage where I actually enjoyed the things I ate, and where I got creative with new ways to have chicken, steak, etc!

For a little background, I suffer from Ulcerative Colitis, and for nearly 3.5 years, I was on Prednisone, which is a synthetic steroid meant to help stop inflammation. Prednisone is not meant to be taken long term and has serious side effects. The worst being increased appetite, bloating, and water retention. I ended up gaining 60 lbs. I was on it for so long because no medication out there would put me in remission, until Entyvio came along. The second I got off Prednisone, I swore to lose all the prednisone weight, and then some.

I’m 6’3 in my mid 20s

[CW: 164 lbs (74 kg) 1/4/21](https://i.imgur.com/NngOCzm.jpg)

I've been able to maintain my weight despite not being on strict keto and enjoying cheat days here and there. Next step is building back muscle . So this post is especially for anyone who has suffered from having to be on that god awful steroid long term. It is possible to get rid of it!"
keto,Air Fryer for Keto,"I want to start using my air fryer to cook proteins for meals. Does anyone have favorite quick keto-friendly recipes? Or ideas of kinds of meat or fish to try?

So far I've only done burgers and those small bacon wrapped beef filets. I'm interested in learning how to do chicken, fish and other kinds or cuts of meat, but not sure where to start."
keto,"Thanks for the stories, they keep me going!","Listening to everyone's stories, even the ones that aren't so successful, are such an inspiration to me to keep going, and to keep trying my best. I've tried and failed with keto several times but now I'm finally on track. I started following keto around NovemberLast year. At first I was very skeptical of it, but when I looked into it I figured that I'd give it a try.

At my heaviest around October or November last year I was almost 300 lb. 20 years old, 5 ft 5 in and nearly 300 lb. 

Again with dieting on and off pretty much up until recently, I didn't really lose a lot of weight at first. There were plenty of times where I gained more weight also. Even with exercise every once in awhile. Along with a family history of horrible mental health issues, diabetes, and general obesity, I knew that I had to do something about my health.

So I'm actually immensely happy to say for about the past 3 weeks I've been doing solid keto, and I've dropped almost 7 lb. That is the most I've ever dropped in that short amount of time. Now I'm still almost 300 lb, but I am finally down to about 260. I am genuinely aiming to try to get down to about 200 by the end of this year."
keto,"Question for the ""Success Stories""","How often (and to what extent) to you allow yourself cheat meals/days?  Or do you not at all?  My initial thought was that I would be strict until I reach my goal.  At that point I would allow myself a cheat meal every now and again.  Does that not really work with keto because of how long it takes to get back into ketosis?

keto,Beware of Oxalates,"Hello All

TLDR:

IF you are eating spinach, break it, boil it and discard the water, otherwise you get very little nutrients from it and risk kidney stones.

&amp;#x200B;

I started Eating Keto some time ago now, I Have Asperger's syndrome and that means I get special interest fixations, which leads me to learn as much as I can about those topics.

Spinach Was a particular interest of mine, because I also love chickens, and I was planning on using spinach to feed them (I also used to love spinach).

So I stumbled upon the fact that spinach contains high levels of oxalates, which binds to calcium (hence the gritty feeling in the mouth after eating raw spinach), which in turn nullifies the bioavailability of that mineral, moreover, oxalate stones have been found to be a large cause of kidney stones.

This does not mean that spinach is a no no food, rather that it has to be treated before eating, 

A popular technique is to smash the leaves a bit to break the outer membrane, and then boil the spinach, it releases some nutrients and most oxalates into the water that should then be discarded.

Other options of cooking, like grilling do not allow the oxalates to be discarded."
keto,My keto journey,"I had my first keto journey, or let's call it my first keto trial in 2018. I did it for a few months and it worked for me, but I stopped on a summer holiday and was not strong enough to start it all over again.

Then in 2019 I decided to give it another go and this time I did it for 8-9 months with good results. My start weight was 80 kg, I lost 8-9 kg which does not seem much but it was everything to me. I felt great, both physically and mentally, was proud of myself, had a lot of energy. I was OK with my food, although sometimes I had a slice of cake or french fries, but was always able to continue as if nothing happened.But one day I just felt I have had enough. That day was a breaking point to me. I remember I was sitting in my car, driving home from a business meeting where we had a work lunch and everyone had sandwiches except me. I had salad with some grilled chicken. In the car I felt I have to stop and buy me some chocolate. And I stopped at the third filling station and bought me some chocolate... and a cake, and I ate them with shaky hands in the car in a span of a few seconds. As I said, I had some cheat meals before, but this time it was different. I cannot explain but I felt I won't be able to stop. I went home and started googling why keto is not a good diet. How restrictive it is and how it can cause eating disorders. And I believed all that shit.This is what I have been feeding to myself for a whole year. In the meantime I kept telling myself ""keto works until you do it - but it is causing a lot of harm when you stop"". And believing my own lie I kept on eating carbs justifying my theory, that keto is causing eating disorders 'cos see, I am now eating carbs all day long!Needless to say, I gained all the weight back plus some more. Today I am 83 kilo (and 162 cm).

I consulted an IE dietitian who told me not to weigh myself anymore. Not to restrict myself. She said I am an emotional eater and we should work on that, but I have to accept my body as it is. And I cannot talk about diet anymore, I cannot think about losing weight anymore, that this diet culture is horrible, blablabla (look up intuitive eating post on social media, you will see all that stuff). I am a critical thinker and have been asking questions. When someone is a carb-addict, and have insulin resistance, how is it not a horrible thing to tell her she can eat all the carbs she wants? As if we were OK to tell an alcoholic to drink whenever she feels like. How can I fix my relationship with food when I am at my highest weight and none of my clothes fit? When I hate my current body? When I keep thinking about the good old keto days when I loved my slimming body and I loved myself for taking it seriously. How is it a bad thing to keep wanting to be better, to be healthier, to work out more? I do not do this for other people, I do it for myself. After my questions and after I told her I do want to get slimmer, I want to feel happy about my body, she told me she was not going to work with me as she ditched this diet mentality. OK then, no problem - girl you just made me realize what I really want and what I really should start doing again.

Keto did not cause any of my eating disorders - I had them even before keto. I love carbs and I am an emotional eater but I can work on it. I got fat BEFORE keto from eating all those carbs. I just used that one huge slip of mine in the car as an excuse to be able to eat carbs again. I gave in and threw everything I achieved away, just to have that carb-high. And I could not stop for months. Look at me know, I am fatter and unhappier than ever. Meanwhile the solution was in front of me but I pretended I cannot see it. I was scared to admit that keto is the way for me, because the desire to eat carbs was stronger.

Now the desire to be happy and healthy and slimmer is again is stronger. It was my 46th birthday last week. I let myself enjoy some food (yes, carbs too) and I am starting my 3rd keto journey on Monday. This time I have a lot of good and bad experiences behind me and I learnt so much about how I can f\*ck something up. I am still not sure if I will eat keto forever, but I know if I ever want to stop, I will have to eat low carb forever to maintain my weight. And that intuitive eating, and the movement it has become (because I still believe some of the principals are actually great) is extremely dangerous for people like me. For people who are looking for excuses to stop something good, just because they got weak.

There is nothing wrong to have some restrictions if you know they work for you. Nothing wrong with wanting to work on yourself. And nothing wrong if you have a slip - you just need to stand up and continue your journey.

Good luck, everyone!"
keto,Are these low carb tortilla really 35 calories??,"I love these tortillas! They are the labanderita low carb ""snack size"" 

They are fluffy, pretty dense, and taste pretty good. Considering they are only 35 calories for a snack size (equivalent to soft taco size) I'd rather eat two of these at 35 each than one mission low carb one which is around 70 calories. They hold fold better due to the size. 

What I have concern is its a pretty dense item and almost like a pita bread. So I'm skeptical if the listed ingredients and calories actually add up.

Anyone else use these???"
keto,Learning to look for NSV instead of obsessing over numbers,"I got back into lazy keto at the start of September after about a year's hiatus because of pregnancy. Initially I started the diet for weight loss, but the added bonus of helping my migraines made me a die hard fan of the lifestyle. In January I started hardcore keto after some backtracking over the holidays.

I have recently found myself obsessing over the number on the scale, stressing about religiously tracking every little thing I eat or do, and trying to maximize my caloric deficit. About a week ago I hit my first plateau and it really bummed me out, especially after how easily I dropped weight my first time around on keto, and the fact that I've started working out regularly.

Instead of just giving up, or freaking out, I decided to follow the advice I've seen on here. I will not be stepping on the scale daily. I also tend to do better if I track a little to just get a general idea of how I'm doing, but following what my body tells me I need.

 I will be weighing myself tomorrow for the first time in a week. In the meantime, I have been feeling better and have a suspicion my plateau has ended. So I decided to try on my favorite pants from college that I haven't been able to fit into. I assumed I might be able to get them on, but not button them. To my utter surprise, not only did they button, but they are just as comfy as I remember, and I will be wearing them today!

keto,Restaurant supply stores are great if you have the freezer space.,"If you have the space for it you can really save some money on meat through your local restaurant supplier.

GFS is what I use in my area, but i picked up a 15 lb case of sheeted bacon for $45, and 40lb case of boneless skinless chicken thighs for $35.

The bacon is fantastic cause you can put the whole case in the freezer and pull out a sheet at a time and put right into the oven. Though i can occasionally get bacon this cheap, its never certian. 

The chicken is just great price wise. In my area i never see boneless skinless thighs for less than $2/lb, so this is over 50% off. What i do with them is marinate them in ziploc freezer bags, roll them up, and freeze. This way I can pull a bag out of the freezer and they can thaw and marinate and be ready to cook in a day or two.

Though not the cheapest by weight, i also like the 1/4 lb burgers that are frozen. The cost for those are typically $3 lb which is more expensive and burger on sale, but the convenience and pre-portioning is nice."
keto,"SV, My BMI is Overweight","The last time my BMI was normal was college. I can't believe I'm actually that cliche. Since College for the most part I would hover between 235-245.

Finally in my 30s, this week, I've gotten down to 218. (at 221 and 6' my BMI finally moves from the obese to the overweight category.)

I'm not ""obese"" anymore. I know, I know, that BMI is a flawed system and you shouldn't based you health on it, but it is still nice that one less mode of human categorization would call me obese.

I also know my body because I've been down to 173 as an adult. BMI is not totally off base when it comes to me and my normal muscle mass to fat ratio.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Next stop, Onederland."
keto,Carnivore to keto,"About three weeks ago I transitioned from carnivore (eggs and beef only) to keto (adding in cauliflower and bell peppers) and while drastically reducing calories have gained 4lbs. Is this due to water retention from the carbs? I am just confused because I’m eating less calories, exercising more and somehow gaining weight. I know I’m not consuming that many carbs but can fiber cause water retention?"
keto,Staying Keto during difficult times,"I’ve been keto for about 2 weeks now. My goal is migraine relief and any weight loss is secondary.

I’ve been doing okay, falling into a pattern, I have some recipes I keep going back to because they’re easy and delicious. 

I tried IF in the past and it causes huge issues with my migraines so I am trying to eat regularly within the Keto parameters.

Unfortunately, Tuesday night into yesterday morning was a tough one for me. One of the horses I work with developed some issues and had to be put to sleep. It was a long, difficult night and a very painful experience for him. I stayed with him to the end. I didn’t end up eating for about 24 hours. After the burial yesterday, I found it really difficult to think about my diet and find joy in any of the acceptable foods. I ended up getting a burrito bowl, which put me way over my goals but it was the only thing I had any appetite for.

Obviously, it made me feel even sicker in the end. I’ve been in a depressed state, struggling not to break down at any given time. I can’t focus on my diet, I can’t even think about going out of my way to hit my targets. I did make a keto breakfast this morning but had no appetite for it and only picked at it.

In the past, when I’ve been so sad and can’t eat much, I’ve gotten by on toast and soup. Obviously that’s not really an option now if I want to keep with keto.

Any suggestions for ways I can fight my instinct to destroy the clean habits I’ve been working towards?"

My only splurge was 3 diet cokes with a lemon wedge.  I haven't had any soda since I started, only coffee, tea and bone broth.

Intermittent watery diarrhea last night and this morning, could it be the coke?"

keto,QUEST bars: different size bars with different taste inconsistencies.,"Quest Bars Different Sizes store bought

Anyone who likes quest protein bars, have you also noticed a difference in taste and size of the bars when you purchase a full 12 batch vs the smaller boxes?? The 4pk or 8pk bars seem thicker but less wide, and they usually taste kind of off. The individuals or ones from a 12pk are wider but more flat and they usually taste better and have an overall better texture. Anyone else know about this? I’m thinking of just purchasing the larger 12pks because the bars seem to have better quality and different taste.

For example the cookies and cream bars from a 12pk or from a gas station had more flavor and more white chocolate chips, but all the bars from the 4pk were seemingly thicker, slightly smaller looking, and they had almost no chocolate chips but had same macros! Taste also seemed off. Same with the birthday cake bars, the ones from 12pk or gas station were wider and had better all around taste. Store bought in the 4pk box they were thicker and just a little bit different texture. Still tasted good but I prefer the 12pack bars more"

But is there a per hour limit or a time to process a certain amount of carbs? I've found previously that eating 30-40g spread out over a day won't have an impact even over weeks. But eating 30-40g in one meal for a few days does seem to knock me out. 

Does anyone know what the hourly limit/time to process carbs is?"

keto,"Keto on and off since 2017. This time, I will.","Hi,

I had started keto on Oct 2017 when my friend spoke about it. I had been struggling with weight since 2015 and I became really heavy around 2017 July. So heavy, that I had trouble breathing. This was alarming because I was diagnosed with asthma in childhood.

It was very difficult to convince my parents to be onboard with it since they believe strongly in eating lots of fruits and since I am an Indian, our staple is rice. My mom would make these delicious curries that go amazing with rice, it was so hard to resist but the results made it totally worth it.

I had lost around 27lbs during the first time I did keto in about 4 months and I looked so good. I still had not reached my goal weight and there were some more lbs to lose, but damn I couldnt believe my jawline was that good. 

Unfortunately, by 2018 I gained back all the weight. I stress eat a lot. There were times I would eat chips, ice cream, soda and what not. I did keto a couple of times in between but I could never go beyond a month. 

This time, around 27th Dec, I had decided to do keto again. I felt something was different this time. I had more time to focus on me this time. So, I continued it till 7th Jan and I had lost around 4 lbs and then I fell off the wagon and gained all the weight back in 2 days. This time my body responded differently, I started getting breathing troubles. I remember sitting on the staircase, trying to catch a breath, it was because of overeating. I couldn't believe what I had done to my self and how self damaging I was. I was disappointed.

Starting 8th Jan, I started keto again and I have been in keto since. I lost around 13 lbs and I have to lose 24lbs. I hope I achieve this goal this time. Today after a long time, I did yoga and I want to workout in the evening too. I have been doing intermittent fasting too since 3 weeks. This time it feels different. This time I want those abs, I want those jeans that fit me once, to fit again. This time I want to go shirtless in the beach and not be embarrassed about my body. 

This time I will.

With Love,
Cute keto guy"

keto,Plateau everytime I do low carb,"Hi all,

Long story as short as I can make it: when I was 19 I did Atkins and lost a pound a day, in which over 6 months I lost 50 lbs. I plateaued and never was able to fix it. I maintained the weight for 5 years until I met my husband.

Over the course of 10 years I flip flopped trying to do keto/atkins again. It would always be the same: I'd lose some water weight, and then I'd plateau for the rest of the month.

I'm on keto for 6 weeks now. Lost 4 lbs. Nothing else. Stats are: 29 F, 1600 cals, 120 Fat, 100 protein, 30-20 carbs. Current weight is 236 lbs. 

Thanks in advance for any help."

keto,Is this a more worrisome version of the Keto Itch??,"Hello everyone!

First post in this group, but I've enjoyed reading all the posts here and found so many helpful tips that have been useful on my own keto journey.  So thank you!! 😍I'm 16 weeks in and doing well.

About 5-6 weeks ago, I started to have horrible itching all over my body, especially on my back, my thighs, my abdomen, and my arms. I've read here about the Keto Itch. I've been trying to manage with moisturizers, scrubs at the spa, an antihistamine 1-2 times a day but it's very hard and I feel like it's driving me crazy. I also have been taking magnesium, potassium, and now B complex vitamin supplements in case that's the issue.

However, about a week ago, I now feels somewhat numb over my abdomen and parts of my thighs. When I touch those areas, I can tell I'm touching but doesn't quite feel normal. Thankfully, the itching in those areas has subsided as a result. But is this a more worrisome sign? I do not have diabetes, maybe a little borderline glucose intolerance, but this isn't a neuropathy. Should I have labs done to look any sort of deficiency? Will the feeling ever come back? Or should I just be happy to have fewer areas that I need to scratch?

Thanks in advance for all of your expertise and advice, S"

keto,"Period, bloating, in pain and not hungry, why am I gaining?","So I've been doing really good back on keto and contrary to many posts I've read, keto fixed my irregular periods(pcos). 
Now I just started my cycle and am extra bloated, all my joins and muscles hurt, have a massive heache but the worst part is I literally seemed to have gained 2 pounds since this morning! 

I'm in so much pain, and am not hungry nor thirsty so I havet eaten, how?! 

Can anyone else relate? What were your ""old wives tales"" remedies for the pain or for keto?"
keto,New to Keto,"Hey guys I'm new here to reddit and to the keto lifestyle and I just want to be where I could ask questions and receive answers from people familiar with it. I became interested in keto when I had a boss at work  who lost 50lbs in 5 months, he said he was eating keto and he did it doing NO excercise but also did intermittent fasting. My question as I start this is it's been a week now and I've been eating mainly a meat source and cup or 2 full of veggies, how much fat do I really need to eat? I'm 5'10 and 280, I feel like I shouldn't eat much fat, and what happens if I end up eating more protein than fat daily? Would that be a sustainable way to eat and have energy? I've been doing my study up on YouTube and websites, any suggestions or comment would be appreciated. Thank you."
keto,I’m tired of pretending that chronic depression and sugar consumption don’t go hand in hand.,"I came here because most of us have given up sugar, some indefinitely, and some for only a certain period of time, but I have no doubt in my mind that many of you have gone through drastic changes in your mental health, physical health, and overall happiness since you made the switch. What do you remember about your previous self, and how different is your life now?

[edit: obviously, sugar is not the only cause of depression]"
keto,Alternative for flour?,"Hey all. I really want to make cheese steak dumplings. Seems easy enough but I need a substitute for flour. Does anyone know what substitute taste most similar? Almond flour doesn't necessarily sound good, but I've never tried it."
keto,Alcohol on Keto,"Not exactly science, but close enough 
I just wanted to point out to anyone starting keto to please be careful when drinking alcohol.
When I first started keto I would drink straight vodka mixed with something sugar free and boy oh boy, did I learn very quickly that my tolerance was basically zero. I was TRASHED after two or three drinks. I thought they tasted like juice but friends said it tasted like straight vodka lol. 
Back to science....
The body’s tolerance level will go down with less carbs and I wasn’t aware. Just wanted to put that out there."
keto,Keto Anxiety,"Did anyone else have a lot of anxiety on the first week? I’m on day 2 and I’m having anxiety that I haven’t had all week, the only caffeine I’m getting is from tea which I started drinking this week and it hasn’t bothered me this week until today, anyway to make it go away?"
keto,The “woosh” is a real thing!,"Hi all.
I just wanted to share something encouraging, if you’re currently in the middle of a weight loss stall.  So I didn’t have a ton of weight to lose, but after kids the pounds just stubbornly stuck around and I never felt good about carrying around the extra weight.  
I’m 5’2.  Starting weight 145 current weight is 129.  
I hit 137 about two months into keto and just stayed there, for another two months.  It was very frustrating despite following keto closely, and I came to the conclusion that I will just always hover around that weight.  Well, a few weeks ago the remaining pounds finally dropped off, without changing anything.  Must be the ‘woosh’ everyone talks about!
So if you’re stuck in a stall, I know it can feel discouraging.  But don’t give up just yet, keep going!!"
keto,Help! 2nd time so much harder,Hi fellow Ketoers! I need some advice/ support- 3 years ago I was living the keto life and lost 80 lbs and felt the best I’ve ever felt!! Since then I had a beautiful baby and gained back 50 lbs from eating nothing but carbs and fruit for 9 months. I am having such a hard time committing to keto this time around. I will be strict keto for 2-3 weeks and then I will fall off the wagon hard. Why can’t I commit this time!? And the longest stretch I’ve made was 2 months and barely lost any weight besides water weight. Yes I watch my macros and calories etc- but I can’t stop falling off the wagon! Please help with any advice or words of encouragement! I just want to feel the way I did when I was fully committed to my keto life! Thanks
keto,[Question] Have you guys ever had this happen to you?,I don't know how to explain it but I'm a week and a day in. I would explain it as a sugar rush but like a fat rush after eating? Is this normal because I have no other friends doing keto to ask so I came here?

I'm doing keto and IF (18:6), doing just two meals a day (breakfast and lunch). My calorie intake is around 900 - 1,000 cal, is that amount okay? Or it could be detrimental ?

My goal is to lose weight, I'm currently at 91 kg and the goal is 70 kg.

keto,Aldi - Elevation bars; 2g net carbs,"Peanut butter fudge crisps. Tasted real good. A box of 5 were less than $5 and were smaller than a Quest bar.

For those in SoCal, I was at Aldi in Westminster."
keto,question metabolism,"Hi all, I posted yesterday about my progress and someone commented about crashing my metabolism. I eat somewhere between 1000-1400 kcal a day. I don't have any hunger feeling at all and stay under 20g carbs a day. Does this crash my metabolism (if that even is a thing) and does it have a negative effect on my weight loss?

keto,Sparkling Ice and Celsius drink ok on Keto?,"I have lived feelings about this and as someone who just started this journey a month ago I feel like I don’t have the right information even with as much research I’ve done.
I have mostly been drinking water and one cup of coffee a day and I wanted to look for more keto friendly drinks. I came across sparkling ice which has 0g Carbs, 0g Fat, 0g Sugar with only 5 Calories and Celsius is the same but with 2g Carbs and 10 Calories. sounded great to me, but then I saw that they both have Sucralose which from what I’ve read it spikes blood sugar and insulin resulting in kicking you out of ketosis.
is this keto friendly, or is this a trap?"
keto,"Is there a reliable guide for diabetics and keto? Or is this something 100% should be done with a doc (and if so, how did that look for those of you who did it this way)?","Hi all! I've been doing keto for abut 3 yrs and I love it. It's easy for me and I've lost about 30lbs (yay!) and just am maintaining. My mom has seen this and would love to see the same results but she's older (60) and has diabetes. I am just worried that if I start helping her on keto that there might be an adverse reaction because she has diabetes. She has no other conditions though but that seems major in and of itself. I've seen so many of your guy's and gal's and folk's success in using keto to manage your diabetes, I thought I would ask for experiences around here. Any bit is helpful - I realize keto isn't for everyone because of certain limitations but would love to have her achieve the same success as me. 

Her MD isn't keen on keto and is very much a ""medication is the way"" kind of guy. I trust him &amp; his opinion but I also think his opinion is colored by the fact my mom had poorly controlled diabetes for a while and he's just not convinced she can used diet and exercise alone to manage her condition (this is a fair &amp; reasoned assessment imo - please no attacks on him!) I think I can get him on board (I go to all her visits to translate now) but he's not very well informed on keto - is there anything we should know if we go the MD-directed path? 

Otherwise, I might just help her develop a more rigorous low-carb CICO-based diet instead. Just wanna make sure she's happy &amp; healthy. :) Thank you in advance!"
keto,NSV a random old lady complemented me!,"I’ve been slowly losing weight over the last 6 months or so, and have lost a total of 60lbs total. I also recently cut my hair, and it turns out I have a jawline! Today when I was walking to work I walked past this same old house I always walk past. I have never spoken to the woman that lives there, the house has kind of a tough appearance with multiple pit bulls chained in the yard etc. 

Today when I walked out the old lady that lives there came running out and stopped me. She told me I was “so good looking now!” And that she had watched me walk by her house for the past year and is just amazed with my progress. She told me she was proud of my obvious hard work and that the weight loss was one thing, but the haircut real accentuated the change. 

I’ve struggled with self image, and when I look in the mirror I still see a really fat guy. It was very nice to hear from a stranger that not only they’ve noticed the change, but fell compelled enough to tell me. For those of you that feel like you haven’t changed much even though the numbers on the scale say otherwise, trust me, people notice!"
keto,"Keto cereal comparison- Schoolyard Snacks, Magic Spoon, Highkey.","TLDR: Get Magic Spoon! Maybe Highkey if you are really strict with your carbs. Dont bother with Schoolyard Snacks. 

Well I've now tried all three of these brands and I thought I'd just review them for you all and share the pros and cons of each. (I hope this is ok to post, I dont see any rules that this would be breaking and I also dont see any recent posts that compare these three brands)

To start with, the are all pretty expensive. But here's their ranking price-wise: (comparing the largest quantity available to buy and not counting subscription prices)

1. Magic spoon is the cheapest at $1.39 per serving (3/4 cup)
2. Highkey is about $1.50 per serving (1/2 cup, but because of the shape of the cereal, it packs in more densely than the other two so I think even though a serving is a half cup vs 3/4 cup, it is pretty equivalent) 
3. Schoolyard is the most expensive at $1.87 per serving (3/4 cup)

Carb count

1. Highkey claims 0 net carbs, although I'm sure this is rounded down as there are ingredients with at least trace carbs
2. Schoolyard snack is 1 net carb 
3. Magic spoon is 3-4 net carbs (up to 5 for some of their seasonal flavors)

Their fat/protein and calorie counts are all pretty close so I'm not going to bother ranking those

Flavor

1. Magic spoon is I think hands down the best flavor. I haven't had a bad flavor yet and I've had all their evergreen flavors plus a handful of seasonal and past flavors. They dont always taste exactly like you would expect, but they taste GOOD! There is no after taste and none of the weird mouth effects that come with some fake sweeteners.
2. Highkey- so far I've had frosted and cinnamon (will be trying cocoa and fruity soon as well). These taste pretty good, they are sweet and will definitely do the trick if I am just craving that blast from the past of a good bowl of cereal, but they do have a (very minor) after taste and have the cooling effect which is a little off-putting to me. 
3. Schoolyard snacks is to cereal as La Croix is to Soda... So almost flavorless. Seriously, not worth it. I had this more than a year ago so maybe they've changed things up since then, but at the time the peanut butter and chocolate were the only flavors and they were not good. Can't speak to any of their newest flavors.

Texture

1. Magic spoon has the best cereal-like texture. (it comes as ""O's"") It does kind of collect in your gums which a lot of people can't stand. I personally dont mind that and its worth the good crunch.
2. Schoolyard Snacks I think felt a little bit card-board-y (puffed balls), but maybe that was more an effect of the lack of flavor than the texture...
3. Highkey feels stale right out of the bag (rice crispy shaped). It's kind of... chewy? Its ok but it's not great.

Other things to note:

1. Schoolyard Snacks comes in individual bags. To me this feels unnecessarily wasteful. Maybe this is useful for an on-the go snack, but I find when I'm eating keto-levels of carbs, I'm not snacking anyway...
2. Magic spoon frequently has fun new and/or seasonal flavors
3. Magic Spoon and cereal school are a good ""dry snack"" shape, Highkey is a kind of sticky rice-crispy shape so doesn't make a good dry snack.
4. They are all gluten free and grain free

In summary: For all of these I'd actually eat 2/2.5 servings to make a full meal. A single serving works as a snack or as an accompaniment to a meal. Magic Spoon is hands-down the yummiest, but it can be kind of high in carbs if you are staying strictly under 20, but if you using it as a bit of a treat or in small portions with other low-carb foods, then it tastes best, is the least expensive, and has the most variety. If you are being more strict, Highkey is still a really good option and will absolutely satisfy that craving without making the rest of your day really difficult carb-wise. Dont buy Schoolyard snacks, it tastes like cardboard, is wasteful, and is the most expensive... just not worth it.

Anyway, that's how these three brands shake down in my opinion. Feel free to share your own experiences. Or suggestions for other brands!"
keto,Picking the bread off of wings in a pinch,"Today at work the hot table was serving breaded fried chicken wings and fries with a paltry salad bar. Grateful for the food, saddened by the quality. 

I grabbed a salad of spinach and lettuce, 5 wings, and some spicy mayo. Then I picked the bread off the wings being careful to only add the chicken that had absolutely no breading on it to the salad. I put it altogether and felt quite unsatisfied lol

My question is, how bad is it to just pick the bread off as opposed to having them prepared properly? I know they’re healthy when prepped in a keto friendly way, but these were not."
keto,1 Month Complete - Shedding for the Wedding and Beyond...,"I’ve been lurking for a few weeks now, I figure now is the time to introduce myself! I love reading everyone else's stories, so here's mine:

**Background:** I’m a 25 yr old female. I was fit in high school, and graduated at a lean 175 pounds (for my 5’ 2” frame). Within 3 years I managed to gain a lot of weight and ended up at 244 pounds! Why? The obvious – poor diet. But also, I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia at 19. The debilitating pain was masked with massive binges. Not to mention, my bf (now fiancé) eats twice what I should in a day so naturally I ate to keep up with him. I managed to gain and lose from 190 to 213 to 185 to 240. Summer of 2020 I got down to 225, but gained back 10 by November of last year.

**Current Keto Journey**: January 3rd (2021), I committed to TWO months of Keto. Just a small task, something I thought was manageable. My initial thoughts were to use it as a jumpstart to my weight loss plan for my wedding in October of this year.  I’ve officially made it 4 weeks and I am thrilled at how far I’ve come. I'm also a pescatarian which makes some things difficult!

**My WHY**: The biggest hurdle in any weight-loss plan is sticking to it long term. I have found that by defining my ""why"" gives me an extra push of motivation:

* I have lost myself in the last 8 years and want to be proud of myself and my life again. I want to be active and live life to the fullest.
* I want to try for a baby at the end of this year and am SO motivated to be a healthy mom! This starts with having a baby-making body in tip-top shape!! (I do NOT want to have to be ANY heavier than I am now pregnant!)

**Benefits so far:**

* Decreased pain (from fibromyalgia)
* Increased energy.
* Increased positivity.
* Increased sense of self-worth – I feel accomplished!
* NEVER craving anything. Fiancé made 24 cookies and I didn’t even care!"
keto,Amazing Feeling 🙂,"Thank you keto redditors! Thank you so much! You really kept me going this time. I was religiously checking posts every day and it worked! Background info is I have successfully in the past happily keto-ed for periods of time. The longest of which 2 years. However, with age, it has been more and more difficult to get past first goal post of turning that ketosis corner where you no longer feel exhausted and sluggish while adjusting to burning fat for fuel. This time round, it really took me by surprise how hard it was to stick with it. I started some time in November and kept falling off the wagon 2 or 3 days in. Every time. I gave up. I got up again and started up again. I did this about 10 times between november and today. I was getting more and more disciplined with my electrolytes but I still didn't manage to get past the intense carb cravings about 3 days in. Around that time I could feel my glycogen levels drop sharply and the exhaustion coupled with the sugar withdrawal symptoms won every time. I would open the sweets cupboard (I know! We do have one of those in the house!) and I would help myself to a mini bindge. My weight started to creep up, because of course what I was doing was loading up fat during the day and then washing it down with a nice insulin bomb in the evening and even though volume wise I didn't eat much, it was very calorie dense food and the perfect storm of fat plus carbs. 

Anyway, I was really determined. I thought to myself, ok, you've read and heard so much, you know there is no other diet which works for you (at one point in a moment of desperation I even considered a low fat medium carb diet - as if that's ever worked!) so really it's just about getting past the keto adaptation bit. It's smooth(ish) sailing from there. I know because I've done it before and it has done amazing things for my body. So I persevered. I got past the fatigue, past the cravings, past the exhaustion (no keto flu this time at all because I wasn't afraid to ramp up my electrolytes this time. I had read somewhere that too much potassium can be dangerous and being the hypochondriac that I am, I was being so careful with it before that I ended up with keto-flu every time too, which didn't help). Anyway, NSV, 2 weeks in, today for the first time when I went for a walk (we live on a steep hill so most of our walks involve a serious climb) I didn't get out of breath. I didn't get exhausted at all! It was such an amazing feeling! Ketosis has clearly kicked in and I am becoming fat adapted and I'm starting to feel absolutely wonderful! So I wanted to come here and say thank you so much! I used your stories as an anchor to keep me holding onto my future, which I so need and want. Thank you!"
keto,Carb manager w/meal planning,"Does anyone have a good alternative to the carb manager app (android). 
The latest update has just made it terrible and I'm looking for alternatives. 
I really liked the meal planning feature as it showed what my planned macros were,  That's been nerfed. It's a pain to log things without the app freezing.
Any good overall alternatives would be appreciated.
Thank you"
keto,Amazing Victory I didn't even realize I was working towards,"I was getting a bit obsessed with weighing myself so stopped using a scale a while back. After a few weeks of not noticing much change I noticed my clothes fitting differently and made a comment to my partner that I felt like I was still on track losing weight and inches. She said she could tell by looking at me and added **I can even put my hands together when I hug around you.**

It was so nice to hear. Best benefit ever. Health, pounds, better skin, sure that's nice, but give me improved hugs!!!"
keto,Recipes,"Where do you all find your keto recipes? Do you guys just search online or is there a specific cookbook or something I should use? 

I feel as someone who is just starting out I would prefer a cookbook to start off with then work my way up to finding my own recipes. I know how to cook so that’s not a problem. I also looked at the Google doc at the top of the subreddit containing various keto-friendly and non-keto-friendly foods. Now, I just need to know how to put them together. Thank you in advance for your help!"
keto,What is your go-to keto sweet treat?,"I’m having huge sweet cravings, but every dessert I’ve had so far just has an off taste to me. I’m not the biggest fan of Almond flour honestly."
keto,Any tips for getting adequate protein when you’re only eating 1200 Cals per day?,"Basically the title. I’m having such a hard time getting enough protein with such a low Calorie ceiling.  I’m aiming for    at least 90 grams per day. I’m keeping net carbs under 20g and not really paying attention to the fat. 

I mainly eat eggs, avocado, and a bit of bacon.  This uses up a large portion of my daily cals and just isn’t high enough in protein, so I clearly need to make a change! 

I’m not a huge fan of lean meats but do eat them.  I hate canned tuna and cottage cheese.  Any other ideas for good sources of protein?  Someone mentioned protein powder and I’d love to know if anyone has any suggestions for brands they like.

I don’t mean to sound super picky but I just know if I’m gonna make this diet sustainable, I need to find foods I actually like that give me nutrition, otherwise it won’t last. 

Thanks!"
keto,CARBMARES,Been on strict keto (less than 15 carbs) for over a month. Loving it way easier than I thought but ive been having serious carbmares of eating fries and chugging soda or eating fried chicken. Crazy how a diet changes your brain as well blows my mind.
keto,Wanting more protein on keto,"New to keto (one month in) and a bit confused about the varying research positions on protein. I love meat and find that I've been struggling so far because I feel like I'm not having enough. I do have quite a bit of weight to lose (around 80 pounds), which I would ideally like to lose by the end of this year, so I don't want to self-sabotage. How do I know the sweet spot when it comes on to protein?"
keto,I keep hearing conflicting reports about whether 20g or 50g carbs per day is acceptable? What is the correct answer? If it depends on the person what are the variables at play?,"I’ve been doing Keto for a year now and I would like to increase my daily carb intake from 20g to 50g if I could. What factors matter? Does the fact that I’m a 6ft male that exercises, and that I’ve been doing it for a long time combined with IF  impact how much I can eat without slipping out of ketosis?"
keto,"What is your ""go to"" meal?","So, I have started Keto again this week.  To get me started I am sticking with a couple of meals this week that are low enough in carbs to get me sorted.  


If you had to choose just one meal (think, OMAD) that you had to eat for the rest of your life that would pretty much sort your nutrition out, what would it be?  Obviously, if you need to supplement or top up every now and then, you can."
keto,Egg wraps with cauliflower at Costco,Anyone tried these? I picked up a couple packs over the weekend at Costco and ate one this morning. They are super thin crepe-like things made with egg whites and cauliflower. 30 cals and no carbs. They taste fantastic. Nice for breakfast with some peanut butter or cream cheese smeared on. Good wrap for lunch too. They also had some massive parmasean Cheese wraps woth no carbs and 130 cals I haven’t tried yet.
keto,This is a minor scale victory with a NSV too!,"I've been 175-180 as long as I can remember but today I BROKE IT!!! Thanks to Keto!!! I am now 171.8.  Today is starting out to be a dang pretty good day!  Also my leggings, for the longest time they were actually kinda tight around my stomach.  Today, they definitely they aren't tight at all.  I'm not keeping track of days, it'll just bring me down.  I'm just looking at the results that's it and I'm waking up slowly with more energy.  I also quit smoking yesterday after 16 yrs of smoking and thanks to bipolar, I have to do it non conventional or make my husband's life a living hell. So I've decided to vape.

I've started at 35 mg nicotine salts and will slowly go down.  I was scared yesterday it would stall but nope it hasn't so far.  Maybe it helps that I have a job with food delivery, yesterday was pretty busy even took a couple petco orders for pet food. I've even taken hyvee orders for grocery delivery.  Another NSV I managed stress last night.  I do not want to hear anybody say stress can make them eat and eat and eat.

Let me tell you guys something, the IRS is on our butt's for what? Back taxes! But not thousands! It's over 400 dollars that's it.  Paying them 100 today and will continue 100 a month until it's paid.

Our water bill is due, it's 200 dollars and we have to pay it in 2 days. We had a leak we didn't know about.  Guess what I know I'll pay that, I KNOW I will make that.

My brother in law's wife is back in the hospital, it doesn't look good with an absence. They think COVID did this because that's what she went in for to begin with. They did surgery to remove it but she's not responding to treatment.

I have diabetes (type 2 but supplement with insulin as needed) and guess what it was this morning 98 which is completely normal! 

Guess what I wanted to do last night? I was in a Idc mood, I just wanna eat, I don't wanna cook! I got off about 4pm after work. I still got up off my butt, I cooked the keto chicken parmesan (modified it in my way where it was 2 net carbs in 9 ounces of chicken), and it was pretty good. Even my carboholic husband loved it and he HAS to have carbs. He's one of those guys he was in the military and his metabolism even at 48 is super high so if he doesn't have like tons of carbs and like 3,000 calories a day his body starts feeding off of itself.  I never knew that was possible, we checked him for everything including cancer since his dad had cancer 3 times before he died.........but everything is normal so he has to be constantly snacking on something it seems.

DO NOT let stress get in your way! Take a bath like I did! Talk to someone! Give yourself some me time like I did with movies! Nice smelling lotion is good too like I use Dr. Teal's."
keto,syrups/flavorings that aren’t nauseating?,"I purchased a few keto syrups and regular flavors from Jordan’s Skinny Syrups. However, now that I’m solidly into keto, everything tastes magnified in sweetness. 

Every morning I mix XCT and collagen peptides into my iced coffee and I enjoy throwing some heavy cream and a flavor syrup in so it doesn’t get monotonous.  I drink it with my giant handful of vitamins and other supplements. 

In the beginning it wasn’t bad, but it’s to the point now that I’m using very little and it’s so fake sweet that it makes me almost nauseated and it’s unpalatable. 

I end up throwing it away, therefore wasting the XCT and collagen that aren’t cheap. 

Has anyone found a great flavoring (syrup powder extract anything) that has decent flavor without absolutely drowning you in artificial sweetness?

Thanks guys!! You’ve all already helped me more than you know."
keto,Carb manager rounding error?,"I ran into an issue with carb manager the other day I wonder if anyone has insight into. I was adding something to the app I was eating that showed less than 1 g carb per serving on the label. I honestly can’t remember what food it was right now. 

I was eating more than one serving of it, it may have been lemon juice when I was making some lemonade. I noticed when I ramped up the serving size the carbs and cals didnt change. That led me to wonder about my beloved pickle. 

I’ve always loved Pickles and they are no sugar added sort. The catch is when I put it in carb manager it quickly ramps the carbs up. The label shows no calories and less than a gram of carbs per serving. But if I eat an entire dill, five servings per the label, it shows five carbs  

Why would the other food with the same label not jack up the carbs, but the pickles do? Which food is wrong?"
keto,What high foods are the best for clarity and cognition?,"I've been eating keto a week or so, and generally I feel good. I eat around 2000 - 2500 kcal per day, getting proteins from different kinds of meat, eggs or cottage cheese. The main source of fat for me is coconut oil. I'm still experimenting with foods, and today I've tried getting my calories from bacon. It was handy, case there is no need to cook it, but I felt huge brain fog after it. So I started thinking, if other foods might affect it to some extent. So, what are the best foods for mental clarity?"
keto,"Does Anyone Know ""The Truth"" About Low-Carb Breads?","So I'm a pretty regular eater of expensive 'Low-Carb"" bread that I have shipped from Florida. It claims to have tons of fiber and 2 net carbs per 28g. So I was consuming 2 slices a day and not thinking much of it. However, I've run into some online allegations that all these sorts of bakeries drastically under-report the amount of carbs in these products and that it's more like 8 net carbs per 28g. 

I know nutrition labels have a margin of error, but 400% seems a bit much. Like fraudulent. Does anyone have any ""real"" data about this? Thanks!"
keto,Need advice for my wife who is not seeing the results she wants,"My wife started keto Jan 4th in an effort to shake some baby weight that she wasn't able to get rid of with regular calorie restriction and exercise.

Her routine/stats are as follows:

\- 16/8 intermittent fasting

\- 1000-1100 calories per day. She weighs and tracks everything

\- Exercises daily burning 200-350 calories per day (Peloton biking and bootcamps)

\- Has never cheated and has been in ketosis consistently (we check with a Keto Mojo meter)

\- She gets around 90g protein daily. The Keto Calculator says 73g is what she needs. 

I see a change in her body and she's gotten a ""girl, you lost weight!"" from a co-worker but the number on the scale is not moving and that really affects her mentally, especially when it goes back up like today. I've been encouraging her to forget about the number and look at the results but it's at the point where even I'm wondering how the hell the number could go up?!

So a few questions: Is she eating too few calories and homeostasis is causing her body to hold onto the weigh? It doesn't seem like she dropped any water weight, why? is it too early to change things up? \*edit the Keto Calculator says she is at a 32% caloric deficit... is that not too high?

Any advice would be helpful! She's been working so hard to make this work for her and she's very discouraged. It's working like magic for me, I'm down 17lbs since jan.1.

keto,I’m hungry and hitting a plateau,"Hey folks! I started keto May 26, 2020 (was off and on October 2020-December 2020) and since then I’ve lost about 46 pounds. But now I feel like my weight loss has stalled, I’m having a lot of fluctuations, plus I’m hungry a lot. Any advice on what I can eat that’s low carb, low cal, but filling? I’m a 5’4” 29 year old female weighing 170 and my goals are 1448 calories, 93 grams of protein (I usually go over), 20 net carbs, and 111 grams of fat (I’m usually under).  

Thanks!"
keto,Fat Orgasms?,"Okay so I had great results with keto a while back and managed to lose around 30lbs over about 9 months 205-&gt;175, M 5'10. I definitely could've lost more doing clean keto but it was my first real diet and it was working as intended. So there was this moment about 8ish months in where I experienced my first true mouth orgasm. Never experienced something like it before. Some delicious foods before keto were ""yeah this is pretty tasty man"" but that fat cap off the ribeye literally made my eyes roll into the back of my head for a hot second. It was kinda startling but the way the fat kinda just melted onto the tongue....ooph. So I'm starting keto and trying to reach that point again (I'm assuming I finally reached full adaptation?) and was wondering if that was normal and if anyone has experienced anything similar? Kinda feels like I'm chasing a high but food had literally never tasted so good before even after an extended fast.

Edit: okay I should clarify that I was being a bit hyperbolic and it was not sexual"
keto,Week 5: frustrated!,"Today is my second day of week 5. My weight isn’t moving at all. I’ve been stuck at the exact same number for the last two weeks. Most days I eat 10 net carbs and around 1k calories. Don’t exercise. Drink 48 ounces of water. It’s so demotivating and frustrating to not see the number move :( 

SW: 172
CW: 164 (I hit this in week 3 on 1/19)
GW: 130"
keto,Blood pressure experience (genetic variety),"Hi folks,

I recently found out I have high blood pressure, it runs in my family. I'm in good shape weight and fitness wise. 

I'm taking on the Keto life to try and influence it and get it under control. I'm entering week two and just offloaded that water weight! 

My question is, would anyone here care to share timelines around blood pressure drops from their personal experience?

My second question, anyone have any issues with it being spiked? For example, I had a bottle of wine Sat night and found it elevated Sunday evening. Could be adaptation to new lifestyle, or a reaction to alcohol? 

Thanks very much everyone 🤙"
keto,No More Groundhog Day,"Pre-keto everyday was exactly the same.  Come to consciousness, slowly drag my swollen, aching body out of the bed.  Stand hunched over the night table in excruciating pain and seeing stars as I struggled against the pain in my back to stand up straight. Take a few shuffling steps towards the rest room and curse my life for being so painful.  It would take over an hour for the inflammation in the herniated discs in my back to adjust to my now vertical position.  The plantar fasciitis in my feet never stopped hurting all day long.  I'd start shoveling the carbs into my face just as soon as I could, and I wouldn't stop until minutes before I passed out to repeat the cycle all over again.  And I used to tell myself carbs made me happy.  HA!  All of that was completely gone after 2 months of keto.  No more groundhog day."
keto,NSV,Just wanted to share a small NSV I discovered last night!  Before Christmas I had gone shopping for some new clothes for the holidays.  Of coarse with COVID your not allowed to try on in store so I brought it all home.  The pants I  chose I couldn't even pull up all the way.  I put them back in the bad to be returned and plum forgot about them until last night when I stumbled acrost said bag.  Worried the return period had ended I decided to try on again.  Guess what im wearing to work today?!
keto,Keto breda with macadamia nuts flour,How does that sound ? Very low omega 6 pufa so low risks of oxidation :) ? Also very very low carb since macadamias has like 5 grams of total carbs per 100 g ! So a classic keto bread recipe using these nuts should be great right ?
keto,Lost 10kg on keto and gained it back because the hazards hidden in it for ths long run. Any further information will be helpful,"Hello, i started the keto diet 6 months ago and lost 10kg in 3.5 months and when i got to my goal weight i started to kick out of ketosis by  slowly adding carbs to my diet and quit tracking my daily calories on myfitnesspal and additionally, stopped doing intermittent fasting for 24/20 hours as i used to. Today, 2.5 months later, i gained the 10kg i lost and now i want to chnage a directio.
At the time that i quit the keto diet for some reason j quite exercising but it is important to mention that o quit smoking too, i smoked for 3 years and thats what probably helped my weight gain.

The main reason i quit the keto is because i read that the keto diet is something you should to for a short period of time. Can someone who maybe knows more than i, can detailed me a bit more if the keto diet is rising the potential of having cardiovescular issues in the futute?

Thank you guys"

keto,Keto + Training,"Hello all,

I'm 2 weeks into keto and already seeing all the great  benefits - no hunger/cravings, weight loss, stable energy levels etc...

The only issue i have is the significant impact on performance when i work out (lifted weights seriously for the past 12 years or so).

I'm well aware that fat adaptation takes around 3 months, and i'll definitely be sticking to the keto diet to see it through. But my question is; 

Am i okay to start a tkd approach now i.e - having 25-30g fast acting carbs (dextrose) pre workout or will this delay the fat adaptation phase, and i'd be better off waiting until fully fat adapted?

Would be great to hear back off someone who has been in a similar situation!

Thanks"

keto,My why: perimenopause,"F46/ SW 176 (1/1/21) / CW169/ GW145

I was starting to get perimenopause symptoms of insomnia and hot flashes in November '20. And they were so uncomfortable that I was determined to do everything possible to learn how to manage this body better. Of course the first thing to address is inflammation from what I'm consuming. I immediately cut out alcohol and weed that I'd been using for ""Coping '2020"", and getting to sleep naturally. Then I started to taper down on sugar and carbs to the goal of starting keto 1/1, addressing the 30 extra pounds of discomfort. 

Here's the magical thing that is happening mentally. While my body is changing, so is my mind. I started this knowing that as I approach the second half of life, this change in diet will be a rest of my life habit. And I've somehow felt 100% certain of my success and equally comfortable and at ease with the effort that takes. My mind has never felt so absolute about *anything*. I'm daily shocked by this. It is so unlike me. 

I'm writing this now because even though it's been a particularly savage hormone swing day, the goal of lessening the symptoms with diet change has been so far sooooooo good. It started out being 2 weeks, and is this month, 2 days. 

It may be that my surprisingly positive attitude is the very simple decision that I made to support, rather than fight, my own body. I'm going to love and nurture myself to feel good. (Here's a fun tip: anything that you do motivated by hate, you can flip to be motivated by love! Example: I'm doing this because I love my body, not because I hate constantly fighting the same 30 lbs. While the latter is certainly true, it's not nearly as motivating as the equally true former.) I know that the future trajectory is slowed metabolism and probable weight gain. But I'll do all that I can for myself to make sure that isn't a slow decent to death by inaction. I don't say this very often, but I'm really proud of myself!"

Eating low carb paleo- no dairy. Lots of lean meats and veggies. Not a lot of extra fat. My calorie goal is 1600, I eat 1200-1400 and trust my body to make up the rest in my own fat. But what is going on?"
keto,"3 weeks in, 11 pounds down. No booze in 3 weeks.","I have been doing a paleo-ish diet for a few years and am no stranger to eating big portions of meat at every meal. But my big problems were weekends; beer and takeaways (Chinese and pizzas), for 4 or 5 years I've been putting weight on. I got to 115kg a few years ago, which is about 250ish pounds. I'm 5'11"" and reasonably broad/muscley naturally, but this was waaaay too much weight to be carrying. I got down to 105kg in the first lockdown (in the UK) with diet and exercise, but haven't managed to get below that. So though I'd try keto. 

I started keto on January 11th (made the decision to get all the Christmas food and booze gone from the house first). At first I didn't feel that much different and needed constant reassurances that if I stayed under 20g carbs a day, I would be in ketosis. I started getting frustrated reading stories about how people lost so much weight so quickly. But I stuck with it. 65% calories from fat, 35% calories from protein, under 20g carbs a day and I haven't had a drink since 7th January. 

Anyway, I weighed myself this weekend and was 100 kg on the button (220 pounds) meaning I have lost 11 pounds since I started 3 weeks ago. I have noticeably lost fat from my belly, love handles and face. This has given me the willpower to carry on."
keto,MyNetDiary Question.,"Hello all- I am moving from using CarbManager to MyNetDiary for tracking my intake and macros. This is a super specific question for iOS users with Apple Watch/Apple health: is there anyway I can get MyNetDiary to import my total “Move” calories I burn, as opposed to just my explicit exercise calories? CarbManager would subtract what I burned on the daily, which is what I want . I walk a lot, but I don’t turn it into a “Workout” explicitly on my Apple Watch. This results in 200-400 calories a day that MyNetDiary just doesn’t log and it’s upsetting. 


More context: I’m making the app move since I’ve been on keto for a year and my cholesterol is sky high. I’ve had very satisfactory weight loss over the past year though, and I’m now moving towards a carb balanced diet and keeping my net caloric intake at 1,600. I love keto and it got me to a much better place, weight wise. 

MyNetDiary is by far my favorite as far as food tracking goes, I think it has a better database, and it doesn’t highlight the carb macro like CarbManager does. All that being said- I want to have all of my daily calories burned be subtracted from my net intake,  not just my explicit “exercise” ones. Does anyone know if that’s an option? Thanks in advance."
keto,recipes for deserts or snacks that involve dairy free protein powder?,"Hey everyone!

My GF is keto and eats a lot of whey protein fat bombs as a snack and to keep her protein intake up. She loves them and finds them to be super convenient.

(I've been keto for over 3 years, and I'm somewhat pescatarian, sometimes I just need a break from all the seafood and desire something simple like protein powder)

Thank you!"

keto,Keto Concerns,"Hi Everyone.

I started keto for the same reason most of you did; unsuccessful past diets and this one actually makes sense for my lifestyle.  While I’m thrilled to see I’ve lost 2 pounds in the three weeks since I’ve begun (holy cow, when I saw how many carbs I was eating a day🤯!) I’m wondering if anyone else is tracking to make sure they don’t lose TOO MUCH weight too quickly.  From my experience and studies, it’s dangerous and can be a red flag to the struggles of maintaining weight loss."
keto,On again off again,"Hi all,

You never know how addicting carbs are until you fall off of the keto wagon! I was down 50lbs and my inflammation was almost nonexistent. I fell off after covid hit and I had to work from home. Working from home wasn't helpful for my keto journey. Now I'm trying to get back on and it's so much harder to get back on than it was to start the first time. But I feel like such crap now I know I have to find that resolve I started with the first time around. Has anyone else had such hard time getting back on after falling off for months?"

I’ve played with IF in the past but never had this issue so I’m just wondering what’s up. It’s probably on here too, but are there any useful supplements y’all recommend?

I lost 40 pounds, my anxiety disappeared, and i felt like i was on a constant high of happiness! That’s what led me to start keto once again, a year later. Thing is, I’m wondering if my body still remembers how to be fat adapted? I was fat adapted back then, but then took a one year break, where I resumed my regular eating habits, which included carbs. Now that I started keto again, I’m wondering if my body will have to re-learn how to process and use fat as an energy source? Thank you!!"
keto,Week into Keto and a period randomly came?,"(Crossposted from r/xxketo)

So today marks exactly a week on Keto, I’m doing it to try and treat my Lean PCOS, mainly because of the hair loss it’s causing:( 

Today I suddenly got a period out of no where?! I’ve read on the sub that it can happen from the burning of fat-stores/weight loss, but I haven’t been aiming to lose weight at all and make sure I’m getting atleast 2000kcals a day so I don’t think that could be it.

My periods have never been regular, but this period is certainly unexpected, my last one only finished less than 3 weeks ago??

Am a bit worried about why this might be happening/ what my Keto is doing to my body and my periods and how they might be from here on out?

Any help, advice or experienced appreciated, thanks!x"
keto,Kettle corn almonds,"I want to recreate my love of kettle corn and I’ve discovered during my lowish-carb days that I love “honey roasted” almonds and kettle corn.

keto,Unsure,"I started keto two weeks ago. Was going really well and felt generally great. Lost a few kilos, was sleeping well. The only problem was firstly my wife is a doctor and was against it due to the massively high amount of fat. Secondly, I got one really weird case of pins and needles while I was sleeping, whole left arm was super numb. I got it again a few days later while I was sitting on sofa. I was already taking a multivit and a magnesium supplement, as well as eating plenty of foods rich in b12 and a fair amount of spinach. 

Anyway I gave up on it on Wednesday as it freaked me out, not sure if I should give it another go. I’m about 96kgs and have no health problems other than being overweight. Not sure if I should give keto another go or just go for a CICO approach. 

Any advice from the keto veterans out there?"
keto,S/O to this place for inspiration,"I started keto two weeks ago today and this place has been a huge help. I’m 41 and through the quarantine and being a food photographer writing recipes from home I’d just been eating whatever and drinking way too much and at my biggest ever. Seeing all the conversations about net carbs and having even a virtual community has helped me so much. I got MyFitnessPal going from the start, and have been making meals for myself and my partner. So far, I’m down 15 lbs from where I started but I’ve learned some important things while eliminating things from my diet. I normally can’t eat that much cheese without feeling bad but it turns out that it’s because I almost always eat it with bread or starches. On its own with meat or veg does me right. Since I’m documenting what I’ve been cooking etc, at some point I’ll share a link to the better recipes I’ve made with photos etc to give back info to this great community. 

A few food tips that I’ve found useful for thickening sauces involves onion, mushrooms and a vitamix blender. If you don’t have a fancy big blender, pick up a hand blender for $30 and it’ll work the same for this. Basically to make super thick sauces, I’ll sautee 4 oz of mushrooms in fat and half an onion diced up. Once they’re lightly browned I’ll toss in some bone broth to deglaze the pan, add a pinch of salt and some fresh herbs. Puree the mixture, adding more stock if it’s too thick. You’ll have a glorious thick gravy that has the deepest flavor. I’ll occasionally also add in a spoon of Mexican crema/sour cream/creme fraiche if I want a creamier flavor etc. it goes amazingly with roast chicken leg quarters or pork chops. 

Anyway, I’ll be posting more as I go along and maybe I’ll make a few short tutorials for some of this stuff. I’m a visual learner so I know reading isn’t always the best way to follow along with a new idea in the kitchen."

I don't use dairy products at all as I'm lactose intolerant, and I haven't eaten any sugars in years. Is this normal?

keto,End of January Weigh In,"What's up guys, I'm pretty new at Keto (New Years resolution) but I just wanted to share my progress. Initially I was having trouble losing weight, when I weighed in two weeks into January I had only lost a couple of pounds. But then I saw on here that some people were only eating one meal a day since fat is filling and I gave it a shot. Proud to say the previous two weeks I have lost \~8 pounds doing Keto OMAD and I am now down from 240 to 229!

Random chest/heart pain has stopped too, so I no longer worry about having a heart attack at random. Even if this progress doesn't continue, shaving off 10 pounds in a relatively short amount of time has been a great experience for me and I encourage anyone struggling with weight loss to also try OMAD!"
keto,Keto viable bread?,"One of the things I miss a lot in keto died are proper sandwiches. I tried many recipes for keto friendly bread but none of them got even close. Recently I've found this by accident:

https://www.ocado.com/products/the-heart-of-nature-pure-grain-bread-373485011

The macros label says it's 11.8g carbs per 100g so it would definitely be out of the question, but then it also says the fibre is 13g per 100g, so it lands it in negative net carbs (11.8 - 13 = -1.2)?

Does this even makes sense? Does anyone know if this bread is safe on keto? I tried it and it is absolutely awesome bread substitute, but I'm afraid the carbs amount is way too high for keto diet."
keto,Another go at Keto-Tips from someone who finally gets it.,"Good Morning.

Context.  Have been moderately successful at keto a couple different times in my life (started when it was called Atkins). The failures had more to do with me and my refusal to to fully adapt to the keto WOE than with keto itself.   I am now having success like never before.  A few things that have changed for me, that may help you. 

1.  This second round of quarantine/stay at home, I have achieved fat adaptation like never before (started this round Nov 2020).  Not having to go to the workplace and bring lunch, or be tempted by an out lunch, have been huge advantages.  With shopping restricted or discouraged, I focus on eatting (the good food) I have bought at the grocery store.  I can have all the water I want, all the bathroom breaks I need, and don't need to describe my WOE to anyone.

2.  All the above has helped me control hunger like never before.  I see how Keto allows you to CICO a lot easier.  But for coffee and water, nothing in the AM.  Light lunch, bigger dinner, and that's my 1500 or less calories per day, and I feel great.  

3. Tracking!  I had made half assed attempts before, but have now been tracking everything since November.  It allows me to not miss the secret and 1 and 2 carb per servings that added up when I didn't track, perhaps making my last attempts at ketosis harder.  Light bulbs constantly about what has a lot of calories and what doesn't .

4.  I'm not saying quit drinking, but all this gets a lot easier if you do.  Not easy, I know.  I've not had much hooch since starting in November, and not a drop this month.  I bought a case of non alcoholic beer (Partake in Toronto makes amazing craft-style near beers).  It gives me that beer satisfaction with certain meals, or after exertion, but doesn't encourage me to have another, like even a 3 or 4 percent may.  

5.Food as fuel.  I feel my self breaking the food addiction others have identified.  Making a plan for the day, with what to make for dinner bearing a lot of weight on the day, is gone.   The constant need for variety, and lots of food and shopping, is gone.  I have gone through some days on OMAD, and can see myself going a day without a meal.  I find myself looking up Ghandi's thoughts on food and consumption and what that does to us when it is a priority.  I'm not proposing you don't find satisfaction from food, but your waist, wallet and consciousness seem to be better when we don't base our days around consumption. I have a wife and children I still sit and eat with, not wanting to drop that habit.

6 Stalls and NSV.  Have been on one for the past week, as far as the scale shows.  Data has helped me persevere though.  I know my calories are half what I used to eat, and the irrefutable evidence of CICO allows me to know I will get through this stall.   I know my measurements are changing, as I have those tracked.  I know I'm fitting smaller clothes.  A stall usually just means you aren't tracking enough data points.  Add how many books you have read to your data.  Add other points of improvemenr that you believe are related to your new WOE.   Keto changes your life and optimizes you, not just your scale number.

7.  That said, be humble. I'm keeping a laser eye on my diet, and have not started any new exercise program. A person can't focus on multiple things, or have 3 priorities.  Get your food right!  Yes, I'm walking, and Google fit tracks my steps and burn, but that's all.  Nail your fuel, work on the engine and parts after (when you have lots to lose like me).

8.  Keep reading this sub.  I check it everyday, re reading my favourites, noting the tips and all the NSVs.  All you need is in here. From the people who drop 200 or 20, there is something to learn. 

You'll get a progress pic from me someday, but let's be honest, that's for me.  These points are for you.

keto,What does your diet consist off?,"I eat a lot of the same stuff, like literally my diet daily is roughly the same and it’s worked but wondering if I am consuming to much of something .. I portion and weigh everything but a typical week I only eat a limited amount of different foods which are as followed 

Chicken breast, chicken thigh, chicken wings 
Hamburger lean 
Pickles
Lettuce
Eggs
Bacon
Frank’s red hot sauce
Pistachios 
Spinach 
Shredded cheese 
Matador meat sticks (150 calories)
Garlic salt to all meats 
I see the results but wondering if I should add anything .. I cook in a air fryer so use no butter or oil only seasoning . Thanks in advance"
keto,Keto + Cardio/Running?,"I am on day 24 of keto and almost 19lbs down! 34f, sw 239. I used to run a lot. Trails multiple times a week, I did 2 half marathons and a few spartan races and stuff like that too. Never super thin or fast but I love the feeling and the stress relief of running. I haven't been very active with that since going back to school in 2016. Then going back again. Then starting a new career. But I run my ass off at work. 😆 I've been walking/hiking more and I got a HIIT trainer for home which is awesome!

My question is just if anyone has any recommendations or experiences to share with keto and running or frequent cardio. I know keeping my electrolytes balanced will help. I'm hoping if I start running again while my body is in ketosis I will just adapt? I've looked through a few posts here and I do plan to get the book The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Performance since I've seen that recommended a few times."
keto,What tips/recipes/snacks would you put into a 'keto starter kit'?,"My Nan is finally starting keto after being told by her doctor that she's close to diabetic.

Me and my Mum have been trying to tell my Nan to do it for ages, shes finally convinced after seeing a documentary on it (of course, trust the TV)

We're making a little starter pack for her with some snacks, tips and recipes (stuff like to salt your food, drink more water, include some crunchy cheese snacks)

What sort of things would you put in a pack like this? Looking for some ideas to cover the basics for someone starting out"
keto,Not loosing after gainig a lot back during lockdown,"So, after coming to the realisation that I gained a lot back during the lockdown due to not movingas much and eating basically noraml (nonketo) I finally started keto for good (after trying mutliple  times) 2 weeks ago or so.

I manage to stay bellow 30g carbs every day, have a terrible morning breath again and fell good mentally (crazy how you not even really notice how bad you feel with carbs until you feel good again here). Also lots of energy and a good sleep, no stomache reflux. My hunger levels drastically decreased to a point that I am once again baffled to how much/often you want to eat junk eating normal carb food.So I got the usual sign I'm in ketosis.

The carbs I eat come from a bit milk (150ml over 4 or so cups of tea throughout the day) and green vegetables or nuts. I could cut back but tea with milk was both a coffee replacement (it's caffeine free tea) as well as sweets since I sip at it throughout the day.

However, I did not loose a single pound over the last 2 weeks. I track everything and I hit an average of 2200 calories a day, which should be a save 500-ish below my TDEE (which came out at 2772 at sedentary) but my gf and I include unregular walks (2-3 times a week) up to an hour depending on weather so it may be a bit more).

Do I need a bigger deficit or still cut carbs even more?

Edit: Carbs are net carbs. :)"
keto,Are there any Indian websites providing personalised keto meal plans?,"Also has anyone tried it to see if they work? Or are they scams? I don't want to waste my money then, just want something personalised according to my height and weight without going to a dietician. I don't have any where I live ( hello smallvile ).

keto,Keto gave my quarantine meaning.,"Hey there! 

I started university in 2019. Like plenty of other students, I decided I wanted to move in on campus and live at residence. One of the appeals for me at the time was the unlimited meal plan. I figured, I'll be spending so much time on school work and other busy things, so not having to cook for myself would be awesome!

Well, not so much. I'd already made the decision to withdraw from sports to focus on good grades in my final year of high school, and that combined with a pretty heavy depression in my first year of university added up to about 40 pounds I didn't need at all.

By late last September, I realized the weight gain was not at all something I could afford to keep up with, so I made a change. Started doing my research on nutrition and dieting, and keto seemed like the right choice. I installed MyFitnessPal (which was a HUGE help) and went off to the races. I got on the diet in early October, and since then it has been a string of successes which made it all worth it – helping me to cope with the loneliness I've felt during the quarantine. And I've enjoyed the diet, so I don't miss my old ways at all. I've learned so much more about fitness and nutrition too, so I'll be using what I learned from this diet for the rest of my life.

The good news: I lost the weight. All of it. From my starting weight of 200 pounds, I'm down as of today to 160 pounds flat. I'm where I was weight-wise during my track days when I was 16, but an inch taller. The bad news is that most of my clothes don't fit well anymore, hah! But buying some new clothing is a small price to pay for feeling this much better. 

I plan to slim down a little more – just a couple of pounds probably – and then I'll start putting on some more muscle. But I promised myself I'd make a post here once I hit my original goal of 160, so there it is.

TLDR; In 112 days I lost 40 pounds, bringing me from 200 lbs to 160, and from embarrassment at my physique to pride.

I just want a weekly menu/meal plan and I'll follow the same menu every week. If nobody here is able to help would you kindly point me in the right direction? Thank you."
keto,Suddenly gaining weight,"   Hello, so I'm fairly new to keto. I started around 1.5 months ago and things have been going great. I went from 290lbs to 256.3 lbs. Well today when i weighed myself i was 259.6. I have gained 3.3lbs since last Saturday (i check my weight every Saturday). I haven't changed anything in my diet except for consuming a few diet mtn dews this week. Could that have caused a sudden gain? 

  I have only over consumed calories 1 day by like 500. So surely that's not it. I'm thinking that maybe its water weight that I gained from something. Once again I'm pretty new to keto and diets in general so any help would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

For what its worth I am 30 yrs old, 6'3"", and 259.6 lbs consuming roughly 1500-1700 calories and below 20 net carbs daily. Fats and proteins percentages fluctuate depending on the day."
keto,Help! Keto Breath,"Hello Everyone! 
I have a serious question as I’m kinda freaking out! 
I don’t know if this is the keto breath but I have a strong breath kinda garlicky kinda like spices. It won’t go away and it gets strong when I eat. Also that’s all I can smell. When there’s strong smells like coffee I can’t smell the coffee I smell this particular smell....... I’m getting frustrated and  worried. 

Is this keto breath? And if so what can I do to get rid of it? 

Thank you!"

keto,Transitioning from vegan to Keto question . . .,"So this past year or so, I experimented with my first foray into veganism. Not driven by any ethical ideology, just watched ""Gamechangers"" like a lot of people and it was compelling. 

Fast forward and my wife started Keto at the beginning of the year. I've always been more of a high protein/fat, low carb eater and I know it works for me for weight-loss/management, etc. BUT, I've never transitioned into that from literally the opposite end of the spectrum. 

I'm planning on switching over this weekend. It will make grocery shopping, food prep, etc way more economical and efficient with two of us, AND I'm kind of stagnating with the plant-based thing anyway. 

Anyone here made that switch recently with any insights? I'm sure I can expect the keto flu. My body has had more carbs this past year than probably the previous 5+ years combined. But anything else I should be cognizant of?"

I've done keto in the past &amp; managed to lose significant weight (50lbs) but with a really rough winter of seasonal depression, a cross country move to the Midwest &amp; then the pandemic, I gained it all back &amp; then some. I ballooned by 100lbs over the two years following.

keto,Low cost keto foods?,Are there any low cost keto foods? All websites I go to that have keto friendly foods are so expensive. It’s gross.

I just need to have some things on hand for those hard days. Or for myself when I have friends over. I already buy the low carb tortillas etc. I have almond flour and coconut flour. If any websites have AMAZING sales please let me know so I can stock up. I live paycheck to paycheck so  I’m looking for CHEAP keto foods. Samples anything. Thanks :)

keto,NSV: Latching the deadbolt is hard!!!,"So over my weight loss journey, I've had to continually adapt to a daily task: locking the front door deadbolt.

When the weather gets cooler, you have to push in on the door a bit to allow the deadbolt to engage. When I was 350lbs, I would use my large belly to bump the door while turning the deadbolt.

Then one day I noticed that I was almost smashing my face into the door because my belly was mostly gone. It's like my brain still thought the belly was there. So for a while I used my chest and turned my head a little to the side. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now my moobs are alot smaller and I generally have less padding on my chest, so I've had to adapt again by turning to the side and using my shoulder like a normal person.  On top of that, I have MUCH less mass to use, so I have to brace myself and actually put some effort into my shoulder push in order to get the lock to go. 

&amp;#x200B;

I find this whole evolution hilarious in ways that people who haven't ""been there"" (my wife and kids mainly) don't. So I share here for people who likely do get it.

&amp;#x200B;

It's amazing how many little ways I put my obesity to work for me over the years."
keto,"To those who haven't found success yet, why is that?","I'm kind of reflecting on why I haven't reached my weight loss goals, despite making repeated attempts, over many years. I know the responsibility fully lies with me and my actions, but I need to do a bit of self reflection on why I don't ever manage to lose a meaningful amount of weight.

I'm curious to hear from others. when you fail at a weight loss attempt, what's the reason?"
keto,Thoughts on heavy chicken diet,"As someone who has previously relied on Chicken—perhaps a bit too much—I'm curious to hear the stories of others who have taken this route.

Thanks in advance!"
keto,"I don't understand: How does the body lose weight when it isn't in ketosis, like if someone is on a low-calorie, high-carb diet?","I have been reading about weight loss, ketosis, and fasting for years, but the answer to this question still confuses me.

I completely understand how keto causes weight loss and helps with appetite suppression. I do not understand how someone who is eating a low-calorie diet with a lot of carbs involved loses weight, especially people who eat a lot of small meals throughout the day. This would consistently be spiking their insulin/blood sugar. Obviously they do lose weight, but I don't understand the mechanism, since they aren't in ketosis.

I know people like myself are a lot more miserable trying to lose weight on a higher-carb, low calorie diet, because it makes me incredibly hungry all the time. But it's clear the majority of people on diets are eating higher carb, and unfortunately even today, low-fat diets.

Does the body end up dropping into ketosis anyway, sporadically, and that's how they lose weight?"

keto,How I lost 120 lbs :-)," Suzanne Ryan's keto diet before and after story gained popularity because she lost 120 pounds on the diet-without ever setting foot in the gym. After struggling with her weight since childhood, Ryan had tried every diet (fad or otherwise) and nothing worked for her. Then, she came across keto and it completely transformed her life. ""I'd spent my whole life obsessing about food and, for the first time, I felt my appetite decrease,"" she told us. ""This allowed me to think about other things that were important to me and to get out of the hungry haze I'd been living in.""   

This is what Suzanne Ryan says :-  I used to think that losing weight would be the key to my happiness, but it turns out I held the key all along. I had a lot of hurt and sadness paired with only a little self esteem and self love...this combination was tough, and I struggled to find my way for a long LONG time. One day I had enough and decided to start fighting for my life. It hasn’t always been easy, and I’ll always be a work in progress, but I’ve grown so much. Sure, losing weight is great and I feel so much better...but the main thing I celebrate these days is how much I’ve grown as a person...as a mom, a wife, a daughter, and a friend. To be a person who shows up, faces their fears, and extends love and kindness not only to others but to myself.

keto,Can eating too little cause stalls and other long term issues?,"Hey everyone,

Have been a long-time lurker and attempted Keto a few times before but always ended up falling off the bandwagon. I'm nearly 4 weeks in currently and am down 18lbs which is highly motivating and pushing me to carry on towards my goal.

I'm starting to struggle with actually wanting to eat and find that I'm never hungry and even when I do eat it's more of a chore than a requirement which to me doesn't sound healthy at all. I'm just curious if anyone else struggles with the same sort of thing and any advice on how to best avoid falling into a slump. To clarify, I'm getting full really quickly and feel I don't actually don't need as much food anymore to fill me up. I'm taking supplements to help with the required nutrients including electrolyte ones so I'm not suffering from any fatigue or other side effects from doing it this way.

I'm currently doing OMAD with 24 hours-ish between each meal. That meal in itself I'm lucky to hit 600 calories with around 10-15g of carbs given the above issues. Should I swap for a more IF approach and aim to eat 2 meals a day just to ensure I'm eating enough without ruining my metabolism on the way?

Any advice on how to better my Keto approach would be much appreciated!

Im a male. 171 centimeters tall (no idea how much that is in yankee-talk) and I started the keto diet october 1st. I started at 88 kilos. Lost 13 kilos and by Christmas I was down on 75. Took a break during the holidays for 2 weeks. Gained back 6 kilos so I was at 81. No problems, I thought, I will shed that off in no time, just like I did a few weeks back. So I started doing keto again on January 2nd. Same exact diet. Same exact amount of exercise. No difference in ingredients I used. No difference at all. Now, it's been 27 days and I have lost only 3 kilos. I'm now at 78. I don't understand how it's possible? 3 kilos in 27 days when I in October lost 13 in the same time? Also, I should add that I lost the 3 kilos pithing the first few days (January 5th). So, I haven't lost a single gram in 22 days. I'm confused."

keto,2 Minute Immune Boosting Hack Before Bed Accidentally Melted 84 lbs of Unwanted FAT,"irvyirvy There were plenty of ups and downs throughout my journey.

Calm seas don’t make skilled sailors.

Remember, you didn’t get here in a day.  It’s going to take a lot more than a week or two to see real results.

A result is what you get at the end of the journey. You need to focus on your PROGRESS in the mean time.

Sometimes that comes in the form managing your stress better.

Sometimes it’s having 2 cookies instead of 3.

Sometimes it’s maintaining.

keto,I can feel my collarbones?!?!,"(F)20//5ft 3in//SW: 246//CW: 224// GW: 150

I’ve lost 22 pounds so far (I started mid December) and I already feel multiple changes! One of the more interesting changes is that I can feel my collarbones, and they are much more defined now. This was a bit jarring at first because I’m used to feeling... fluffy 😂 My face appears slimmer which is nice, and my jaw is more defined as well. My knee was causing me substantial pain everyday and it’s getting better as I’m losing weight! Even more so, I FEEL better. I feel better now that I’m a bit lighter, but I feel better especially due to the cognitive effects of keto. I can concentrate more and have less brain fog, and I feel more energetic in general. 

I love keto, it’s truly such a great thing."
keto,Lost 8.5lbs in 11 days without calorie counting,"34 female. Hypothyroid patient. 

I've lost 8.5lbs in 11 days going keto. I also do flexible intermittent fasting (cause going too long consistently can worsen thyroid issues). But generally I do around 16:8 fasting (some days 12:12, some days 20:4 when feeling strong). 

No calorie counting. Keeping carbs generally under 30gs a day. 

No insane workout that triggers my thyroid issues. Just walking. And nothing strict or excessive either. 

God i love keto. Feels amazing to be dropping the pounds i gained when undiagnosed. Getting my life and energy back bit by bit. No doubt finally being medicated for it helps too. But just wanted to share. 

And I never feel hungry. I never feel starved. The only time I struggle is pre period time for about a week prior. But I'm getting better over time at preparing fat bombs and crunchy treats (pork rinds) and filling meals (huge steak) to see me through. Also thank god for Lindt chocolate. I'm in love with their 90% dark choc now. Amazing how switching routines makes you appreciate things in a new way . Oh and I love coconut yoghurt with a few pecans and blackberries or strawberries. Finally some tasty treats to dive into when hormones get whack lol.

Is this the whoosh? Or does the whoosh happen via weeing? Also has anyone had the same? I’ll be bunged or semi bunged up for a day or two then it just gets looser looser and then boom waterfalls 😂

Sorry for the TMI any help would be amazing

PS I get fibre from chia seeds nuts and leafy greens :-)"
keto,Accountability Buddy Group :),"Hi All, hope everyone’s doing well today!

Recently I made a post on starting anew, since I was tired of making excuses and how Covid had ruined my healthy lifecycle, with gyms being closed, places shutting down, all the masks everywhere being super depressing, and so forth...

But I’m tired of making excuses and starting yesterday, I’ve created a group on the LINE app (I wasn’t sure what people use nowadays lol), and we already have 3 members :D

The focus of the group is simple: KEEP YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE! By logging what you eat, when you workout, and just about anything! Be free and be yourself!

The main issue I always find myself in, is that, when I mess up my diet, there’s never anyone to tell me I effed up... now, I will feel the shame if I had to post on the group I have messed up. Might be a mental thing, but it’s helped me out a lot!

I’ll stop babbling and post my LINE ID here, feel free to add me and I’ll invite you to our group :)

See you all soon!"
keto,MTC Oil Powder and Ketoactiv ketones?,"Hello. I am fairly new to the Keto diet and Intermittent fasting, since the start of the new year. I weighed in at my heaviest, 260 pounds, in October 2020. I'm in my early 30's and have children. So starting this diet is something I am really working hard to stick with. 
I just completed my 10 day ketone drink challenge and feel amazing! I have now lost 12 pounds this month and still planning on doing another challenge next month. 
In the mean time, I have purchased ketones, MTC oil powder, and collagen. But I'm having a hard time to find information on how to take these supplements. Today I took my ketones with Greens and Wheatgrass, if I don't eat with this brand of ketones it will give me an upset tummy. Then for lunch I had a rainbow salad with olive oil and collagen. Then for dinner I had chicken coconut wraps and baked veggies. Then I lastly took my run with the MTC powder and my protein mix.

What I'm really asking is if anyone has taken these supplements and what their experience was like?
Thanks in advance!"
keto,can you eat more carbs on keto if you're big,"title pretty much says it. how can a small person, say 120 lbs,  and a big guy, say 220 lbs, need the same amount of net carbs (below 20) to go under ketosis. Fucking makes no sense, the bigger dude need more calories = more net carbs."

keto,Keto and the Japanese Diet,"Much has been said about the benefits of the Mediterranean Diet, which some adherents of Low Carb diets modify to what is known as Clean Keto. 

That said, another diet touted to be extremely healthy is the Japanese Diet. Just curious as to whether this would be compatible with a Keto/Low Carb diet. I ask because aside from the emphasis of eating fiber rich foods, which are likely low in carbohydrates, it emphasizes the consumption of less protein,  foods low in fat, and as with most Asian diets, allows for rice."
keto,"For those who hit your target, returned to a traditional diet, and maintained your weight, what's your diet now?",I'm interested to hear from those who returned to a traditional diet of say 50g+ carbs and still maintained their weight.

Have you guys experienced this before? This first time I did keto I lost 10 pounds in 4 weeks and the remaining 10 in another 8 weeks. 

I workout daily as well. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
keto,"Lost 30 Lbs in 6 weeks on LCHF, Doctor Telling Me To Eat More Carbs /Reduce Salt?","I went to a walk-in clinic to check my BP, as at a store machine it was high 180/80.

At the doctors office he measured it with a proper machine and it was 155/80.

I told him I'd recently switched to a low-carb diet, been progressively lowering to a keto level over the last few weeks, starting at about 100g to now around 35/40g, all from whole food sources, no junk.

I'm also doing 16/8 IF with exercise everyday.

I've lost 28lbs in the last 6 weeks or so and feel good.

The doctor told me to cut out the salt completely from my diet and eat more carbs to help offset the blood pressure.

My understanding is that keto is great for reducing BP, so I don't want to sabotage my progress."

Well, due to a lot of life changes and covid, that's been gained back and more. I'm not loving it. I made the decision to start keto again to get healthier and also for typical aesthetic reasons. I have a college friends wedding to go to in May 2022 and I really want to look better, as shallow as that sounds. 
I have no problem being keto, so the main thing that's new to me is the exercise aspect. Usually I just walk a lot and that's my daily exercise, but it's the middle of winter and about 20 degrees fahrenheit most days. So i'm hoping for some advice on beginner exercise!
I'm hoping to loose over 100lbs by May 2022, so my other question to you is....do you think that's possible?

Any advice and help is appreciated!!!"
keto,I've hit a Plateau,"I been doing keto for 6 weeks now and it's been great, in the first month atleast I lost 20 lb.
However in the last 2 weeks i only lost 1 pound and i was wondering why that is, I have a calorie deficit and I only went out of ketosis once at most, can anyone help me?"
keto,"If Ketosis doesn't guarantee weight loss, then why bother?","Hi! Been lurking for a couple months now and got serious with tightening up my calorie and macro tracking and working out 6 days a week. Like many of us here, I am not achieving great success this time around (38/f, 224 lbs, 5""11). 

I hate to be venting and whining on here but this may be my first and only post in the sub. Yes,  I'm also taking measurements - no changes. Yes, its only been a month, BUT its Extremely discouraging to keep at the at tedious food logging if you aren't producing results. NO I'm not drinking any alcohol because I committed to Dry January.

I've read the pinned FAQ stuff and the many responses here that state ""Ketosis doesn't guarantee weight loss"" and ""calories still count"". 

I personally haven't been able to achieve a ketosis level above 1.4 per the blood meter. I know, I know ""don't chase Ketones"" I only use it to understand if my food choices are sabotaging me or not.

If ketosis doesn't guarantee loss, despite eating at a caloric deficit; when why bother cutting out the carbs?

What's the secret? Water? I can only get down about 80-100 ounces  day. If water is the secret then why cut carbs? 

IF makes me miserable and skipping breakfast never resulted in anything ( tried for 30 days)

&amp;#x200B;

I can finally see my lady bits without having to pick up my tummy rolls!

I usually do my grooming in the shower and would just wax it bare because well.. it was easy and didn't require me to actually SEE what I was doing. But now? Ohhhhhhh boy.. NOW I got a cute little landing strip. Why is this a NSV?

&amp;#x200B;

Because I have never been able to see my secret garden without having to be a contortionist. I can just look down and there she is in all her glory! Now that I have no rolls as road blocks, I can now actually groom that area and make it all nice and neat instead of waxing/ shaving it bare. It's not a bad thing to be bald either ladies.. It was just a fat girl dream of mine to have a cute fuzzy landing strip but it was just a hassle to suck it in and bend in ways I shouldn't be able to- Just to sculp some hair. So I've been bald since forever really.

&amp;#x200B;

This is exciting for me and I already feel so sexy and my boyfriend is definitely loving the new look down there.

Yo. So my wife and I decided to do this Keto thing for the new year. And to be honest I didnt have much expectations coming into it. But holy cow - it's only been a little over 3 weeks and we are both down 15lbs. I'm aware most of it will be just water weight, but when I look in the mirror I dont look all puffy and soft like I used to - I'm starting to see some definition. But what's better than that - I FEEL amazing! No more lethargy, no more energy crashes, no intense hunger, clear mind, I sleep WAY better than before... I'm excited to see what a whole year of this would look like. 



I grew up a real skinny kid so spent most of my life tryna bulk up at the gym and by eating 4000+ calories a day (easily over 800g carbs per day too lol...) - but as you can see I just ended up looking soft and bloated, and no matter what I tried I could never get that shredded muscular look. But it feels like I'm on the right track! 



It's so crazy that this is only week 3. Thank you Keto 🙏🏼"
keto,This is when you want to stay strong..,"I’ve been on keto for 2 months and have lost 17 lbs so far. It hasn’t been easy, and I’ve wanted to cheat and a few times I have. But I realized that those moments when I’m weak, when there’s a slice of cheesecake right in front of me left by my roommate, THATS MY BODY TRYING TO TRICK ME INTO GETTING A SUGAR FIX. 

I realized that if I just stay strong when my body is craving sugar, when I’m very weak, the next day I will feel a difference. It’s so subtle and maybe so obvious to others, but last night I was SUPER craving ANYTHING with carbs... I felt like I was going thru withdrawals. And guess what, today I feel amazing. It’s almost as if I battled a monster inside of me and I won. And in defeating the monster, my body submitted. 

Just hoping you guys can stay strong when you feel the least disciplined, it’s in those moments you can make big progress."

keto,Weight Loss: Not Eating Enough Fat?,"27M, 6'2"", SW 263, CW 249, GW 190.  Started keto 1/4/21, had a slip-up day on 1/16.  The macro calculator suggested staying below 30g net carbs, but I have been consistently under 25g net carbs per day (usually under 20).

My two main goals behind keto are:

1. Lose Weight
2. Stable energy throughout the day

&amp;#x200B;

I find I am struggling to meet my suggested fat &amp; calorie intake for each day (I have only met it once).  I know fat is more of an upper limit that doesn't necessarily need to be met, whereas the protein number is a goal to meet.  I have read mixed advice regarding the fat, where some say you don't need to worry about the fat, while others say that you need plenty of fat in your diet to keep your body in ketosis.  For someone like me that has stores of body fat that I am trying to lose, **what are the risks (either to health or ketosis) of not eating enough fat in my diet?  Should I be concerned that my body is not in ketosis if I do not get enough fat?**"

Mild chest congestion.  Restless sleep for two nights.  The first symptom was a rash that lasted one day tops.  I had been taking 4000iu Vitamin D and other general supplements including Selenium.  There is no way to know how much influence any of this had, but I can tell you I would rather have had covid like this than scores of normal colds that I've had over the course of my life."

keto,Keto and Bipolar II Questions - Help,"First of all, this truly is for a friend of mine, someone who didn't want to post directly so I've offered in their place.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a friend who has been diagnosed with a Bipolar II disorder, they were diagnosed a couple of years ago, they have never been manic although they do get hypomania, now trying Keto they think that higher ketone levels could be triggering their symptoms more than before.

Their GP was no help as the GP did not even know what the Keto diet was about, thinking it was impossible to survive without carbs and that in the GPs opinion diet couldn’t affect bipolar.

My friend has long hoped that keto would stabilise their symptoms, much like it does with epilepsy because there are crossovers with drugs that are effective for epilepsy are also used with bipolar.

My Friend has long suffered with periods of depression, not SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder), basically they walk around like a constantly tired zombie, with periods of high energy and constant happiness, nothing really life changing, and they did not ever seek medical help because it was put down to SAD.

When they started keto they started having more episodes of high energy, racing thoughts, reduced reliance on sleep, overactive talking and euphoria etc, one of the longest periods of this being 5 months, about 6 years ago. They felt amazing but like everything, with a massive high, they had the mighty fall, spending most of 2017 in a depression. This caused them to be referred to a psychiatrist and medication, this has caused them to be relatively ok for the last 3 years.

My friend is now starting to use MCT Oils and aggressive fasting and they are becoming more hypomanic, all the signs are there and family (who know what to look for) have noticed the change. They take lithium (an electrolyte in the same atomic family as sodium and potassium) and they are wondering if this is possibly an electrolyte imbalance caused by keto.

They have tried to find studies on how ketosis might affect people with bipolar but can’t find anything, they are hopeful that by reaching out to a wider audience they will find someone who can point them in the right direction."
keto,Prepare to be COLD!,"I can’t believe I never knew this before now, but *losing weight makes you feel colder!*

I used to be fine walking around in practically just a shirt with my coat over it during the winter. Now I have to wear a shirt, sweatshirt, coat, AND  snowpants over my legs.

keto,"Ketoversary on Monday, In a plateau, weights NSV","Hi! I have been doing keto since the Monday after Christmas and I love it. I’m doing it both to lose weight and to improve my relationship with food, as I have done CICO before and had success. However, when I did CICO restricting calories became unhealthy for me and I was obsessed with food. I went to bed at night thinking about it. Presently I am 157 pounds and 5’2” and shooting for a healthy BMI at the end of my weight loss journey and healthy feelings about my body and food. Keto has been going so well for me, as I was addicted to sugar and that was what I would binge on after I restricted calories and created a famine mindset for my brain. Yesterday I lifted a heavier (from 2.5 lbs and 5 lb weights to 5lbs and 7.5 lbs) which feels like an amazing NSV! I am still in a plateau as of the last few days and aware that muscle weighs more than fat and the scale may not accurately reflect my progress in the way I want it to.

keto,Is anyone else GP telling them to stop keto because they think medically it's not sustainable?,"I am a die hard keto advocate. Recently my blood pressure has gotten very high for someone my age 29M. 

I've tampered and experimented with keto twice for about 2 months, both times. The third time I was on keto my GP said it has a good possibility to do with my keto. I strongly disagree. But I just look like an idiot arguing it with a ""medical professional"". 

So I stopped for now. But after eating a normal diet for about 6 months+. My blood pressure was still the same whether I was on keto or not and they put me on pills. 

This weekend he's gonna put me on another pill. That's 2 pills for 1 illness. I'm beginning to think the dirty medical monopoly hook scam has started. I'm in finance so I'm pretty paranoid and cautious of that.

The reason why I believe I have hypertension/high blood pressure... 

- Both parents has it genetically. Mum has it in bloodline. Dad just didn't care about health and worked like a slave so he got it. 

- Financially stressed

- Mentally stressed

- I stopped gymming, dieting and being healthy in general because Dad passed away from cancer early 2020 then corona happened.

I recently just got back into swimming, weights and calisthenics. So I am doing better than the pass. I am not here for grief and pity. But those are the reasons why I think my blood pressure rises. With swimming and keto. It should lower it and I should be off the pills soon.

TLDR: Just curious if anyone else around the world has been told off by medical professionals/dietitians that keto is bad/unsustainable while there are so many people and studies showing godly results. it actually is healthier than other methods if it's done right and NOT just fried bacon and diet coke. 

Will be back on keto end of next month. Keto ftw. All hail keto. Keto til I die!"

keto,OMAD,"I switched to OMAD maybe 6 months ago. I have lost 80 pounds I think since I started 1.5 years ago. My question is if anyone has noticed negative effects from eating the same thing every day. I eat the same meal 12 out of 14 days. I have been doing this for 6 months and haven’t gotten sick of it. I figured consistency is the key. My meal
7-9 ounces of salmon with the skin
1 portobello mushroom cap
12-14 asparagus spears
2 ever good hot links
2 avocados

I work in a lab so I run my labs once a week. I did notice my BUN and vitamin B12 were quite high. To rule out liver disease I ate chicken thighs instead of salmon for a week. The BUN went back to normal so the elevation is purely diet based not causing actual damage. Just was curious if there is anything negative in regards to keto and weight loss eating the same thing.
Thanks"

Not sure if it’s because it’s way back in the back of the fridge where sometimes stuff freezes or because it’s made with non traditional flour but it looks perfectly fine. No mold. Is it ok to eat?
keto,Anyone here a keen baker with some recipes/recommendations to share?,"Hey there, I started doing keto three weeks ago and have had success so far, down 4kg and have just felt better in terms of energy and mood. 

One thing I miss though, is baking. I have pretty good self-control, I bake more because it's a hobby and I find it relaxing and I either give most of the baking away or keep it in the freezer for when I really want a sweet treat. I'm looking to make something keto that I can keep in the freezer, has anyone got any suggestions?"
keto,Thickening agent,"I really like teriyaki chicken. Recently made some over cauliflower rice. I used g Hughes teriyaki marinade, but it was too watery. I want to thicken it up next time. What is keto friendly that can help with that? I used about 4 tbsp of the marinade, how much of the thickening agent would I use? I can't really make my own teriyaki sauce, so that's not an option."
keto,My birthday is coming up! What do I do?,"Hi guys! 

Background: 

SW: 101.9kg (224) GW: 70kg (154)

I’ve been on keto since the 9th of Jan. I’ve lost 2.7kg (just under 6 pounds) I feel amazing, I’m no longer sleeping from 6-8 when I get home from work, I can concentrate more at work, and don’t feel the need to constantly snack! I’m in the mind set that I’m going to be eating this way for the rest of my life now!  

On that note, my birthday is in a week, and I have two options. Do we order take away, and get a cake and have a couple of drinks to celebrate, since we’re in lockdown and can’t do anything else, or do I make steak with asparagus, and a keto cheesecake which I’ve enjoyed? My other half doesn’t cook and I don’t know if I feel like cooking on my birthday. 

So - could I have some pros and cons of each? 

Thank you!"
keto,Any ONE ingredient fat bombs?,"tldr: Are there any effortless fats with no carbs?

I find it hard to eat a lot of fats while also keeping proteins low. They usually go up together with proteins having the same percentage as fats by the end of the meal. I’m looking for a good ONE ingredient fat bomb to minimize effort and dishes. Like maybe a spoonful of low carb/protein peanut butter or something. Or for less tasty fats, I’m willing to freeze it and swallow it like a pill if I have to."

keto,Undereating on Keto?,"Hello! So I (25F) just started keto about 7 days ago, and I have been using mycarbmanager to track macros. However, I’ve noticed that I am eating very little calories (around 1,100). I feel very full all the time and don’t feel the need to snack which is great! But just worried about how little energy I am getting. I also workout 5 days a week which is why the little amount of calories in concerns me. Is this normal? Any tips? Do I just force feed myself haha?"

keto,Good ways to protein.,"Hello, I'm not new to keto but I'm fairly new to doing it correctly. This time around I'm counting micronutrients and used a Keto Calculator to tell me how much mn's I should be receiving in a given day. I've heard that fat is something I should use as a maximum number and try to limit, protein is one I should try to hit, especially since I started lifting. However, my number of 160 grams of protein seems very high even when I'm eating chicken and other meat and struggle to reach that number, especially with intermittent fasting. I also have protein powder but it has around 13 carbs per 49 grams of protein so I try and withhold. Buying pure protein is an option but expensive, is there any good ways of getting more protein without eating alot of calories? Thanks."

keto,Tell me your favorite keto chocolate chip cookie recipe! Or keto dessert!,"Per the title...A bit crispy on the outside and soft, chewy on the inside. 

I bought all my keto cookie ingredients and  followed the diet chef's 1 minute microwave chocolate chip cookie. Super easy, supposedly fool proof. The comments made it seem like eating this cookie could bring one to full orgasm. 

My verdict? I love sweets, but I thought the cookie was just OK. I knew it wouldn't taste exactly like a flour cookie, but the almond flour made the cookie taste a bit bland even with the chips. (Reminded me of a time I used rice flour for pancakes--I could definitely tell it was rice.) I shared the cookie with someone who's not on keto, they took one bite, made a face of disappointment, and put it back on my plate. The cookie wasn't terrible, but left a lot to be desired. Plus it's 270 calories per cookie! Any other suggestions appreciated!"
keto,"Day 3, doing ok","Day 3 of Keto, and BOY is the Keto Flu strong!! I’ve never even had flu symptoms this bad, and I hope I never do. Thankfully, I’m accustomed to trouble sleeping, so that’s a decent symptom to tolerate. I’ve been eating eggs, veggies, and low-carb fruit, along with some nuts and popcorn (which is relatively ok in the carb department). I’ve also been drinking bulletproof coffee every day. Today was the first day I ate something not Keto-approved: 3 Air Fried French Fries. I’m not going over the carb count (it was only like 3-5 carbs), and my family made them specifically for me, so I ate some. I honestly hate how I feel right now. I wish I hadn’t eaten them; it feels like I swallowed gum or something. And I LOVE French fries so that’s unusual. This isn’t my first time on Keto, so I’m fairly acclimated to the restrictions. I wouldn’t recommend cheating AT ALL if you can help it. Also, a fair amount of salt and water helps with the flu symptoms. Good luck, everyone!! You can do this!!"
keto,Tips for folks without too much weight to lose?,"Hi there! I've been on keto less than a week and loving it already. SW: 152, CW: 147, GW: 135. I'm 5'6"" F, never been overweight, just always on the edge. I'm very athletic and such, but have never really *looked* athletic and have always dealt with strong cravings and a really big appetite. I've found myself so much less hungry on keto, and am realizing that so much of what I called ""hunger"" was actually cravings for sugar and carbs. I'm sure what I've lost so far is all water weight and that things will slow down, but even so, I'm loving it! 

I find it almost impossible to ever eat fewer than 1400 calories, my hunger is just so intense I can't fall asleep or wake up in the middle of the night. Right now i'm still losing (water) weight at 1500 cal (20g carb) and exercising daily, but I know that will slow down. So my question is, any tips from folks who have successfully slimmed down on Keto when they were a healthy (if slightly chubby! :) weight to begin with? I'm worried I'm just going to plateau SO hard in a couple weeks, and want to keep things going without being ravenous. I'm also curious, in general, how folks adapted their diets to fit in endurance exercise and keep weight coming off within a healthy weight range without being super hungry. And any other tips within other realms of keto welcome! Thanks so much!"

keto,Dizzy spells while fasting. Help please?," I am at the point in my keto journey where I am comfortable with not eating for long stretches of time. I was planning on doing a 3-day water fast and I was not hungry once during the first day. I was lying down while watching TV about 20 hours in and I got up to drink water. I felt this overwhelming dizzy spell that felt almost like a body error. It's that thing when you get up to quick and you get flashes but like x 30 and like nothing I've ever felt before. I had to eat out of fear of fainting and worrying my parents. I did not supplement anything, I just drank water the whole day. I wasn't hungry at all ao I know it wasn't that.

keto,What's been de-railing me and how to break it,"I think I finally understand why I've been unsuccessful losing weight for years, even while doing keto. I've been chronically stressed for years, and after a long day all I would do is sit in front of the TV until I pass out. But for some reason, watching TV triggers this insane craving for snacks, it doesn't even matter what it is, I just want to EAT SOMETHING, even if I just had dinner. Does anyone else experience that? Sometimes I don't even enjoy the food, I just desperately want to eat. To be honest, confessing to that makes me very uncomfortable, but I kinda have to come clean to move on.

This evening I'm not doing that, I've been tending to my plants and will then watch TV and do a pedicure. I've told myself that I'll not be snacking in the evenings all week and will stick to it. I just wonder why I have to fight these cravings and would love to hear if anyone else deals with this."

keto,Tips to stay out of Keto on a VLCD?,"Hey Guys! This might be a rather unusual question, but I was wondering if anybody could give me some tips how to stay out of keto on a Very Low Calorie Diet. Im following a program of low cal shakes that replaces meals, and I really want to stay out of keto!   
Daily carb intake is about 33g-44g carbohydrates.   
I want to make sure I stay out of ketosis without adding too many calories! Any tips?  


And also; could it be an idea to maybe exceed my caloric litmit by 200 cals and peak with about 90g carbs every third day? Could that be enough to knock me out of it before it sets in?

PS: Many people are probably wondering why I wont just go into keto - it's because I've already tried it, and even though I made progress and really liked the diet - the transition off of it really messed up my skin in terms of zits and pimples. I have sort of a skin condition that I've had under controll for a few years that acted up again during or at the end of keto!

keto,A little confused.,I’m just beginning to attempt keto. There’s a lot of websites that pertain to keto but I’m still not sure what to eat.

keto,How many grams of carbs can I actually get away with?,"Hello all,

Currently on the fence as to whether or not I want to do low carb or keto. Bored with the SAD and want to try something different. Currently coming off a bulk, sitting at 5’11 220, 17% body fat. As of now I lift 3x a week (mwf) run 2x per week (Tuesday/Thursday typically around 30-45min at 150bpm) and train kickboxing/ MT Monday- Friday. Essentially every day is a double session. Monday’s and fridays are hard sparring days where my heart rate will reach the low 180s. These sessions are long. Given my exercise schedule, can I get away with under 100g carbs but over 50g carbs and still subscribe to a Keto diet? Today is my first day and I’m already at 60g carbs so I’ve already blown the 50g threshold."

keto,First night of keto questions,"Evening yall, 

I’ve just completed my first night of keto after a 24 hour fast to jumpstart the whole ketosis thing! I was wondering if y’all could help me with this thing that’s been nagging me.

I’ve eaten 1400 calories and am done for the day. I was wondering how calorie deficits work when it comes to weight loss and general tips regarding that.

According to my smart watch, I’ve burnt around 2.3k in the two days I’ve been trying to lose weight and it seems sustainable (I’ve woken up with blood rushing to my feet and soreness). My BMR is around 2.2 k since I’m morbidly obese (whoops). If I continue on a daily approximate intake of 1.5k with around 1k calories burnt daily I’ll have a daily deficit of 1.7k calories. Which translates to a weekly of 11,900 calories. If 1 lb of fat is equal 3500 calories, that’s around 3.4 lb of fat a week

My workout is a mixture of walking on a steep incline and weight training so I don’t think I’ll lose too much muscle, is it safe to assume that most of my weight loss will be fat? If so, is it reasonable to look at losing approximately 3 lb a week? Also, I generally drink around a gallon of water a day, is that enough for keto?
Sorry for the loaded question and thank you!"
keto,Gross carbs v/s net carbs.,"So as a recent ketoer(is that a word?) there is supposedly a lot of keto-friendly ready made foods available. But if we take a look at the nutrition label, its starts with a high carb content but then they take off the sugar alcohols and dietary fiber carbs and viola the carb content is magically much lower than before.

keto,Getting more protein without eating more fish and meat,"Hello helpful people,

I started again about 10 days ago and already lost 3 kg (6 pounds). I am very happy about that.

But I do worry a bit because I don't seem to get enough protein. I am eating mainly beef, lamb and wild salmon for protein right now, and I can't eat more of that than I do per day. Some almonds are in the mix too. 

I thought about buying some hemp protein powder maybe, but I would love to manage that without any powders etc. I have almond butter here, but I can't think of what to mix it with. And I am not a fan of just taking spoons of nut butter and eating it. What do you eat with your nut butters?

Also I am trying to go without gluten and casein at the moment and having only few lectines. So milky things like Greek yogurt I ate the last time and peanuts are out of the mix. I will try to reintroduce those things into my diet in a few weeks, but I want to learn if I might not get along good with some of these.  And I am very allergic to eggs, so they are not an option. 

Any nice egg-free recipes are always appreciated by me. I would love to make some keto wraps myself.

keto,Has anyone tried a Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)?,"I came across [this study](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12020333) which looked at the efficacy and safety of a VLCKD in patients with obesity and mild kidney failure. The study consisted of 92 patients with obesity (23 men and 69 women) following a VLCKD for approximately 3 months. 38 had mild kidney failure (experimental group) and 54 had no renal condition (control group). The VLCKD consisted of a very low carbohydrate content (&lt;20 g/daily), 1–1.5 g protein/Kg ideal body weight, 15–30 g fat/daily and about 500–800 caloric intake/daily based on calculated ideal bodyweight. Patients experiences a mean body weight decrease of nearly 20%, and a significant reduction in fat mass (80% of total weight loss) in less than 3 months! It was noted that the advantages of a VLCKD are the rapid weight loss obtained, satiety induction, and muscle mass preservation which all increase compliance. 1.1% of patients were deemed as non-responders, with &lt;5% weight loss achieved; 11% reached a weight loss between 5% and 10%; the majority of patients lost 10 to 20% initial weight (63.7%), with 24.2% reaching a weight loss equal to or exceeding 20%. Some of the experimental group (27.7%) even reported normalization of glomerular filtrate after dietary intervention. The study concluded that VLCKD is an effective and safe treatment for weight loss in patients with obesity, including those affected by mild kidney failure.

I find these results quite exciting! Obviously, it's no surprise that consuming 500-800 calories a day will result in rapid weight loss, but I would have expected a higher loss in muscle mass, other medical complications, and lower compliance. Patients only reported minor side effects such as constipation, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea, fatigue, hunger, and dizziness, but none were deemed intolerable and, most often, were resolved within the first few days of the dietary intervention. The mean age was 51.3 ± 12.2 years and the mean BMI was 33.8 ± 5.8 kg/m2. There was no mention of any physical training programs followed by any of the patients.

I would imagine these middle-aged, obese individuals are probably not working out regularly. I wonder if, and to what degree, a strength training program would inhibit the minor yet significant loss in muscle mass (20% of total weight loss). Has anyone tried a VLCKD? What are your thoughts on the results of this study?"

keto,Lost all the weight I gained since 2013,"SW: 175 lbs CW: 138 lbs GW: 130 lbs

When I started college in 2013, I had little to no control over what and when I ate. I basically ate ever time I craved anything or felt hungry. I also ate to cope with stress. Before I knew it, even years after I graduated, I ballooned to 175 lbs. I started to notice how much I’ve gained when I felt embarrassed looking at pics of my face, then at some point, I noticed I couldn’t even cross my legs. Seeing 175 lbs on the scale broke me. I was really unhappy with myself and how I just didn’t take care of myself, so I started keto with my now bf in august 2020. Had a bit of a hiccup during the holidays, but got back into it in January of this year, and MAN it felt so good to see the difference. I’ve lost around 35 lbs, and I feel much more confident in myself now. I feel great when I look at myself in the mirror or in pictures. I’ve kicked sugary drinks. I drink diet or zero sodas/teas now, and I honestly can’t tell the difference so I don’t really have a reason to go back. I’m much more mindful of my calorie intake. I feel hungry less often now. I actually feel energized in the morning. I think the best part of keto so far though is that some of my clothes from high school fit me again. Dude, I just feel sexy lmao

I wanna lose like 5-10 more. My goal is to get down to the weight listed on my drivers license at least lol. 

I’ve never stuck with a health goal in my life until keto and weight loss, so I’m hella proud of myself for the restraint and control I’ve shown to get to where I am. It’s crazy to see your hard work pay off. Hell, I think I’m gonna start some more guided exercises so I get toned. I just feel like I can do so much with my body to improve it and it feels great knowing I have the ability and discipline to follow through. 

Thanks for reading my ramblings. All y’all are doing great! Keep it up bc it’s so worth it!

keto,Down 30lbs in 5 months,"Hi All! Happy new year and hope everyone is having fun on their weight loss journey! I’m posting this as motivation for anyone who is just getting started or struggling with their IF or Keto Journey.

I started my journey back in August 2020. At the height of the pandemic I must admit that I was not at my best. I was depressed and slowly slipping into very destructive behaviour (mostly with alcohol abuse - what else can you do when you’re stuck at home eh?). 

I decided to take control of my health when I took a look at myself and realized that I had gained a lot of weight - like a LOT (mostly over time but the pandemic did not help at all). I went into full Keto and IF mode and I’m glad I made that choice. There were a few “pauses” here and there mostly for things like my birthday, my brother’s wedding as well as Christmas. But it’s almost end of Jan now and here are my results

28/ M/ 5’9

SW: 213.6 lbs 28.1% BF

CW: 181.0 lbs 20.8% BF

GW: 160.0 lbs 12.5% BF

I started out by doing 18:6 with IF to get a couple of hours of fat burning. Now I’m comfortable with doing OMAD (basically 23-24 hours of fasting a day) and that has helped a lot.

I also workout daily - I run about 5-6KM every morning and do atleast 20 minutes of HIIT workout. My aim is to burn around 600-700 calories a day from workouts (thank you Apple Watch competitions for keeping me accountable). 

In terms of food I keep it strictly Keto (mostly veggies and protein) as well as always being in a caloric deficit. Apart from my “pauses” I’ve been pretty consistent (I test my self with a ketone strip every week just to make sure). I haven’t had much alcohol (or any) since New Years because I know I tend to over do it sometimes, but I am planning on incorporating it back into my life in a healthy way (maybe a glass of wine here and there, little/no beer, whiskey on the rocks as opposed to mixing it with pop etc - I welcome any suggestions from people who have gone through this transition!). 

I was happy to step on the scale this morning after my workout and see I’m almost back to 170s (I haven’t seen that number in about 5 years!). I have another week of clean eating before I have my first cheat meal of the month (already got my chicken wings marinating) and then it’ll be back into the grind for February. I still have about 20 ish lbs to go - once I hit my weight goals (hopefully this year) I’ll be posting before and after pictures.

Again - for all those struggling with your journey just remember, you’re not alone and you GOT THIS. 

TL;DR: lost 30lbs in 5 months with Keto and IF."
keto,How to eat proper amount of calories without carbs!?!?!!!,"I’m 270 about 35% body fat 5’10 25 years old.  My BMR is 2,200-2,400 calories.  I work out 6 times a week but now thinking about how is it possible to get 2,200 calories of non carb food down without eating all day long.  I’m confused I need 270 grams of protein and 2.200 calories without a single carb? Sounds impossible or it sounds like 4-5 protein shakes a day and a dozen eggs a day.  So here’s my question what are peoples meals like and what’s the schedule for anyone ketoing and eating 2000 calories + a day?"
keto,Stalled but gained weight...,"Hey all.

My current stats is 10-15 net carbs a day and 1000-1200 calories a day. I was starting to lose 1-2 lbs a week for 3 weeks then it all gained back. I did recently added a zero net carbs bread from thinslimfoods.... Maybe they add fiber to make it fake net carbs?? I could see this happening."
keto,Working out on Keto and IF...,"So I’ve been doing keto and a 16:8 IF every day for 2 months. So far I’m down 38 lbs!

I want to start working out and building up some muscle but I’m not sure how I should adjust my macros and if I’m gonna be super hungry afterwards. I only have time to work out in the morning. 

This is really giving me anxiety. So much so that I’m afraid to even start because I feel like it may make me fail. Does anybody have any advice or personal routines that work?"
keto,Is weight loss of 3-4 lbs a week sustainable?,"45F current weight 170, goal weight 145

My normal weight is 145. That’s a weight I naturally maintain except when pregnant or BF. I recently stopped BF and am now looking to lose the baby weight. I am one of the lucky ones who gains weight while BF. 

I started keto a little while back, but didn’t focus on CICO. I lost the water weight and had very slow weight loss. 

I got more serious about CICO and intermittent fasting. I’ve done intermittent fasting most of my life naturally. I didn’t know there was a name for it. I’m not usually hungry in the morning and don’t eat until anywhere from 10am -noon. 

I have an eating window of 6ish hours. I alternate between days of eating 1200+ calories, followed by days of eating 1000- calories. I find it easier to have 1000- days when I have 1200+ days mixed in. 

So far I am losing 3-4 pounds a week. At this rate I will reach my goal weight in 3+ months. 

Anyone have a similar experience or success using a method like this."
keto,No more weight loss,"Help! I’ve stalled since November. 
Staying under 25-30 net a day. 
Haven’t lost a pound since November. I’m frustrated and exhausted from this. 
Too many veggies ? Not enough water ? What could the culprit be !?!"
keto,Is there any point to doing keto for just a week?,"Can’t seem to find an answer on the web to this - Me and my partner are on Covid weight loss journeys at the moment, going pretty well so far although only a few ‘serious’ weeks so far. Few years ago lost a lot of weight so this is my second time round ever doing this. 
We are just generally doing CICO - however, we were thinking that when we are a bit further along and have hit a slowing of weight loss, almost like a plateau, of doing keto for a week to ‘kickstart’ our bodies back into weight loss mode. Then further down the line maybe repeat this process. 

Whilst my partner could probably do keto long term because he’s not so bothered about food, I am a huge foodie and baker (used to have a food blog!) and it’s not realistic for me if I want to keep my hobbies! But I am very excited to try keto recipes for a shorter period of time :) 

My question is: is there any point to that? Will that work, even if we are only in ketosis for 3-4 days overall? (Since it takes a few days to start) or is it not worth it unless it’s a long term thing?"
keto,Hello. I'm celiac. Male 26.,"I can't handle gluten because that provokes me autoimmune problems. Gluten caused to me thyroid problems and arthritis. I also have irritable bowel syndrome so I can't eat fiber either because it causes me inflammation problems, lots of gas, focus problems, lack of energy and uncontrollable flatulence, which is socially terrible.

&amp;#x200B;

I have had arthritis since I was 5 years old, but we just discovered that it was all due to celiac disease when I spent 2 years being vegan and ended up in hospital with a crippling attack of arthritis. During that time of being vegan I also got irritable bowel syndrome and thyroid problems due to problems with fiber in vegetables.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite all this, after the years of veganism I went on a sloppy diet. I ate anything, what everyone eats except soda, soy and fiber. By chance I met r/sugarfree and without realizing it, I have now been without sugar and flour for 4 days in a row. Also doing OMAD the last 4 days.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel better. No more bloating, I don't have 20 gas per hour. Less mood swings caused by sugar. I didn't have a gas all day.

&amp;#x200B;

So this is what I'm eating now: cow (meat, kidney, liver), bovine fat in packages, chicken, eggs, cheese, butter, rice, potatoes, yams, and a minimum portion of some plants like lettuce."
keto,24/01/21 (Day 5),"Just holding mysslf accountable and documenting my daily total carb intake. With each passing day, definitely feeling better. I find it so fascinating how carbs can have an effect on one's emotions (I speak for myself), definitely feeling more balanced and zen like.

14g total carbs!

As always, hope every one is well and doing well. KCKO 😊"
keto,How much electrolytes for a 18 yr female?,"I have been doing keto for 4 days now. I’m struggling with keto flu: fatigue, weak, etc. I’ve been eating foods high in potassium and magnesium such as avocado and spinach. The FAQ says that you need like 5,000 mg of sodium for an average adult. I’m definitely not consuming that much sodium everyday. Should I be? I’m 112 pounds (not trying to lose weight just want to have more energy)."
keto,Keto has drastically changed my relationship with food-- and with myself.,"Hi everyone! Just a little bit of background, 26yo female, my husband and I started keto in July 2020 and still going strong! It has provided a ton of benefits: I have lost 30 lbs, I have more energy to be active, I think clearer and I'm overall just more productive and confident in myself!

Prior to keto, I was an emotional and impulsive eater. I never thought about the nutritional value of food, I just wanted and craved certain foods all the time. I was also lazy about cooking which is where this post is going.....

Yesterday I realized that before keto I didn't value my body or think of myself as ""worth it"" to put in the effort for cooking nutritious meals. If I ever cooked for others, I would put lots of care and concern into the ingredients, and overall put time and energy into the meal because I care about the people who would be eating it and I wanted it to be nice for them.

But then if I ever was cooking just for myself..... I would whip up the quickest tasty thing I could find (bagel and cream cheese, quesadilla, or just fast food, you get the idea). 

Yesterday, I made myself a full breakfast of eggs with spinach, halloumi, and bacon. It might not sound like much, but the addition of spinach and halloumi made it feel so FANCY and healthy that I was ecstatic to eat it. And then it hit me.... I value myself and the fuel that I put into my body so much more now than I used to. Nowadays I'm willing to put the extra 15 minutes or extra 2-3 ingredients into a meal that will make it more nutritious and more enjoyable. I'm just overall more thoughtful and intentional about my food, and I am more concerned now about choosing things with actual nutritional value.

It hit me yesterday that keto has taught me a whole new meaning for ""self care"". 
I now feel like I am worth the extra effort."
keto,Limit of Fatty Acid liberation from Adipose,"Is their a physiological limit to the amount of fat that can be burned from adipose in a day? If you just increase dietary fat wouldn’t the body preferentially burn what’s in the blood stream 1st like glucose. You, also have to take into account the bottle neck in enzymatic function necessary to fat metabolism."
keto,Best keto fast food/Restaurants,Been doing Keto for 1 month with no hiccups but one thing I struggle with is cooking a meal every single night after coming home from a long day of work. Absolutely love Flying Dutchmens from in n out and charleys Philly cheese steaks with no roll. Any other good suggestions and what are your favorites ?
keto,Struggling to eat enough!,"I started Keto a week ago and am really struggling to eat enough of anything. My macros are 1600kcal, 20g net carbs, 75g protein, and 135g fat. 

I've only exceeded 1200 calories twice this week (once went over 1600) and have mostly got 75% of my protein intake, or exceeded 75g. I've never hit my fat or exceeded my carbs. 

I'm just struggling to eat enough! Today I ate: 

Tinned ratatouille with 2 eggs and some stilton; a glass of prosecco; headbanger's paneer makhanwala, and a protein bar. 

I appreciate that much tomato isn't great - I've moved in with my partner who is not Keto - but I'm within my carb limit. I was going to eat a large piece of cheese but just... don't really want it? 

Any advice? This is, like, 900 calories, and I don't want to get sick."
keto,BMI isn't useful...,"I see a lot of people using this wrong so I'm just using this to inform people.

Don't rely on BMI. I see load of people using the BMI or who get upset because they are 'obese' or 'overweight'. BMI only accounts for fat not muscle. So even though I'm shown as obese, I'm in the overweight category. If you take Arnold Schwarzenegger (in his prime) for example, his BMI was obese. This is obviously not true. He had like 0% body fat so he can't be obese.

The BMI scale is only useful for children.

Instead to track your weight loss, measure the diameter around your stomach, arms, waist and other joints. Or invest in a smart scale which tells you you muscle mass and fat mass."
keto,Exogenous keytones?,"I do not support MLMs but I see there are a number of non MLM exogenous keystone drinks on the market. I know that you do not NEED these drinks to enter ketosis or succeed at the diet itself, but do they help? Considering trying some but they are fairly pricey and I'm not looking to waste my money. I'd just like to know if they help boost weightloss in any way? Google is pretty much useless at this point with all the sponsored content it is difficult to find an answer. Thanks for any help!"
keto,Feel like I can't do it (even though I've done it before),"Let me preface this by saying I'm only posting this here because I can't post on r/loseit, possibly because of my account having low karma.

I'm in a 19 year old male, currently attending college. I've struggled with my weight and healthy eating for my entire life, but around 16 I was able to keep myself eat eating 1500 calories a day consistently, and lost about 60 lbs. For some reason, I stopped, and I have been trying over and over again for two years trying to stick with 1500 calories a day (I need to lose 30 lbs to reach my ideal weight).

For some reason, it seems like I'm never able to stay consistent with my weight loss. I'll do well for a day or two, and then collapse. It is really starting to get to me, though I've never gotten so discouraged that I've given up. I don't know if it is due to the added stress of college and adult responsibilities or what, but I just can't seem to do it. I struggle a bit with mental health, but no more than anyone else at my age, so I'm unsure if that is the case.

Any advice?"
keto,Red meat is 30% sugar and is not keto.,"If you slaughter an animal and eat it within 12 hours, 30% of the flesh is glycogen, which is sugar.


However after 12 hours the glycogen turns into dead protein and the meat loses the sugar content.

So therefore there is no real ""keto"" diet."
keto,Keto-Attempt 69: Bodyfat seeks new place of work [M30/5″9]; Day1,"This is an auto-generated text: 

Today is my 2 day of keto. From yesterday to today I've lost 0,6 kg. My total weight loss since starting keto on Jan, 23rd 2021 accumulates to 0,6 kg. When starting keto, I ran the keto calculator ([www.keto-calulator.ankerl.com](https://www.keto-calulator.ankerl.com)) which I consider my baseline. My baseline weight for today was 120,79 kg. I overachieved by 0,49 kg. My caloric intake today sums up to 1438kcal. I am also trying to do IF; today I had only one meal.  My food today consisted out of: Chicken (400gr), Broccoli (400gr.), Eggs (4), Feta cheese (180gr). My mood today was a 2/5 which I would translate into a ""not too bad"". My brain function today was a 2/5 which I would translate into a ""somehow foggy""."
keto,Switching keto for low carb,"I’ve decided today that keto isn’t sustainable or convenient for me. Personally I think keto is a good fat burning diet but for gaining muscle its extremely hard. I’m actually trying to lean/clean bulk.

Firstly, I’ve been doing keto for over two weeks and I have absolutely no energy. It’s ridiculous, my body is even used to low carb diets. My symptoms don’t even match with having keto flu apart from 0 energy.

Secondly, in a pandemic the food restrictions are extremely difficult. I can handle diets easily but I’m not able to purchase the amounts of food required:
- fresh meats, nuts, berries are all fairly expensive in my country and vegetables and eggs also come with their downsides. 

Sadly I’m just losing too much weight and don’t have enough energy nor the financial freedom to “just give it longer”, I wanted to stick to keto but if I move to low carb I’ll be able to consume more calories and also increase my nutrient intake.

I’m also worried medically since I have growth hormone deficiency."
keto,Finally in the 100’s!,"Hey y’all not much to say except I’m officially 196lbs. I’m so excited. I started at 210, F, 27, 5’6” a couple days after Christmas. So it’s about 15 pounds in less than a month! 
I have an autoimmune disease with some suspected muscle degeneration and losing weight has always been a struggle but I finally feel like I found something sustainable that works!"
keto,Is this an effect of Keto?,"Hi I've been on keto for almost 6 months lost 15kg I haven't been very strict with it but I've been doing pretty Ok with minimum exercise...
This happened to me last month or so... And it's not getting better or going away... I have started using moisturizer since this happened but My eyes are crusty, pink and it sometimes burns when I apply moisturizer on it... Also I feel my eyelids are a little heavier sometimes...
My question is, is this an effect of Keto?

keto,Absolutely stunned by 3 weeks of keto!!,"I've only been on keto for three weeks and am absolutely stunned by the change.

I tried to lose weight last summer with running every other day and drinking fruit smoothies for breakfast instead of cereal but it didn't seem to make much difference. Although I made them myself with fresh produce, I realise now that I was ingesting a load of sugar that I probably only just burning off on the runs and hence no weight loss.

I gave up over autumn, indulged a lot  and ended up weighing my heaviest, just over 12 stone at Christmas. I'm 5 foot 7 so this is into the overweight category, and my measurements were 32 waist, 39 tummy and 41 hips.

I decided enough was enough and on January 3, started on a keto diet. I've never done a 'proper' diet before. But I thought I'd give it a go and why go the whole hog - combining it with intermittent fasting. I also vowed to do regular pilates / bodywork and a brisk daily walk with at least 6000-8000 steps. Luckily my dog won't let me slack on that front!

The last pic was taken today. I am 11st 2, and my measurements are 30.25 waist, 37.25 tummy and hip still at 41.

Still a long way to go (I'd like to get to 10 stone) but I wanted to share this as I haven't told anyone I'm doing keto and I'm kinda proud of myself for staying off bread, pasta and biscuits for so long!

But now I see it's really been worth it and I'm going to keep on persevering. Luckily it's starting to get easier.

keto,"Pet Peeve, bone broth","As a matter of definition, ""broths"" do not contain bones. A broth with bones is called a ""stock"". It shouldn't be called ""bone broth"" it is just ""stock"". 

The incorrect use of the words ""bone broth"" are the result of scientists using the wrong word from ignorance of the culinary arts. They were thinking ""oh, lets make a chicken broth, but with bones in it. What should we call it? 'bone broth'"".  This really annoys me and it hurts the credibility of keto in the eyes of nutritionists, dieticians, and people who know how to cook because it is a word borne of ignorance.

So, can we please just start calling it ""stock"" and if people ask how to make ""bone broth"" we can just point them to a decent stock-making recipe?

keto,Hoping keto will help me get pregnant,"My husband and I are both overweight (both in our 30’s) and have been trying to get pregnant for 3 years now with no success. We went to the fertility clinic and they told us that there was nothing wrong with us except that I was over weight, they suggested I try to drop a few pounds and put us on the list for IVF.  Fast forward to last week, we got a call saying that our name came up and we are next in line for IVF.... only i hadn’t lost any weight.  I tried but only yo-yo’d up and down about 10 lbs. Then came Covid (no excuse I know) but with that and the stress of my job I ended up in a slump and wasn’t taking care of my self and ended up gaining an extra 20 lbs.  My BMI needs to be under 40 for the clinic to do IVF and I needed to drop about 40 pounds to get there.  So thankfully the clinic gave me a few more months to reach my goal weight.  Only I don’t want to be just at the cusp of the weight limit, I want to be as healthy as possible so my chances of a successful pregnancy are high. 
All that backstory to say that my husband and I both started keto 8 days ago, and while it was a struggle the first few days, I’m finding I have much more energy. I’m down 10lbs so far, I know that’s not much yet but I’m super happy with such quick results. As for exercise, I’ve been taking long walks (about 4km) 4 times a week and plan to keep that up.  I may add more as I lose weight but for now this is a workout for me. 
I guess I’m posting all this to keep myself accountable, and maybe get some support and tips.  As for motivation, the chance to be a momma is all the motivation I need!  Wish me luck keto friends!!"
keto,"PSA: If you have food poisoning, forget keto for a little while!","Hey. I have been doing keto on and off for multiple a few years now with great success and was in maintenance mode for a while but recently started losing weight again after quarantine got it up a bit.

Anyways, three days ago I got food poisoning from some bad fish.

Food poisoning, ofcourse, is no joke in any situation but I wanted to give a little warning that when you are on keto, it hits much, **much** harder. You carry a lot less water weight, so you dehydrate at a much faster rate (it was seriously astounding), my electrolytes crashed to delirious-state-levels within hours to the point where I had to go to the hospital to get an infusion etc.

To keep it somewhat short - I tried to ""maintain"" a somewhat keto strategy during, which was just dumb. What I should have done is get a bunch of gatorade, or (mild) fruit juices, or anything to replenish minerals and vitamins more quickly, along with some food that is more easily digestable than what I had at home at the time.

In short: Being disciplined is great, but special situations call for special adjustments. Don't be dumb like me. You can always resume keto when you feel better.

I hope this never happens to any of you, but if it does, I hope this helps."
keto,"Plateauing after 2-3 weeks (26M, 365 lbs)","I need some help as my girlfriend and I are hitting some road blocks with the keto diet and intermittent fasting. 

We have been doing IF (16:8 religiously, every day) and we have been doing low carb/keto (most days less than 30g carbs in total for each of us) for 3 weeks. The first week we saw really great progress and lost 7+ pounds each. I started at 375 pounds about 3 weeks ago and today I am hovering at 365 pounds and am having such a hard time going down. We aren’t eating more than 1500-2000kcals every day and it’s completely keto. 

Yesterday morning I weighed 365.2 lbs, we did a 5 mile walk on our fast, and had approximately 1500 kcals in total yesterday, and yet today I wake up and I am still back to 365.2 lbs. I know for a fact I was on a caloric deficit yesterday especially with the calories we lost walking 5 miles. I’m really concerned as to why I’m deep into ketosis every day, doing fasting, and yet I’m not seeing a steeper weight loss. I know water weight fluctuates, but why is my weight stalling only after a few weeks?"

keto,Maintenance CW:170 GW:170,"[maintenance pic](https://imgur.com/a/HU2mhZC)

Hello! Just wanted to post a 1 year maintenance story! I stopped losing and started maintenance around 1 year ago. Lost ~70 lbs with Keto and IF.  I have been eating keto ever since, with the occasional “indulgence”.  My bloodwork last summer came back excellent, and I had perfect blood pressure on my last visit (drinking salt all day DOES work!) After high school when I was a 4 sport athlete and gym rat and still never had abs, I thought I never would. But with body recomposition and body weight exercises (planking circuit FTW!!!) I changed! And although the last year has been weird and for some reason I became a germaphobe and felt uncomfortable at the gym, so I wasn’t able to work on gaining muscle with resistance training but I was able to keep myself around the same weight and body composition eating between 2500-3000 calories/day. I do find it easy to under-eat as i can skip meals without issue. But I think my body found its level at 170, and I have a challenge ahead of me to bulk up once I feel safe in the gyms again (post vaccination) which I am looking forward to. Also, I have made great strides in my personal life this past year, culminating with me living at the ski mountain and skiing everyday this winter while remotely working, which was a dream of mine that I was finally able to make work. And if it wasn’t for KETO and this sub of glorious and wonderful people, I would not be here literally accomplishing life goals and looking forward to newer and bigger goals. Eating this way works for me! I can read 3x faster and retain (and regurgitate) the info even better than ever, AND I am a better skier at this weight than I had ever been before (even in my mid-30’s!) My food staples are avocados with bacon and goat cheese, red meat, butter, keto pancakes(!), Kim chi and sauerkraut, canned salmon, hemp seeds, cruciferous veggies, pork rinds, nut butters and dark chocolate. If I can figure this out, so can you. It is also a great way to develop better discipline in all areas of life as you learn to control your food intake ( 1 pint of Rebel ice cream can last 3-4 eating sessions for me!!) If your about to start this diet, you can do this! If you are still losing, don’t give up! And if you are at maintenance, well then, you’ve made it and congratulations!"
keto,"I did keto for a long time, and it worked great, and why I eventually moved on to something else","I'm a typical guy who hit his 30s and gained a bunch of weight. I was very frustrated because I was someone who ate pretty decently (or so I thought) and exercised regularly, but I couldn't seem to figure out how to get more lean. I'd heard about keto/paleo and figured why not, I'll give it a try. 

I cut out all carbs and ate tons of meat and cheese and occasional veggies. It worked great at first; I lost the initial 10 pounds in only about 10 days, which is pretty typical of losing water weight first. 

After losing the water weight I plateaued a bit, but continued a steady decline in weight, happily eating steak, bacon, chicken, ribs, eggs, and never touching bread or pasta. I felt full all the time and had great energy! 

It lasted about two and a half, almost three months before I cracked. I couldn't stop craving bread, pasta, rice, or potatoes. I wasn't even craving pizza or french fries, I just wanted something starchy. It wasn't long before I cracked, when a co-worker brought in homemade hummus that I couldn't resist. 

The weight piled back on quick. I yo-yo'd up and down for a couple more years, sometimes steering back into strict keto, mostly doing keto-ish diet, and sometimes eating with reckless abandon. The thing that was so frustrating was that a month of strict dieting was easily undone with only a few days of eating carbs (and I'm not talking super bad stuff, just a couple meals with a side of rice or bread). 

Recently, after staying very strict on keto for a few weeks and losing a few pounds, I went to my doctor. She did blood work and took my blood pressure and it was NOT GOOD. My BP was 155/95 and I'm someone that runs 25+ miles a week and lifts weights regularly. I was SHOOK. Doctor immediately put me on a BP medication and said ""you need to reduce salt and saturated fats in your diet and eat more fiber."" 

""But I eat keto!"" I exclaimed. 

She shook her head and said ""not anymore you're not, you are in your mid 30's and have stage 1 hypertension. The meds will help with this, but this only changes permanently with diet. Do you have a family history of heart disease?""

I slowly nodded my head yes. 

And so that began a comprehensive overhaul of the way I eat. 

I first started by looking into the Mediterranean diet. It's a great diet, in concept, but it's really frustrating because there aren't a lot of hard and fast rules in the program. Can you have dairy? Sure, in moderation. Can you have red meat? Sure! Just in moderation! What the hell does ""moderation"" mean!? 

It took me some time though, but I got the hang of it, and it was ultimately the best thing for me, and much more sustainable. One thing is for sure, eating a clean ""Mediterranean diet"" involves a lot of cooking and making things from scratch, so be ready for that. 

Sure, I don't cut weight very easily like I do on keto, but I don't pile on weight because I have some pasta or a couple slices of toast with my eggs. I do enjoy that I can eat carbs, that's for sure, and I don't miss anything in particular, because I find it easier to self-control when I eat steak or bacon rather than never, ever, EVER eating any form of starchy carbohydrate.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* Keto worked great for me short term, but long terms it was always a big struggle. Went to doctor and found keto exasperates my hereditary hypertension and that I need to settle on something different. Tried Mediterranean diet, now I eat a Mediterranean-ish style diet. It's a lot of cooking and making things from scratch, but I really enjoy it."
keto,Keto cycling,"Hey all, I have no intention of doing keto forever. I do appreciate the benefits (mostly the fact that it's the diet that doesn't make me hunger for the whole day), but it's just not for me. I like my carbs, I have no intention of being super thin, I just want to lose some weight because currently it's too much (I lost more than 50kg in the past, but gained a loooot back in the past 3 years).

I would like to ask about the experiences of those doing keto cycling and what intervals do you take when doing it. I don't want to stay without carbs for a long period, then go back and gain a lot of weight because my body is just not used to carbs anymore."
keto,Initial extended fast sabotaging keto benefits?,"So after massively falling off the wagon and gaining the covid-30, I decided to go back to keto. It has typically worked really well for me in the past in terms of weight loss, but I figured this time I would kick it up a notch and start the whole thing off with an extended fast. I fasted for 11 days, and then did a refeed of strict clean keto foods.

For the first time since cycling through keto for several years, I am not seeing any weight loss at all (it's been 2 weeks since I broke my fast). I am strictly staying within my macros and calorie requirements, keeping it around 1500 kcals at 5 ft 6 in and 179 lb. Even doing OMAD 2/3 x per week. Scale is not budging after the initial typical 5 lb gain post-fast. Any ideas?"
keto,How extreme (low calorie) can you be with your daily intake and still be safe?,"I've tried searching for this answer but the results are mostly about anorexia. I'm not looking to do anything unhealthy. And I'm not looking to go below a healthy weight.

I was just thinking that my body has the fat that it needs to survive and since keto is about burning fat for energy, wouldn't I be OK to take in little or no additional fat daily? I'm currently overweight. 

The daily carb rule still seems like it would be in effect.

I do assume that I need a certain amount of protein daily. Could my daily protein and a multivitamin (with a bunch of low calorie vegetables to curb hunger) be all I need to lose weight in a healthy way?

Or is there a minimum daily calories that I need, even though I'm over weight, to prevent my body from doing something negative like slowing my metabolism?"
keto,For the Jan 1 crew,"So you started 2021 motivated to kick ass, you jumped on the keto train and started to drop weight, maybe a surprising amount. You pushed through the adjustment and found yourself with no hunger... and now it's been a few weeks. Hunger is returning, weight loss has slowed or feels like it's stalled altogether. You're starting to think about quitting or maybe that keto isn't the thing so maybe you'll just take a break before you try something else... Maybe you already took a cheat day... Or two...

DON'T SABOTAGE YOURSELF

THIS IS TOTALLY NORMAL

WE ARE HERE FOR YOU

Keep going. Most people, especially if they lost a decent amount in their first weeks, hit a wall during weeks 3 and 4 as their bodies adjust. You will never lose as fast as the first couple of weeks, but you will continue to lose of you keep going.

Ask yourself, how much do you need to lose per month to make it worth it? 4 pounds (down 50 for 2021)? Set yourself a minimum and commit to keep going.

KEEP CALM AND KETO ON

if you've gotten 10 or 15% of the way to your goal weight so far, you will continue to lose weight if you stick with it. Ask questions, reassess your macros, maybe start weighing and tracking calories, but keep with it. You can do this. You're in the groove now and it's pretty easy if you stay consistent. Maybe don't weigh yourself for a few weeks :)

I have lost over 50 pounds so far, gotten below 200, fit into size 34 Levi's, all for the first time in my adult life. I'm going to keep going and I want as many of you to be with me on the journey.

Feel free to DM me or, even better, reach out in the main community support thread. Losing weight is as much a mental game as a physiological one and we are here to help.

Happy 2021 everybody :D"

keto,Inspiration Required - Keto &amp; IF,"Hello! I’ve been on the keto wagon since the start of this year and so far, lost just over 3KG. 
I have however just realised that I haven’t quite been nailing my intermittent fasting. I thought that the coffee I have first thing with a splash of cream was OK until I truly realise it’s no calories at all, zilch, nada which totally makes sense.

So I’m doing IF (16:8) with keto, tracking my macros too and doing well. The keto sticks tell me I’m in pretty consistent ketosis although I know they can be unreliable. I have all of symptoms though (funny taste, always thirsty no matter how much I drink). 

My questions I could do with some help on are;

- I know my calorie intake and macros goal but sometimes, I’m just not even hungry at dinner. Really, I don’t want to start my fasting earlier but I genuinely have no desire to cook and use the rest of my calories (around 600 remaining on a goal of 1260 a day). Is this okay? Should I always consciously use my cals even when I’m not hungry? I’m conscious that not eating from 3PM until around midday the next day is just probably not okay and I don’t want to slow my progress.

- Does anyone have any game changing keto recipes or quick snacks? Sometimes I lack a little creativity and keep churning out the same things. I did get a sandwich press today and make a fantastic toasty with my keto bread. 

Thanks for all of the inspiration on this subreddit. I have 20kg to go to loose. This week I am reintroducing workouts at the gym. Wanted to fully integrate my diet first and not go too hard all at once."

keto,Massive blood sugar drop !! Is this normal ?,"Hi Everyone !!
M 33 , 5’9” 172 lbs 
I had light chest pain for few mins in night for over a month. So, I went to cardiologist to check my heart and ecg came good. But , I was diagnosed with diabetes with 216 and h1abc 9.0 (Random test not a fasted one ) and the doctor suggested low fat diet to maintain blood glucose level but I wanted to follow low carb diet to maintain and potentially reverse diabetes 

So, I decided to do my full blood work before starting the low carb diet. I did this test on Jan 18th morning and result is 155 mg/dl , H1abc is 9.9 , insulin resistance  1.86 , insulin sensitivity 53.7 and beta cell functionality 47.5

Next day was my birthday, so I ate some sweets and small piece of cake and decided to follow keto from next day and bought a glucometer to keep track of my blood sugar levels. I was following keto diet from the next day and taking gluco meter reading after brushing on every other day. My blood sugar reduced massively than I expected which got me worried. 

Jan 20th : 207
Jan 22nd : 159
Jan 24th : 108

My fasted blood sugar level reduced over 100 pts after 4 days of keto and now I am worried if I am having other issues. Is it normal or should I stop the diet immediately.

I was looking for a doctor who approve low carb lifestyle yet I couldn’t find one."
keto,Kind of getting discouraged,I started keto on January 1st and so far I’ve only lost 6 lbs. I’m so frustrated because I keep reading about ppl that started around the same time losing like 13 and 17 lbs etc. is it normal to have only lost this much??
keto,Gave up on day 3 - looking for tips if I try again,"Hello!

I've read the faq and it has good info for sure. I'm writing just to ask for any additional tips, or to see if others have had a similar experience.

I primarily tried keto because I love rock climbing, and the one thing holding me back from climbing harder is my weight. Every time I try to restrict calories though, I hate everything and stop bothering. Long story. 

Day 1 was fine. Day 2 was basically fine, but day 3 was one of the worst days I can remember having. I woke up feeling just terrible. Dizzy, exhausted, foggy, and I kinda felt like I had taken six shots of nyquil the night before. I went to the grocery store to pick up some food with my brother, drank my ketoaid, and ate a meal. That helped with feeling foggy, but that's really it. I took more lite salt, and my brother made a keto fritatta. It was probably delicious, but every bite made me want to throw up. 

Eventually as the day went on I had some terrible...digestive...issues...I dealt with that with more electrolytes and trying to eat some food. I ate 4 grilled chicken thighs with plenty of salt, and some cheese. About an hour later, I felt what I can only describe as the most intense hunger. It felt like I hadn't eaten in days, like my entire digestive tract was empty. Except this time, it was also accompanied by terrible nausea. Queue more electrolytes, and no change. Then I started feeling a really deep depression. I've been hospitalized for depression before, so I'm familiar with that state, and I was there. It was awful. I started reading and it looks like that happens to some people.

So I gave up. And the crazy part; within minutes of eating carbs I felt like myself again. And within about an hour, I'm thinking ""hey it wasn't that bad, I can try keto again"".

I've read all about keto flu, and I thought I did what I was supposed to do to avoid it, but it was absolutely horrible. In the end, I think I could benefit from Keto, but currently I don't feel like it's worth even a few days of feeling like that."

keto,Cooking with Oil... or Sugar?,"
What's the status quo with logging oil that you cook with or put into salad dressings?  If I for instance, cooked a pork chop and used 2 tablespoons of olive oil... do you log that? Is ALL of the oil consumed, or is there a burn off factor?

Same question for sugar... if I put a 1/4 cup of sugar into a marinade that had 4 chicken breasts in it and then grilled the chicken breast.. do you log the .25 of that 1/4 per chicken breast you eat?"
keto,Success + a break+ a goal,"Hi! 
I hope everyone’s doing well❤️. I love this subreddit and the warm sense of community I get. I want to share my little journey. But before I begin I’ll share my stats:
5’4. F. CW: 160 lb

I did it for approximately 2 months. I weighed 180 and went down to 148.

I took a month break and ate like sh^t, and now I’m 158 !! But no regrets at all. My body simply couldn’t handle it &amp; I was working a lot at my job and barely had energy.

Now I’m restarting keto but with a goal that seems kind of crazy to me. I want to get down to 130 in 3 months. 

I plan to do this by reducing my calorie intake (1400) while on keto as well as working out daily. 

Having a goal set motivates me, do you guys have any tips for me? Does this seem unattainable? Either way I’m excited!!"
keto,Estimating carb content of my homemade stock,"I have a freezer full of homemade turkey stock, which I like to sip as a snack with a sprinkle of salt. The recipe contains onions and carrots, so I want to estimate the amount of sugars in each serving of stock in order to track my net carbs intake.

The recipe for stock is very simple: a turkey carcass (or 2-3 chicken carcasses), some onions, some carrots, herbs and water. This is boiled in a big pot of water for several hours and then strained and packaged up. 

Assumed net carbs in the vegetables:
Net carbs in an onion = 12g
Net carbs in a carrot = 4g

To keep things simple, I’ll assume all the sugars are extracted from the vegetables, and will also assume that 1ml stock == 1g by weight.

Last batch:
2 onions + 3 carrots = 36g net carbs
Total liquid yield = 6.5l = 6500g liquid

So each serving of stock contains 36/6500 = 0.55% net carbs

So serving of 0.5l of broth = 500g contains 2.75g net carbs

Does this seem right or am I off in some significant way?"

keto,"Broken leg, surgery, and keto....oh my","F/ 40/ SW 310.
I have been keto mostly on since 11/6/19.... I was about 50 pounds down from 310 to 260....I struggled in October of 20 and regained weight.... Then this December I broke my leg and have since needed surgery... I'm basically on bed rest for another 4+ weeks-- non weight baring, elevated as much as possible, taking meds, etc. Then it's unclear if I'll be in a walking cast or a regular cast, if I'll need rehab/ pt....
Anyway, I've restarted keto 1/1/21.  Since I actually can't exercise, can't stand on a scale, can't cook for myself, and basically have 2 pairs of capri pants that fit over my leg now, I feel so down..... Anyway, the whole thing is getting to me. My husband and family have been great about making and serving me keto food, but I'm not able to track actual measurements without being a huge inconvenience to those already helping me so much.
Anyway, looking for ideas to judge any success or to help with bordem/ pity cravings. ... It's not even about wanting non- keto foods, I think it's about not over indulging."
keto,Yet another keto success story w/ pictures,"Hey everyone! I've been doing low-carb, keto, zc etc. for about 5 years now. This is a part of my crazy life story. Im going into some personal deetz now so please be respectful.
Keto for me started when I was sick and dying at the age of 17. I was morbidly obese at a weight of 350 lbs, on what seemed like every drug under the sun, couldn't function in school, and was suffering from serious physical and mental ailments.  My doctor had told me that I was the youngest person he'd ever have to put on heart medication and I didn't care. At the time I just wanted it to end. I only saw hopelessness. The extent of my keto knowledge at the time came from a family member that had lost some weight doing Atkins. I had heard that carbs were bad so I initially cut them out completely and ate just chicken breast for two months. I hit the gym constantly during that time and I lost 80 lbs. I was driven at the time by a sort of self rage that came from realizing what my body had become. Every time I felt pain or strange heart palpitations during my workouts I would repeat the mantra ""pain is just a sensation"" I realized that I didn't care weather these heart palpitations turned into a heart attack because I had nothing left to lose. That mentality gave me the ability to make the conscious choice to ignore the pain. If i dropped my goal of go back to being practically dead anyway. I've since had a bunch of people say ""you could've lost the weight more slowly, what you did was dangerous, you shouldn't have done that"". To those people i say fuck off. If you want to take things slowly and pitter patter to your goal then do it. That wasn't an option in my mind.

Less than a year after starting keto I was over 100lbs lighter. I raised several thousand dollars for cancer and rode a bicycle 4600 miles throughout the usa for the cause. When I was satisfied that my physical body had recovered from the damage that came from listening to modern medical wisdom I started trying to recover from my straight 'F' brain. 
I worked tirelessly reading books on math and classical literature. I felt sick that I had missed so much of this during highschool. I cried again and again at the fact that I had lost so much time in my life but kept pushing forward because I still had the rest I needed to live correctly.
It's taken years to recover from the mental damage of the lifestyle i was living for a decade and a half of my childhood. I had to struggle with the realization that one of the few things that keto and carnivore didn't fix in my mind was the fact that i am a transgender woman so i buckled down and dealed with that like like the fighter I am. I'm now 22 and have not gotten below a 'B' since starting my major in Computer Science at a four year university. I'm an admin in our Cyber Operations club and am the team captain for the National Collegate Cyber Defense Championship. I take on as much work as I can handle and take care of my body. I break keto with a carb day every one to three months because i find that i benefit from that but am otherwise pretty strict.

Keto and carnivore saved my life."
keto,Carnivore - Keto,"So just FYI, I’m 30 years old. 6’6. Was 270 lbs and after doing carnivore as the subs on here suggest lost 12 lbs or so only in 3 mo’s. 

However, since I added veggies which is just this month of January. So protein, fat, veggies mg weight loss + positives have been phenomenal. Went from 258 on carnivore to 240 lbs and with much more added energy, great sleep, less anxiety, etc. I mean generally speaking I’ll have a salad with bacon 4-5 times a week and some baby carrots or mushrooms throughout the week as a snack. 

My question is: I was really brainwashed by the carnivore community that any veggies are unnatural and wrong. Don’t get it wrong I love Meat and it’s my primary go to but can anyone help me explain to others or even myself WHY VEGGIES/PLANTS are good for your body and not unnatural like carnivore suggests ? 

I’m not informed enough outside of my own success on keto va. Carnivore. But I’d love some guidance as I started carnivore do to many ppl in my friend/life group doing it and looking down on anyone trying veggies etc as unnatural. Would anyone be willing to help me with a response outside of my own immediate benefits? 

Sorry for the essay thanks for your time."
keto,How does the hormonal part work with keto?,"I read some posts on reddit's and comments too, that mentioned how the fat loss when in ketosis is a hormonal response and it releases stored chemicals in the fat. 

So I'm wondering what that means in real life. Does it account for bad body odor? Does it mean you scientifically enter a kind of detox? 

When does this purge end (if ever), and does it correlate with the quality of food you eat? I..e. if I was formerly eating high carbohydrate fuel, would this be a component of chemicals released? 

I realise my questions are messy but I'm really interested in learning. Also, as a woman, I am interested in how the menstrual lead up shifts over time on keto. The carb cravings for me personally are becoming more manageable each cycle, though the hormonal drive to eat carbs at that time is fascinating to me."
keto,A couple questions from someone that is considering doing the keto diet.,"So, in the past couple years, I’ve gained a significant amount of weight (upwards of 50 pounds). Before that, I’d been quite active and in good, if not great, shape. (For reference, I’m M, 41, 5’11, 235). Until this recent slide, caused primarily by depression, I worked out regularly (at least 5 times a week) and was very good with my diet (no fast food, almost no sugar, etc).

One thing, however, that I’ve always been is a fairly large drinker. It’s a huge part of my job (wining/dining clients) and, frankly, I just really enjoy it. Leaving aside the health effects (which are a separate issue, not really to be discussed here), I’m wondering how and to what extent people consume alcohol on a Keto diet. Does it completely ruin it? How often and how much alcohol can you drink and still stay within the diet parameters?

Anyone else that drinks while on it, I’d love to hear your perspective.... and if anyone else knows, I’d love to hear it too.

As a separate question, I’ve been looking around a decent amount and haven’t been able to decide which Keto diet/program to follow. Any recommendations on that front would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks."
keto,Fat adaption,I have heard that when you reach a certain point in keto you become fat adapted. I was wondering if it becomes stronger over time after the fat adaption phase. I am really wondering if you can keep your fat adapted cells when you go off keto to get the best fat burning ability?
keto,I don't want to spread disinformation about things so I want to be fact checked about my diagnosed non diabetic ketoacidosis.,"F 27 137lbs 
It's a long story I'm way too tired to keep retelling so I'll copy it here from the post that caused the issue.



I was recently told to drastically lower my sugar and carb intake due to my pcos, I do not have diabetes.

I started the keto diet, and within days of starting felt very nauseous and weak, I tried to stick with it after reading about the keto flu and made sure to keep my electrolytes well replenished. But no matter how much I drank how many supplements I took I needed to pee constantly and started to vomit.

I did the keto diet years and years ago and was ok on it

I was still convinced it may be the adjustment phase so I tried to soldier on, I threw up for 3 days and lost 10 pounds, I wasn't sure if this was the supposed big drop at starting keto.

Then on day 3 I started to feel dreadful, I couldn't even sip water without puking and my partner said I was delirious, a doctor was called who asked me to come in for a blood sugar check after I mentioned that I couldn't stop peeing.

I was too ill to make it to the doctors so my mother bought her blood monitor to me, my blood sugar was 1.6, we told the doctor and an ambulance was called.

Long story short I was admitted to hospital with severe dehydration and ketoacidosis my ketones where 6.1 I think. I spent 3 days in hospital very severely ill hooked up to iv drips with magnesium, insulin, vitamin b , dextrose and other things I've forgotten.

I was strictly banned from ever attempting keto again, as there was no trace of diabetes found in all of the tests they did and they don't know why I reacted the way I did.

I've been told to go back to good old calorie counting, but the reason I went to keto was because I was told to restrict carbs because my weight is going so unbearably slowly. I weigh everything, I don't even use oil no calories are escaping me, I know I am not above the laws of thermodynamics.



Someone has told me that this Is wrong and that you do infact have to have diabetes to have ketoacidosis and I'm worried that i have it all wrong somehow? 



My head hasn't been right since this happened and I don't know why, but I dont want to spread disinformation or be confused about my diagnosis, does anyone with more medical or diet know how know much about this?

keto,Macro Calculations off?,"Hi - 

I have been planning my keto process and want to have it fully detailed out before starting to avoid any missteps and failures. I am creating my 'perfect one meal' for OMAD Keto but after using multiple keto macro calculators, I am getting different results. 

For example: I am using [https://keto-mojo.com/mymojomacros-keto-macro-calculator/](https://keto-mojo.com/mymojomacros-keto-macro-calculator/) and [https://calculo.io/keto-calculator](https://calculo.io/keto-calculator) but getting very different results. 

I am 6'3, 220 and looking to do a 20% deficit. I'd like to keep carbs under 20 grams so I have been aiming for 15. I think putting it at sedentary sets me up for success to, to shed weight. For the two calculators above, I received the following:

Keto-Mojo:

* KCAL: 1981 cal
* Carbs: 15g
* Protein: 91g
* Fat: 173g

KetoCalc:

* KCAL: 1812
* Carbs: 28g
* Protein: 136g
* Fat: 129g

What should I do? Which one should I follow? I get the carbs could throw off the KCAL but why are the other two items so off?

I am not worried about difficulty, just the perfect approach. So, i want to go into this with 'my perfect meal'. Any help appreciated!"

keto,Why the stomach issues?,"I've done Keto before, ~2 years back for a couple months. I got into the best shape in my life, brain clear as day. Then life happened and long story short I stopped. Had no problems at this time, none.

Now I've gotten back to it for ~2 months now, all seemed good so far but recently my stomach has been acting up, really bad. I do IF with Keto so the first time I eat is usually 2PM. I've been on IF for years now tho, pretty consistently.

A week ago my stomach started to hurt after the first meal, but now it hurts after every single thing I eat or drink. Some things more than others, an omellette is pretty easy for example but still causes pain. The biggest one I noticed is cherry tomatoes. I used to eat pounds of tomatoes before in ine sitting without any problems, but now if I have some my stomach starts to rumble, cramp up and eventually resulting in very unusual poops. My toilet time has been increasingly shit as well, I can't remember the last time I had a ""regular"" poop.

I drink quite a lot of water throughout the day, as much as I usually did before. I have been however drinking black coffee first thing in the morning, and letting it ""marinate"" in there until 2PM comes. I'm guessing that's the issue, but I've been doing that for three months now. These stomach issues came kind of out of the blue.

There's only one thing I've introduced to my diet that could have caused this change: a crystal sugar replacement. I got if from Amazon, 1300 5 star reviews I thought it's great, but I think that was the ""trigger"". I stopped using it for a week now but the issues still persist, if not worse. I'll stop drinking coffee for a while cus I'm guessing that's not too stomach friendly, but still, why the sudden stomach issues? It might be stress, although I don't think this is a mental issue, it's too consistent and happens even when im super chill for days.

I usually eat a ton of dairy (cheese in all shapes and forms), red meat (ground beef/pork &amp; steak), bit of chicken, moderate amount of vegetables (not leafy greens, gotta work on that) and nuts &amp; almond milk. Almond milk has been the only thing that doesn't cause a reaction at all lol.

Any ideas?"
keto,Help finding a book title,"I'm searching for a book written by a doctor published in the 70's.

I’ve been on keto for 3 months and have been seeing great progress. It’s been almost a week since I hit my goal weight and I’ve decided to stop keto in 2 days. I was wondering if I could go all out for one day? Will do so have any adverse affects on my body? I am a bit aware of gaining back 2 to 4 pounds of weight after coming out of keto.

keto,"F/24/5'3"" [186lbs &gt; 161lbs = 25lbs] (1 month) it took a lot of hard work and dedication but I did it!","This year I lost 25 lbs, intentionally and healthily with keto! I've never been able to lose weight and keep it off without some kind of unhealthy habit (like the not-eating tactic of my teens), so this is actually a big deal for me! I feel incredible most days, but overall I didn't realize the change in my look until I saw this picture - tbh the first one was unflattering to begin with, but the difference might have made me tear up a bit ? I love my body the way it is, and this has been a fun project to continue into 2021. I don't have a ""goal weight"", because personally that stresses me out, so I'm just gonna keep with these changes and let myself be surprised. ☺️

keto,Comments on my diet plan?,"First off: 32 M, 5'11, SW: 231, CW: 224, GW:185

I tried keto in the past and lost some weight but when I crossed 230 I decided to take more drastic measures. I have lost 7 pounds in 48 hours (which I know is nearly all water weight). Here's my diet plan:

1) water fast as much as possible, eat only when I feel extremely hungry, eat only prior to 6 PM

2) eat only the following foods: fish (esp salmon, herring, mackerel, trout), dark leafy greens, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, asparagus, brussels sprouts, garlic, salt, pepper, other spices, butter, olive oil, zero-sugar zero-carb salad dressing, sparkling water with natural flavor (like la croix basically). I am also taking a psyllium husk fiber supplement and multivitamin.

For example, I've eaten one meal in the last 48 hours: two pieces of salmon pan fried in butter with spices and a small salad with zero-carb zero-sugar italian dressing.

3) no calorie counting, instead just aim to eat as little as possible and only when I ""can't take it anymore"" BUT make sure to eat at least one meal every 48 hours.

I have no history of eating disorders and was a normal weight from birth though my mid 20s when I rapidly gained a lot of weight due to an incredibly stressful period of my life that now seems to be over, thank goodness! I've tried to lose this weight taking normal measures but nothing works for me, so I decided to try a more extreme approach because I cannot tolerate being this fat anymore. I look and feel bad, I am tired of my gut and double chin and love handles and my 38 waist pants were starting to feel a bit tight, and I always told myself that was the 'emergency signal.' 

I measure my BP, pulse, and weigh-in every morning. I have shitty cholesterol (high LDL, low HDL, very high triglycerides). My fasting glucose was 99 last I checked (two years ago) but my a1C seemed ok. I am almost certainly insulin resistant and I want to heal this. I have a family history of CVD and stroke, so I am extremely motivated to get this under control to the best of my ability now. My plan is to get to a healthy weight quickly while getting blood tests every month or so to make sure I'm not hurting myself. I am continuing to do my exercise program of 40-60 min of cardio 5-6 days per week, 30 mins dumbless and bodyweight exercises (pushups, leg lifts, etc) 4-5 days per week. My fear is losing too much muscle mass, hence why I am trying to eat high-protein, high omega 3 fish.

Am I insane? I am willing to literally starve (in a controlled, monitored, deliberate way) to get this fat off me."
keto,What Happens If I stop doing Keto for 2 Weeks (after 6 week fat adaption period),"I know the obvious answer to this question is ""you drop out of ketosis and go back to using sugar/carbs for energy"". So let me give some brief context:

I started Keto 3 weeks ago (having done it for 4-6 months at a time previously - I should add i'm not doing it for weightloss, purely for focus and energy)

I need to provide a stool sample and SIBO breathe test for my doctor, who has advised i stop taking probiotics, PPI (acid reflux meds), and return my diet to ""normal"" i.e. more balanced, with carbs, so the results won't be skewed for any reason.

I don't wanna stop the keto diet, but equally, I want to fix my gut. I'm planning to do Keto for about 3 weeks (so i can at least get properly fat adapted - hopefully), stop for 2, do the tests and then go back on Keto.

Is there any point getting to 6 weeks before taking 2 weeks off? Or am I better off just doing it now (or in a week's time) and getting it over with. I guess I'm wondering if there's some benefit to staying in ketosis for longer, when it comes to going back to the Keto diet after I've done some tests.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I've been doing strict keto for 3-4 weeks. I have to return to normal diet to do some gut tests; is it worth continuing to 6 weeks and then doing normal diet for two, or will it not make any difference because i'm going to have to go through 6 week adaption again anyway?  


TIA!"
keto,"Thoughts on Mayo, pickles, zero soda?","I started at 347 and am i now at 230 after gaining a bit from the holidays, my goal weight is 295 and hopefully to be there around April.. my question is iv drank zero soda this whole time and still lost weight, the last month iv really been snacking on pickles and dipping in Mayo which has one carb per serving, I’m good at portion control but my worry is that the closer I get to my goal will soda and extra salt slow my weight loss down and make it harder to reach my goal .. thanks in advance"
keto,5 days in and HR is through the roof with minimal efforts and during exercise,"I've tried keto in the past for and have had some luck dropping weight -- in 2018 I lost 61 lbs but gained 30 back when I returned to more carb-focused eating. I'm 6'5"", CW 250 with a GW of 190. I love cycling since I bought a bike in spring 2019 and have done about 5000 miles since.

Even with all that time on a bike, I can't seem to drop any weight so I decided to try keto again starting last Monday. 5 days in, I'm down 10 lbs and I know that's water, but still encouraging. I generally feel like I have plenty of energy, I try to get my electrolytes, and have been aiming for a 1000 cal deficit while not feeling hungry.

My problem is that my heart rate has been through the roof. I don't know if this is just because my body is getting used to running on fat or something else. I didn't have this problem pre-keto. As an example, I've done some bike workouts on my trainer and on Monday a 12 minute interval @ 212W let to a HR of 133 BPM. This was my first day on keto so still plenty of glycogen in the muscles. Yesterday, 4 days in, I averaged 153 BPM in a 13 minute interval at 188W. 

Do you think this is something I should be concerned about? Should I turn down the workouts for a few weeks to keep the HR in check while I get used to keto? Any thoughts or experiences are welcome. Thank you!!"

I have cut carbs almost completely out. My boyfriend has the exact same diet and he is in full ketosis. What am I doing wrong here??

They say nuts but a lot of nuts are high in carbs as well. Eggs and cheese are good but i can't base my entire diet around eggs and cheese lol

keto,Help. Keto doesn’t work?,"Hello everyone. 
First post in Reddit for me.

I’ve been doing keto ( 15g carbs or less daily) for a month now. I’ve had two cheat days which could be the reason behind not seeing much pound come off as of yet. I have not overeaten during this duration. 

I’m also someone who doesn’t drink much water or works out. I’m going to start tracking my fitness and water intake. I lately tend to under eat and I found that to be a new behavior for me. I just get way fuller off a keto diet and sometimes end the day with 500-600calories Intake which I feel like is nothing.

I initially started with herbal life @250 LB and ended @235 LB.
I started keto after as a 2 month challenge, hoping it help me create some type of self control when it came to carbs. 
I lost one pound doing keto for 30 days.

Am I doing something wrong besides not drinking enough water? Is keto not for me? 

Am I just not doing keto right? Hell. I really don’t know. 

Help please. Advise please.

keto,NSV: this morning I tried on an old and beloved dress that did not fit a month ago. I was able to zip it today.,"It looked great and I’m really happy with it.

 I have lots of older clothes that I mentally wrote off, thinking I’ll never fit in a UK size 12 pants or dresses again. I now have hope that I’d be able to wear them all sometime in the near future. I don’t know my weight but probably need to lose about 20-30lbs.

I’ve only been doing low carb for a month and change now. I didn’t go full keto - I did not eliminate the carbs in the milk I put into coffee for example. Most days I stay bellow 50-75 grams of carbs a day and 1500-1700 calories. I always had lots of veggies in my diet, but now I eat a lot more meat and eggs than I used to, and no pasta, rice, pastries, candy etc. I do have one slice of low-GI bread a week, but most of the time I’m not even craving bread that much.

“Well Naturally” chocolates are a nice replacement for sweets and they don’t feel as addictive as real choc, I can have one serving and not crave the whole package. 

I feel like I could keep this for a long while and this diet is not too restrictive or prohibitive."

I had my blood tested about a year ago and the ldl cholesterol is much higher now. The past test was mostly keto and the most recent test is carnivore with some **very rare** occasions of mushrooms and onions sometimes jalapenos and pickles.

I'm 37. I don't eat snacks or deserts. I'm told I have a genetic disposition for high cholesterol thanks to my father and his ashkenazi lineage. I've never been overweight and all my other results from my blood test are good.

I guess I'm just curious of peoples thoughts around here.

keto,"Looking for study: High Triglyceride, High LDL, vs Low Triglyceride, High LDL, vs Control","I'm about to start keto next week, and having looked as some arguments both side, and I seem to agree that high LDL isn't the end of the world if your triglycerides are low. However, looking at a response to a criticism of the Seven Countries study, Keys did an analysis where he controlled for saturated fat and saw that sugar did not correlate to higher risks of coronary disease. This seems to go against the high LDL, low triglyceride idea. However, due to the fact that he simply controlled for saturated fat, did not directly look at LDL vs triglyceride levels, I'm curious as to whether it is still possible that he is wrong about his hypothesis. 

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore I'm trying to see if anyone has found any studies concerning coronary disease between three groups, High Triglyceride, High LDL, vs Low Triglyceride, High LDL, vs a control with ""healthy"" cholesterol levels."
keto,I do keto every year Jan. through March,"I’m a pretty fit guy. I use keto to reduce my bodyfat percentage each year to under 10%. Last year, I got to 172 lbs (down from about 194) and 10.2% bodyfat by early March, so I stopped there. Later in the year, I decided to bulk to build strength, and at the end of December, I weighed in at 198.4, the heaviest I’ve ever been (the strength gains came, too, but I felt like crap being that heavy).

When I do keto, I keep my net carbs under 30g daily, with total calories between 1800 and 2000. I do fasted cardio every morning (HIIT followed by 20 mins walking at a pace that keeps my heart rate at about 125 bpm), and then I lift 4 days per week and play golf (walking) two days per week. I take one rest day with no workouts, and I allow myself one cheat day (usually same day as rest) where I relax a bit on the diet restrictions and allow myself a more normal intake of carbs.

Started keto again January 2nd, and dropped 7 lbs. within the first week or so. Since then, the lowest I’ve gotten was to 188.8 lbs. This morning, after fasted cardio, I weighed in at 189.2 lbs. I had two protein shakes (25g protein, 2g net carbs each) before golf this afternoon. That was all I ate before golf. When I weighed in after returning home from the course, I was at 190 lbs.

Looking for ideas - why does it seem like I’ve stalled? All I can come up with is possibly water retention, so I’ve ordered some Dandelion extract and decided I’ll drink more tea going forward. Anything else I might be missing? Am I just being impatient?"

I heard about all the benefits of fasting, one in particular pertaining to ketones and the nootropic effect it has on your brain. I also experiment with meditation and psychedelics. I read about the improved connectivity in your brain with mushrooms and I figured that tripping in deep ketosis would enhance the brain boosting effects
I noticed that tripping after a 3 day fast had a noticably different feeling to it. Its like it felt more natural, like everything flowed much smoother (dont know how to really describe it) in comparison to trips where I didn't fast or wasn't in ketosis. I've been thinking perhaps it's something to do with the blood-brain barrier of ketone bodies and psilocybin.

keto,[Rant] hating eggs sometimes makes me hate keto,"Ive been struggling with my weight a lot, and keto works and I love it and I feel great,  But I get food burnout pretty quickly, and after half a year I end up off the plan.  

Im not allergic to eggs and they are fine in baked goods or similar style things.  But if you can taste egg , it pushes me toward throwing up.  Its that extreme of a dislike.  

But I constantly find myself trying to sub eggs with xanthum gum, or other such things.  And it never turns out great.

I go onto recipe sites and meal guides, and eggs are everywhere.  Eggs eggs eggs.  Keto xsx recipe... Its literally just a ommelete with stuff added in being labeled as xxx.

Most people wont even notice the flavor of eggs in food because its not noticeable for them when its not that strong.  But when the flavor vehemently offends me in not afforded that luxury.

So I end up on ruts, where ill have days or weeks, where it feels like I'm eating nothing but cheese, meat, and nuts.  Because I just dont want to deal with eggs."
keto,Eating when you're not hungry just to meet your macros?,"I'm on Day 21 of keto (down 16 lbs). I normally eat brunch about 11a-12p before work and dinner about 9-10p after work. When I first started, I'd feel pretty hungry, especially when it got closer to the scheduled mealtime. Now I find that mealtime comes without the hunger pains for an hour prior. I'm still ready to eat, though. But I'm not feeling hungry between meals. 

The problem is that I often find it difficult to hit my protein macro (168) with my meals and am usually adding snacks like cheese strings or pepperoni slices at the end of the day to bump the protein up even though I don't feel like I need to eat the snack. I've looked into protein bars or shakes, but they either add too much protein (+80 when I need +15), add too many calories, or taste terrible - or all three.  If I have time to plan the entire day before brunch then I can usually add an extra egg or meat to help, but sometimes I have to improvise if my work schedule fluctuates.

I’ve lost 6 pounds already and I know that’s still great progress. But when I look at all the weight I still have to lose, I feel hopeless. I look in the mirror and don’t see a difference even though I know it takes several weeks or even months to notice a change. But it makes me want to give up and binge on all the carbs. Even though I enjoy most keto foods and don’t really miss carbs (except pasta), it’s expensive and time consuming meal planning and prepping. I try telling myself in a year from now or even like a month from now, I’ll be happy I didn’t quit. But then another part of me is like, you’re going to fail, why bother trying?

keto,Coffee creamer. Help please,"I’ve been doing keto since a little before Christmas. My biggest issue is finding a good coffee creamer. Previously, I used silk brand sweet cream. Out of the things I have tried I can tell you that heavy cream and half and half upset my stomach. Coconut based creamer tastes awful. I am currently using creamer made by super coffee and it’s decent. I will order it again if I don’t find anything better. I am aware that it is possible to drink coffee black but I have not been able to bring myself to do it. I was wondering if there was anyone out there who enjoyed a sweet, creamy cup of coffee that has found a good creamer."
keto,Over hydration?,"So I’ve been on keto about 6 days now and I’ve been making sure to get the proper electrolytes and macros but today I’m running about 120 BPM walking around at work.

keto,**NEED HELP** Keto Rash,"Hi Everyone,

New to this page. I'm a 23yr old Male. I've lost 15 pounds and been on Keto for a little over 3 weeks.

I got the Keto rash and it's now on most of the front of my stomach and under my armpits. It's not itchy or uncomfortable at all. It just looks scary.

I went to the doctor and he gave me a topical cream and a antihistamine which he said should help.

Everyone says just eat more carbs but I feel fantastic and i'm making progress. Please has anyone experienced this and what makes it go away?

Thanks in Advance.

keto,Please ya’ll—give me some hope. :),"I feel like an ass getting on here and asking, but I’m a huge fan of this forum and all the support you all give—I feel like I need some inspo.  I started keto December 15th and have lost the “water weight”—I was down 10 pounds within the first 2 1/2 weeks.  Since, I’ve been at 11 pounds down.  I’m in the belief that I’m now fat adapted; I haven’t been above 20 net carbs since day one.  My energy is mostly awesome, my waist has lost a couple inches, my mood has improved greatly, and I care about my appearance again, no matter how small the changes may be.  My SW was 260, my GW is 175.  74 pounds to go.  I DO have a smart scale and the fat percentage seems to drop by a tenth of a pound an average of every other day or so.

I’m overwhelmed with conflicting online information but I feel can tell which social media “personalities”/experts/keto “lifestylers” are genuine and which ones leave something to be desired.  Even then, though, I find it hard to find any info about the first month or two in.  I realize everyone is different, but I rarely see people saying they haven’t consistently lost weight by now.  I know there have to be others like me who had the sudden drop and then a snails pace of losing after that.  I sound like an impatient brat, stomping.  I promise that’s not my intention.

Can anyone lend their guidance or does anyone have a similar story, who stuck with it and finally saw benefits?  Or is willing to share their personal timeline or frustrations?   I’ve read and read and read and some days, the more I read and the more success stories I see, the more alone I feel.  Today is one of those days.

Thanks for your help, Reddit ketoers!"
keto,Help or Suggestions,"Hi all! Female, 41, 5’8 and weight 286. Ive been doing keto for 5 weeks, no cheating and staying strict. Staying at or under 1800 calories and 25 net carbs, protein is around 100 grams or less a day. I have lost 7 pounds so far. I get that it’s 7 pounds but with the amount of weight I need to lose, and comparing to others, I seem really slow. The majority of the weight was lost the first week and since then barely a pound. I’m just frustrated and I know I shouldn’t compare to others. I’d just like to see more of a change. Measurements haven’t changed either but I do feel less bloated and see a small difference in my face. Any thoughts or just stick with it? Thanks!"
keto,Donating Blood/Platelets on Keto,"I have an appointment tomorrow morning to donate platelets (my first time for that specifically, have donated whole blood for years), but also the first time since I've been on Keto.  In the past, whatever diet I might have been on, I just put on hold for blood donation day, opting in for two packages of oatmeal raisin cookies and one or two cranberry juices.

I did a search of this sub for the topic and found only a post or two.  Here are a few thoughts from what I found and my own knowledge of the process.

My appt is at 8am.  They always tell you to eat before you donate.  My ""normal"" IF schedule does not include food until noonish.  I'm going to have a KetoChow in the morning before I leave the house to meet the ""Eat before"" requirement.  Others mentioned electrolytes.  While I don't frequently drink ketoade, I did fill a glass of it now and am sipping today.  Thinking about taking a glass with me tomorrow as well.  For post donation snacks, I packaged up two servings of salted almonds to have with me tomorrow so I can demonstrate that I'm snacking if they push it.  

Any other thoughts or suggestions from anyone?  I'm thinking that if this goes well, I may start donating weekly, so want to set good habits for myself now and not be trying to break bad ones."
keto,Carb options for Keto,"Thanks in advance for any insight. I've been doing an 16:8 IF and healthy keto for about 2 months at this point. I've lost about 25 lbs since starting and would like to drop about 10 more. However, in the last week or so I've been getting hit with these waves of fatigue and malaise. My wife seems to think it's because I'm kind of wingin' this diet - not eating any carbs whatsoever, waiting til 1pm to eat, nor tracking any macros - just eating lean protein, veggies, salad, and anything not processed. I also take electrolyte supplements and other vitamins and make sure to stay hydrated. So with that said - has anyone else experienced this type of onset 2 months into Keto? Also, I would like to start introducing reasonable portions of keto-friendly carbs into my diet, any suggestions? Thanks again."

keto,Began dieting and working out harder again recently...,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

So covid through me off on everything and I gained like 30lbs last year without even realizing it. I started dieting and working out really hard again (lots of cardio and athletic kinds of workouts).

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I went to bed in a fasted state after a really hard cardio session and I was reading text messages on my phone thinking I was on call (I work in IT) and walking around my apartment in a dream state still completely asleep but kind of remembering it and having all kinds of crazy experiences at night.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm assuming this is a hormal response to keto and fasting while doing serios cardio but I'm wondering if any others have had experiences like this and what the actual hormonal an physical causation of this is just out of curiousity"

keto,has anyone been able to get a coherent answer from a doctor about why keto diet helps anxiety?,"I realize this is a shot in the dark because lots of doctors don't want to talk about diet at all. (My latest doctor actually dumped me as soon as I told her my main concern was improving my diet and improving my anxiety through diet....she referred me to an acupuncturist and then told me she wasn't the doctor for me, lol 🙄)

But has anyone gotten a coherent answer from a real doctor or real gastroenterologist (not an acupuncturist 🤣) about why anxiety improves on the keto diet?  Physiologically, what is happening?  

Some of the ideas I've come across when I google this are...

 * Celiac disease has anxiety as a side effect and the anxiety may be improved by elimination gluten in the diet.
 * Fructose malabsorption has anxiety as a side effect and the anxiety may be improved by minimizing fructose in the diet.
 * Occasionally I see studies that link diabetes to mental disorders - like this one, ""Insulin Resistance as a Shared Pathogenic Mechanism Between Depression and Type 2 Diabetes""
 * Gut bacteria reacts very differently to FODMAPs than other carbs, and gut bacteria can affect our moods; so moods might change when FODMAPs are reduced (keto reduces all carbs not just FODMAPs, so it can easily be a low FODMAP diet whether that's intended or not)

Hmm, what else?

I would love to take a list of ideas to my doctor and then ask him to do tests to see which ones apply to me. Because sometimes I am really struggling to stick to this keto diet even though it helps my anxiety. I keep thinking that maybe it's all in my imagination, so I go off diet again, to ""test"" it again, then I get anxiety AGAIN. Then I swear to never depart from keto again. Then a month later I doubt my test results again - because I'm both the tester and the testee, what if it was just nocebo effect, etc.  It would help so much to get the ""yes, do this diet and here's a test result that proves you should"" stamp of approval from a doctor.  Don't know if that's a pipe dream though."

I decided to start keto before 20 days, in order to cut.   
I had quit working out and I was eating rubbish and drinking alcohol for the first two months of the lockdown, and I decided to start working out and dieting again, as well as start using steroids again.   
I'm pretty experienced with working out, counting calories, dieting, etc, but I've never tried keto before.   
I decided to start cutting on a caloric deficit of 700-800 calories (eat 2000kcal per day), and also do 16:8 fasting, do a PPL routine twice per week, and also start using gear, as I said.   
Thing is, that my weight is more or less steady for 20 days now.   
What could the explanation be?  
A typical day of eating, looks pretty much like this:  
220g of whole eggs  
200g of egg whites  
25g of butter  
70g bacon

500g chicken thighs with no bone

keto,Unintended maintenance phase?,"Hey all,

I just figured I'd check in with the community to see if others have had a similar experience to mine and possibly offer some insight and helpful tips for my current predicament.  A little background:  I've been doing Keto since May and have lost 60-65lbs since that time period (a result I'm exceptionally happy with, but still plenty more to go).  However, over the last couple months, I've been quite a bit hungrier and have found myself completely stalled since November due to most likely going over my calorie goal a fair amount of days of the week.  I'm impressed I was able to stay keto through Thanksgiving and Christmas, so I can't complain too much, overall.

Fast forward to now, where I'm stalled out and seemingly in an unintended maintenance phase.  This is a bit disturbing because I start my days very well, or even just continue a bit of a fast until lunch.  However, later in the day I almost have a ravenous hunger that I cannot control and find myself snacking which ultimately leads to maintenance calories eaten, or even slightly over.  I'm still doing keto snacks like pork rinds, whisps and sugar free jerky, etc.  But I just cannot seem to control this hunger I've been experiencing.  Throughout the first 6 months, my hunger was relatively well controlled, as far as I remember.  Now, it seems like my body just wants to stay where it's at for a little while by increasing my hunger signals, despite my still trying to lose weight and stay on track.

Is this something some of you have experienced where you had a period of time where you just feel like you cannot control certain hunger urges (mostly in the evening after dinner)?  I was hoping to continue down that wonderful linear path of weight loss, but these past couple months have been a bit discouraging, to be honest.  I feel like I'm failing, even though I know that a maintenance phase isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I just wish I were TRYING to maintain instead of just doing so unintentionally... Maybe my body just needs to reach some kind of homeostasis for a bit of time for the intermittent periods of ravenous hunger to stop and for the weight to come off again.

Let me know if you have any experience with this or advice for my situation or anything else to offer.  I've seen lots of people who do try a maintenance phase in the middle of their weight loss journey, but it appears as though they were trying to maintain for a bit.  I suppose I just want to hear some encouragement that this may be a normal thing and if I keep it up, my body will be ready to lose more weight in the future.  I don't know if that's the case or not, but if I continue with a significant period of maintenance, I may have to really get back on the horse and cut calories/increase activity level even more or implement some longer fasts.  I don't want to be discouraged because I love this lifestyle and it's been so life-changing, but this recent overeating has been a bit of a wrench in the mix, to say the least.

Thanks folks!"

keto,Getting Fibre When Doing Low Carb?,"Hello,

I've recently started doing a lower carbohydrate nutrition plan, along with 16/8 IF. I'm not quite doing Keto, but I'm working my way down there. I'm currently eating about 70g/80g a day, with most my carbs coming from fruit sources or small amounts of complex carbs (steel cut oats, etc...)

It's all been going well, except I've noticed a real issue with fiber and my gut. Ever since starting low carb, I've had a lot of stomach issues. I've started supplementing with physillum husk, but I'm wondering what some good sources of low carb fiber are? It seems difficult to get the recommended 25-30g a day of fiber on a keto/low carb diet."

She puts a paw on my calf, looks up at me with determination. She walks forward, up to my thighs now... wobbles dangerously. She’s starting to wonder if this is a good idea. Nevertheless, she makes it to my side.

She squats down to lay in her cat-bread pose... and her paws fall off of me to the sides!

She’s staring at me and purring... “did I do it, mom? Is this it?”

I’m not wide enough for my cat to cuddle me properly anymore! Bless me, she’s so sweet. She’ll just have to make do with compressing my diaphragm with her fat kitty butt instead :p"

keto,That long pee,"A few years ago I did a year of keto, lost about 60lbs, shattered my goal weight, and felt amazing.  In the time since, I've stayed relatively low carb, but mostly on maintenance.  Every once in a while, the weight creeps back in and I take a few weeks/months back in strict keto to get back to where I want to be.  

Every time I fall back on line, I love that morning feeling... Waking up with a taste in my mouth that isn't ""bad"" but is uniquely ""keto""

And then the morning pee.  The most telltale sign for me today my body has reached ketosis is that morning pee that seems to go on forever as my body has decided to start shedding the excess water weight no longer needed for glycogen.

I know it's a dumb thing, but all that extra time peeing feels like a ""welcome home"" for my body."

keto,Make my cravings go away!,"I’ve been on keto for almost a month now. I was on it for 5 days before I broke it (it was my birthday and the old women in my family wouldn’t let me leave until I ate one piece). Breaking keto made me feel really sick for about 3 days (now about 3 weeks later) and since then I don’t have that “don’t need much sleep, don’t have cravings” vibe like I have always had when I did keto. 

Is there something I can do -like add to my diet- to make these beastly fast food cravings go away? I think about fast food way more then I did before I started. Is this maybe a sign that my body needs more fat? Does it take longer for your body to adjust after abruptly starting keto?"

keto,Thyroid Confusion,"Confused with Thyroid

So I’ve been low-carb for about 7 months and am now basically ketovore (I have some avocado and olives sometimes. My diet is mostly steak, egg yolks, fish and a lot of butter.

T4: .65 (from .45)
TSH: .145 
T3: 2.9 (from 2.6)

My T3 is great and T4 improved from last month, but the T4 is a little low. 

Last month I realIzed I was severely under eating (probably a 500 calorie deficit per day) and I’ve been now eating a 500 calorie surplus at least each day. I also have good iron, copper, zinc, iodine, vitamin d and selenium levels. 

Honestly, my skin has cleared up. My energy is excellent through the day. No gas or bloating. Not depressed or anxious like I used to be or have any brain fog. I’ve put on healthy weight and am not chubby or anything.

My functional doc is having me try some l-tyrosine. At this point I have no idea what my thyroid wants! Maybe just need to continue to keep up the higher calorie intake? Or try some carb cycling?"
keto,Onederland,"Not sure what I weighed in August 2018. Probably about 350 lbs. Size 50 pants, 3xl shirts. Weighing would have depressed me, so I had no scale, and I also did dirty keto.
5 months later joined a gym. Finally one year plus in I weighed myself at 224. I'm 6'2"", Got down to 204 by February 2020.
Then my gym shut down, my kids and I got sent home from school and the office respectively.
They wanted pizza, and I stressed as all get out, decided I would have 1 slice, which turned into 6. 5 months of binging later, was back in size 38 pants and extra large shirts, after starting the pandemic in size 34 and large. August my office opened up part way making us do 2 days a week inside. And, basically none of my work pants fit except for one pair.
 I made a commitment to myself to get back, and I did. Walking instead of the gym, strict ""dirty keto"" just monitoring carbs.

I decided to go hardcore, was up to 25,000 steps some days and if I got to where I was in February by New Years, I would reward myself with some forbidden junk food on New Years day. Weighed
for the first time in 10 months on New Years. 205. Yes, I did it.

But I decided to forgo the junk food reward. That reward of pizza set me back 5 months. Like an alcoholic and booze, I can't just cheat a little.
So over the past 19 days I have been keeping it going and got a woosh. 199.6.

Everybody's relationship to food is different. Some people can cheat one day or one meal now and then and get back on track.
I can't. So I won't. If you are new on this journey and your relationship with carbs is like mine. Heed my advice. I would have rather have been in onederland in March than to give in to junk food. 

That's my story."

I started at 135kg, so almost 10% of my body weight. However I still feel fat of course and I'm only slightly starting to see differences in the mirror.

Yesterday was my first day in work since Dec 23rd and so far 4-5 people have mentioned how I look thinner already! Such a good feeling, especially those times when it's the other person initiating the conversation. My work hi-vis jacket was tight when I started keto, now I feel plenty of room in it. I'm pulling my belt a couple of holes tighter than I was at the start.

Despite not thinking I can see much difference in the mirror, my gf showed me some photos we took when I started keto and all I could think was ""fucking hell"", so I am noticing I look different, I just don't realise as it's gradual and I see myself in the mirror every day. I can't imagine how good it's gonna feel looking back at that photo of me at start weight when I'm down to a healthy weight and shape.

Certainly finding it easy to keep motivated - I think the best part is when discussing the fact I'm losing all this weight and telling people that I had a BIG fry up almost every day that I was off work!"

keto,Discouraged,"I have lost 10ish pounds in a month, 6 in the first week. On the bright side I am not having any trouble sticking to the diet and do feel good mentally and physically. I'm trying to lose baby weight and I just thought it would come off faster. The other part that sucks is I have a two yr old and a partner who won't do keto, so I get to make 3 different meals for dinner every night. Meh."
keto,It happens to many of us,"Yup. I put back on 20#. A new job in September and the holidays combined to cause complacency. I was eating a lot of nuts and keto type snacks. Never did I go full blown back to the carbs.

I have already dropped 5 of it in the last couple weeks. Now I am back to real keto (not tracking, just hyper aware of what I eat) and 18:6 intermittent fasting. And nut consumption is down 90%. Keto snacks down significantly, as well.

If you fell off a bit, don't be too discouraged. It happens to many of us. Just try to gain control of the situation before it gets too far along.

keto,Any risk associated with 'long term keto'?,"Hey all,

Started keto about a month and a half ago after 28 years of really bad anxiety, depression and the odd Grand Mal Seizures thrown in for good measure.

Within 8 days I felt reborn. I barely even identify with the old me now. Heck I work out daily and sleep properly now (was a mad insomniac). Even my tinea versicolor has disappeared for the first time in 5 years! Ya boi sun bathed this summer for once! No shame, no Michael Jackson 

Think cutting the sugar and running on ketones is really working for me and have ZERO desire to go back to how I was. 

QUESTION(s) Are there any risks associated with sticking with ketosis for life? 
Do I need to break the diet from time to time to replenish glycogen levels in muscles?
What supplements would be essential?
Will I make myself gluten intolerant?"
keto,My mum finally wants to give keto a go!,"So my mum is a classic yo-yo dieter. She’s now 61 and pushing a bmi of 40. I’m an auxiliary nurse and have worked with people who have dementia, diabetes, osteoarthrits, and many many more aged illnesses. I feel she’s only a few years from all that, I’ve seen the proof myself. I have been on keto since the beginning of November last year. I have lost almost 20 pounds now, I’m 25 away from my goal weight. It’s not just the weightloss, it’s the feeling of wellbeing, brighter skin and an improvement on my autoimmune issues. She’s definitely a convert. She wants me to give her recipes and a a sort of meal plan. I finally convinced her when I made a selection of baked goods to show her that you can still have something sweet and familiar but still get benefits from desserts. 

Now it’s the rest of the family 😂"
keto,Bone broth,"Has anybody here tried kettle and fire? I ordered 13 bottles and just tried the chicken and mushroom and both was it awful. On top of the sour from powder taste, I’ve had pretty aggressive, and I’m sorry for the crudeness, diarrhea ALL DAY. If any of you have tried this company can you share your experiences with the product. 

I did speak to them and they refunded me in full except for $1.25 because they have a maximum refund limit, but they also let me keep the broths that I’ll be giving away to friends to try. I was curious if this was an issue with my GI or if it may be the product before I give it away and get other people sick. Hopefully your experience will help make that determination. Thank you for your help. 

I should mention I’ve been cutting my own whole chickens for bone broth for about a month now so I have a little bit of experience hahaha not much"
keto,Keto and Tattoos: Advice Needed!,"Okay, I have a question for those who have had tattoo work done while in ketosis and advice, tips, or experience would be greatly appreciated!

I'm currently working on a very large large piece (traditional irezumi sleeve + chest panel) and I'm about 13 hours into a \~50 hour tattoo. My first session on this piece I sat for 7 hours and sat for 6 hours on my second session. Anyone who has sat for long sessions knows the constant flow of adrenaline is hard work for your body and you'll have cold sweats, shakes, increased urination, etc. From what I understand, this is your body mass converting glucose to produce more adrenaline which is why people always suggesting eating a large meal before a session and having plenty of snacks on hand.  I've never been tattooed while doing keto and lots of carbs/sugars have been my best friend to sit through those long sessions. 

My question is for anyone who has had a 4+ hour tattoo worked on while in ketosis (or any tattoo). How did your body respond without the use of carbs or sugars? Were you able to sit longer, manage pain better, lessen symptoms of an adrenaline dump? Let me know your experience! Any advice or perspective would be helpful!"
keto,Advice for Wife (Almost have her roped in...),"So, I've been (mostly) keto for the last 2 years and have had really good luck with it.  My wife suffers from all the ailments that keto directly addresses:  lack of energy, extra weight, cognitive fogginess, lack of success on diets)...

However, the way I do keto is relatively close to meat-based.  Occasionally, I'll eat something green or otherwise colored, but generally I eat mostly meat.  It works for me, and I like it.

She, on the other hand, will eat meat occasionally, or if I make it for her, but she would mostly choose otherwise.

With keto, I'm well versed in some of the veggies...avocados for fat, cruciferous veggies, yadda yadda.

But, I was hoping some folk could lend some advice and/or favorite meals, so I could really rope her in.  Hell, I'll even cook the meals until she seems some progress.  

Anyway, thanks!"
keto,You hit your target weight: now what?,"I've had this question since my wife and and I started on keto. Because on our previous eating habits we were neither losing nor gaining weight, I have assumed that we could go back to that and maintain our weight without gaining any back. Before we were eating pretty balanced and healthy, though my portion sizes were probably a bit too big and I did have an average of two beers a day, but I wasn't gaining any weight. I was 86kg, am down to 81, and target is 76. 

Once I hit my target weight can I go back to eating a mostly healthy and balanced diet or do I have to maintain the keto diet to keep my progress?

Would love to hear from some people that have done it and how they kept their progress."

keto,Hey ketofam. I have good news for Eastern Europeans but not only.. Cheapest flour replacement,"Flaxseeds.   

In Eastern Europe they are very often encountered, i am not sure about the western world, but you might have them.   

Almound/coconut flour are very expensive here.  

A bag of 125g of flaxseeds costs... 0.35€ in my country.   
(Or ~1.79€ for 1 kg).     

You need to grind them with a coffee grinder or something and that's it.  
   
So far i made with it shawarma (without fries, and homemade mayo), pizza (you know, homemade pizza never has that soft fluffy dough when you don't have a nice oven, right? With flax flour it's soft and fluffy), i also made chicken wraps, and blini (some sort of pancakes) with salmon.   

People also make actual bread from it.   

I suggest you to google ""flaxseeds keto"" for more information and stuff.   

I just wanted to share this nice trick with you, fine people.   

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk"
keto,Question about blood work,Hey guys. Been eating keto for a little over a year now and want to get blood work done to check general internal health as so many have done and recommend.

keto,Killer Creamery Net Carb Claim,"Has anyone noticed that the front of Killer Creamery’s pints say 2 net carbs per serving, but when you look closer at their nutritional info on their website there’s a page showing an * saying *average per serving? I find that very misleading since looking at the vanilla flavor (link below) it shows carbs are 12, fiber is 3 and erythritol is 3 per serving.  When I do the math that comes out to 6 net carbs. I don’t know how they calculate because none of the flavors I looked at came to less than 5 net carbs per serving. I don’t know where they get that 2 net carbs is an average per serving. Am I missing something?

keto,Confused about net carbs,"Hi guys!

I recently bought a keto snack bar (goodgood krunchy keto salted caramel) and on the label it says 2.5g net carbs, with the following macros:

Carbs - 7g
Of which sugars - 2g
Of which polyols- 4.5g
Fiber - 9.5g

How are they getting to 2.5 net carbs? 

Thanks!"
keto,Finally got the scale to go back down instead of up,"I had been experiencing bloating recently and the scale numbers kept increasing after I had lost 13lbs. I started tracking my net carbs, understanding how to calculate net carbs, and laying off of baking keto desserts. I also decreased my intake of eating whole avocados and now I’ll use a 1/4 when I want it. Tracking surely helped me to see I wasn’t meeting my protein goal and to make sure I’m at a caloric deficit. I have been using Isopure Keto protein powder with almond milk to increase my protein intake. 
My bloating is gone but now I have a new struggle.. sticking with IF. I had no problem doing it early on but now I’m so hungry that it’s hard to make it through the full 16 hours so usually give in a drink my protein shake. I know IF isn’t really important but I do it to help restrict some calorie intake. I also noticed my appetite is increasing recently like I’m still hungry after I eat which is weird because when I was in ketosis before I wasn’t too hungry. I think it’s either one of two things: Pms symptoms or I could be pregnant. Or could it be anything else if you experienced this as well? Will hit 2 months on keto this Saturday."
keto,Caffeine Tolerance on Keto,"Anyone else notice a pretty significant change once starting keto in regards to caffeine consumption?

I know the jitters are most def the caffeine, but I even get a little lightheaded which makes me panicky! 

Maybe lack of carbs makes it metabolize differently? Am I reaching here lol.

I had my usual caffeine amount yesterday 200mg + since I first started back on keto (recently). Major headache, irritable and downright panicked and anxious allllll day."

keto,I Jusy Ate a Huge Piece of Cheesecake and I Regret It,"I've been doing keto on and off for years to maintain a healthy body weight, and today I failed. My coworker had brought in a huge triple layered vanilla cheesecake and set it in the break room for anyone to have. My absolute favorite dessert, the bane of my whole life when it comes to weight loss and healthy food management... The dreaded vanilla cheesecake.

While everyone was busy I went in there and cut myself a huge slice. The whole time I knew it was a bad idea, but it was like a ghost possessing me and making me do it anyways. 

You wanna know the kicker? It wasn't even THAT good. The first bite was glorious, but after that? Guilt. Every bite was just guilt and feeling horrible that it wasn't as good as I'd imagined but I ate the whole slice anyways.

So here I am, at my work desk with an upset stomach and a brain full of guilty conscience. My journey starts again effective immediately, just take it from me: it's not worth it. Stick to your journey and see it through.

Good luck!"
keto,"Keto, shark week, and the pill",Can anyone tell me if keto caused any problems with their cycle especially on birth control? I started keto right after Christmas and I was due for a placebo week the week after and haven’t stopped spotting since then. It’s not a full blown period it’s just spotting and clotting when I wipe. I’m on this combo pill to control my bleeding because I bled too much prior. Last month I wasn’t taking my pill at the same time everyday and I was extremely stressed so these past few weeks I’ve decided to change that and be more consistent but no change. Is keto to blame?
keto,Any tips for managing hunger pangs?,"Hello!   


Been Keto-ing since New Year, really enjoying it and having success with it so far.   


One issue I'm dealing with is hunger pangs. I don't mean a feeling of snackishness or that pretend hunger when bored, I'm talking proper physical hunger - growling stomach with a dip in my ability to function.   


I'm supplementing electrolytes, sticking within my macros and stick close to my calories as laid out in carb manager. I'm not starving myself, so I know it's probably a case of  my body *expecting* more food and making a fuss rather than a genuine need. I spent a long time eating far more than I needed so my body is probably wondering where the extra snacks and double dinner has gone.  


I'm trying to ignore it in the hopes it will go away but it's making me less productive at work and unable to relax when I'm off. It's even making it hard to sleep!   


If anyone has any tips that helped them keep hunger at bay, while their body got used to eating like a normal person and not like a mountain giant, I'd really love to hear them!"

keto,20g of Carbs vs 5% of caloric intake?,"Hey y'all, first time poster here.

I've been on and off keto a few times (I pulled the dumb move of hitting my goal weight and then thinking I can eat junk again without consequence.) and have always asked myself a question I can never answer.

Starting out, I read on many articles and forums that you can only have 20 net carbs a day, or you can have net carbs equal to 5% of your daily caloric intake. For me, that's 75, which is a huge difference.

Which is it? One has way less carbs than the other."

Then she put her goal weight on a Keto calculator, got her macros, installed a food tracking app... goodbye to carbs, cold turkey!

That was around two years ago. Her skin is now glowy and clear, she doesn't have facial hair anymore, even overcame her depressive episodes. She also texted me to tell me that she's 3 months pregnant! She was able to drop her birth control last summer and apparently agreed to have a baby with her mans.

keto,100bs lost but I need help...,"SW:277 CW:177  32yo 6' Female. Stoked on the weight loss and the bizarre lack of hunger but I keep having bouts of scurvy even with oral vitamin c supplementation. I eat a diverse diet of fresh meat, dairy, leafy greens, and vegetables both cooked and raw. I aim for 1600 calories, roughly 120 grams of protein 20-30g carbs

 I did not supplement sodium, potassium and mag for the first 6 months which left me often dehydrated and the scurvy was at its worse. Since drinking the salts the symptoms are mostly resolved but still having difficulty healing cuts and burns.

Ive read that ""extreme"" weight loss can cause this, as fat is used to a degree to store vitamins and minerals. Also that the diuretic effect of ketosis might mean that my supplements arent ""sticking"". My doctor doesnt seem concerned, and is just happy im not prediabetic anymore. He just offers to write scripts for high dose vitamin c pills. Im sick of this, anyone have any input?"

I get a decent ammount of electrolytes and i have checked mineral status wich was fine according to doc :/ ?!!!

Could it be sodium overload then ?

keto,Electrolytes/fatigue question,"This is my third go 'round with keto (about 3 weeks now) and I'm just so damn tired all the time. I'm tracking my electrolytes and generally getting the minimum suggested in the FAQ, but I know the amount needed can vary per individual.

My question is -- is there a specific electrolyte I should be upping to combat this incessant fatigue? Or should I just be taking more of all of them? (Currently aiming for 5000mg salt/2000-3000mg potassium, and 500mg magnesium.)

I'm not having any other keto flu symptoms -- no headaches, no cramps, no heart palpitations, etc. I haven't been exercising lately. I work at a computer all day but I do make sure to take breaks and walk around and look away from the screen. I drink 1-2 cups of coffee 4-5 days a week, and eat mostly whole foods (meat, veggies, cheese, eggs, nuts) with the occasional bit of Halo Top, Jell-o, or single glass of red wine at night. My carbs are always under 25g, almost always under 20.

I'm also waking up repeatedly throughout the night, but even if I nap during the day, the fatigue doesn't go away. 

Also, I've been taking 400mg of magnesium citrate at night since I know it can make you sleepy, but would it be better to take it in the morning?

Apologies if I missed something obvious. I re-read the FAQ and did a search through old posts, but I'm so freaking tired it's entirely possible I overlooked something. Thanks, everyone!"

keto,“On this journey I have found my own inner strength”,"Letter From my Beloved Wife

&amp;#x200B;

I’m Cris Oliver a 37-year old stay-at-home mom from Pennsylvania  I’ve lost 33 lbs ( 15 kg) with keto since September 2019 and wanted to share my story with you. Thank you so much for your time!

&amp;#x200B;

My entire life I hated my body. I searched for ways to change it and to hide it, all along not realizing that the only way I was ever going to be happy is if I loved it. As I ventured along my weight-loss journey I began thinking about my daughters  and how ashamed they must be of their “fat” mom.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed them looking up to me… figuring out how they should feel about their bodies… wondering what value they added to the world… and basing that conclusion on how I felt about my body. It hit me like a ton of bricks. The problem wasn’t with my body… it was my poor self esteem and lack of self confidence. There’s nothing shameful about the size of a body. I knew losing the weight without loving myself would never be the answer. So, I ended the war with my body.

&amp;#x200B;

I concentrated on creating sustainable, easily maintained habits. Keto fit so naturally into my lifestyle. Unlike other low-carb diets I felt satisfied and the cravings only returned when I fell off track.

I adjusted this way of eating as I went and made it work for me and my family. When tracking macros became overwhelming, I switched to lazy keto paired with intuitive eating. Through that combination I was able to end my destructive habit of binge eating and develop a healthy relationship with food.

&amp;#x200B;

When I began this journey on Sept 12, 2019, I would have told you that losing 33 lbs ( 15kg) and 3 pant sizes with keto would be my greatest achievement. I would have been wrong. On this journey, I have found my own inner strength. I have overcome debilitating anxiety and severe mood swings. I’ve discovered a passion for hiking and exploring. I have taken my life back.

I am not chasing a fad diet nor am I on a mission to have a six pack. I am on a journey to fuel my body with healthy foods and to move it in ways that make me feel genuinely happy and comfortable in my own skin. And to show my girls that their worth in this world will never be defined by the size of their body.

keto,Performance Specs?,"Anyone have any recommendations for how to be on Keto while your body is working pretty hard pretty frequently? I haven’t been on keto in a while, but the last time I stopped it was simply because I didn’t have enough energy - I was on it for a couple months but just couldn’t really perform in sports so called it for a while. However, I found that I really improved my body composition while I was on keto which was I really liked! 

Last time, I was basically just on an extremely high protein keto diet in order to lose the stuff I didn’t need but keep the muscle. It seemed to work except for the pretty severe exhaustion. I also found myself eating almost twice as much food as I normally would as I was just tired all the time. I was also using a ton of caffeine for some sort of boost. 

Does anyone have any foods that I could eat on keto that could give me a lot of energy? I feel like the lack of carbs really set me back and was wondering if there was any sort of replacement. 

For reference I’m mostly climbing, using keto to cut down on that body fat (which isn’t super high already, but every little bit of weight counts!). I tried keto as I heard a lot of good things from other people in the climbing community and it seemed to help my performance but only after I was finished with the diet..."
keto,No weight loss??,"So I've been doing keto for 3 weeks and I have not lost more than a pound or two. To put it in perspective, I am a 5'10 F/20/321lbs. I have well over 100 pounds to lose. I make sure I am at a calorie deficit every day. I am also doing fasting with keto. I am really confused as to why I'm not seeing more of a difference. Could I be doing something wrong? I've done keto before and lost quite a bit of weight, so I'm not exactly new at this. I just know from experience that I usually lose a lot of weight from keto, especially when I just start out. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions?"
keto,"Can't explain: Any amount of protein knocks me out of ketosis, why?","I'm starting to get so frustrated. I can't explain this.

Been doing keto pretty hardcore for about a month now. Started checking my ketones with a blood ketone reader last week, and... I'm just so surprised, perplexed, and frustrated.

I've been eating under 10g carbs a day, and most days probably under 5. I'm keeping it so strict because I'm trying to find relief from an autoimmune condition that seems to affect my gut and causes me anxiety, depression, brain fog, and lethargy. I'm not trying to lose weight, so I've been keeping my fat intake high and consistent, shooting for 200g or above.

Eating basically no carbs has done great things for the brain fog and the anxiety. But the lethargy and depression are still there. Unless I eat straight fat and no protein for 24 hours, I'm still fatigued and depressed.

I know the ketone reader I bought is more or less accurate because my roommates, who are doing keto with me (and eating up to 30 g carbs a day i might add) use it and are full on it ketosis, consistently past 2.0 nmol/l, (both of them eating plenty of protein every day). However, when I use it to test myself, I've never been deeper than 2.0 nmol/l, and, like I said, thats ONLY after eating straight fat for over 24 hours (which also upsets my stomach and gives me the runs).

To knock myself out of ketosis, all I have to do is eat literally just 20g protein, and an hour later my ketones are back down to 0.3 nmol/l and I feel just super low energy again and depressed. 

I've read posts online of people who eat up to 200g protein a day and still have blood ketone levels above 2.0 nmol/l. I know what some of you are going to say, that the levels don't actually matter, it's how you feel my wellbeing/energy does go hand in hand with my blood ketone levels.

I know excess protein convert into carbs via gluconeogenesis, but I thought that's really only in the absence of carbs and fats? For me, any protein takes me out of ketosis. It's as if, in the absence of carbs, my body prioritizes protein instead of fat.

Does anyone have any experience with this type of thing? I can't find any reports that are similar, and I'm just so confused.

Any input helps. Thanks."
keto,2 weeks in on my second Keto journey and I have GERD again.,"This is my second attempt at keto in two years. I lost 2st back in 2019 but I woke one morning with crippling tummy pains and burning waves of agony. Doc said it was GERD. I kept a food diary for a week, but it didn't seem to matter what I ate after that, it was hell. The medication didn't work, and I tried every old wives take and Google advice I could find. I slowly added low carbs back in to my diet and after 6 weeks or so, I had less acid reflux and the pain faded.

I was determined to give it another shot again after lockdown piled on a few pounds. So I set a NY resolution to start up again. 15/01 I woke up in agony, all over again. 2 weeks in this time, and not 14 months. 

I stick close to my macros, but often go over on protein. I eat: bacon, chicken, salmon, pork, venison, brassica, avacado, courgette, salad, eggs, cheese and cream. I also eat fat-head bread once or twice a week. 


Am I just not built for Keto? I have seen so much positivity in Keto curing GERD, yet here I am. Keto has become a lifestyle for me now, I don't know what else to do."

Cholesterol is on watch but not crazy high. BMI about to get to overweight range it’s 30.2 currently. Ideal weight chart says I should 153 but that doesn’t seem reasonable. 175 will be my ideal and I’ll let blood work and heart health decide if I need to go lower. Thinking about getting a Peloton or a treadmill. 

Side note journey - I was 268 in April of 2019 and got down to 230 and then covid ate my way to 261 in 5 months. Started back in August and made changes to do keto and watch calories, incorporate berries and more vegetables, exercise 4 days a week."
keto,Does anyone use cycling or any other tips to manage plateaus with keto or IF?,"I've  followed the keto diet on and off for the past several years, along  with intermittent fasting for 16-18 hours per day.

keto,"Confused about Calories, Carbs and Protein","I started Saxenda today and my doc has just started me on this diet.  She wants me on like 2300 cal (or less), &lt;50g carbs to achieve ketosis.

Problem is, the articles I've been reading about Keto says I should eat .7-.9g of protein per pound I weigh...  I'm a BIG dude.  So my math says I should be eating between 325-420g of protein a day.  How the hell do I get that kind of protein without breaking the calorie bank?  My Carb Manager app won't even allow me to enter those numbers, the sliding scale pulls the carbs up too far. 

I honestly believe I could eat 3,000-3,200 calories a day and still lose weight (at this point), scaling back as I lose.   I'm finally ready to do this, but doggone-it, it has to be somewhat realistic, or I'll fall off the train and eat my subdivision."

keto,NSV: Keto horror story (ordered boneless wings by accident),"So I like to treat myself at times over the to some wings from Bdubs. I always order 20 so i can have some the next day. I was feeling extra lazy so I got it on door dash. Shit took like 2 hours to get here but I was so excited for my bro down with some wings on a Saturday night. 

To my utter horror, as I opened up my wing boxes I see that I accidentally ordered boneless wings. Fried and battered in carb death. I gasped at the sight and felt the blood drain from my face. I was already $30 in, and there is one thing that I hate more than wasting food, and that is wasting money. As I sat there trying to figure out what to do, I decided that I will just have an unplanned cheat day. 

As I took a bite into my lukewarm, soggy, garlic Parmesan carb devil, the holy Keto spirit touched my soul and said “this is not worth it” and I agreed. 

So, I took off all the breading and ate what I could. It was a sad meal and definitely not worth $30 but I found what I hate more than wasting food and money, and that is ruining progress."

I have lots to lose so its ok if I eat under my calorie target, sometimes by 4-500 because my body is smart enough to tap into the fat on my arse for energy. 

Its ok if I do this often as long as I get my protein and feel ok.

keto,Keto diet increases my HRV by 29% according to Whoop,"I use a Whoop band to track sleep and HRV (heart rate variability). For those who don’t know, HRV is basically an indication of how well your parasympathetic nervous system can activate. 

I have a lot of trouble getting my parasympathetic nervous system to come online for many reasons. Therefore, my HRV is perpetually low, like anywhere from 5-30. And I notice that I feel like crap when it’s low. 

This morning, I opened my whoop app and saw the message linked below.

Apparently, when I follow a (self-reported) keto diet, my HRV increases by 29%. This is huge for me. I also know there may be mitigating factors. But the data I get from this band generally confirms my suspicions, so I believe it in this case.

Also, I’d like to say a big “I told you so” to my husband who doesn’t believe eating a low carb diet is healthy for me and my unique biology.

keto,Three Weeks on Keto &amp; I Finally have a Healthy Relationship with Food (Progress Pic),"(24F 5’6 SW: 142 CW:130) So, basically what the title says. I’m one of the stereotypical girls who danced her whole life &amp; developed body dysmorphia &amp; a terrible relationship with food as a result of spending hours in front of a mirror each day. I started Keto three weeks ago because I was tired of having breakdowns before leaving the house because none of my clothes fit right, avoiding looking in the mirror, dreading getting ready for work, etc. I would skip meals then binge right before I went to sleep. I would go two days without eating only to gorge myself on everything in sight. The worst thing for me though we’re the cravings. I would get cravings for horrible junk food and would not be able to get them out of my head until I indulged. I’ve always struggled with anxiety but this past year I fell into a depression because I felt like there was just nothing in my life I could control. Since starting Keto, I for the first time, look at food as fuel. I want to finish my plate because I know it’ll help keep my full until my next meal. I can eat until being full without feeling guilty and i’m still LOSING weight. I didn’t start Keto to help with my depression but the changes in my mental health in just three weeks have been insane. Literally, for the first time in over a year I’m excited to get up every morning (honestly mostly because it feels like my body is literally changing over night) I check this subreddit every morning to keep me motivated and I want to thank you guys so much I really feel like a new, happier, healthier person.

keto,Anyone ever have extra issues coming back from a break?,"So I’ll preface this with noting I’m getting in contact with a doctor, but it’s COVID time and that makes it harder. 

I started in on keto a few times before but in January of 2020 I finally actually stuck with it and I’ve lost about 70 lbs. I originally gave myself a dedicated cheat once I got to that goal but in the end wound up just taking about 10 days off during the holidays. To my own surprise, I managed to stick with it again after the 26th of December with no major issues, but now I’m having some issues, namely what appears to be a potassium deficiency. 

Throughout the day and during exercise, I don’t have many issues but at night I’m having an awful time sleeping. Most notably I’ve had a few nights where I wake up overheating with my heart racing. I suspect the potassium deficiency because on a whim I made some ketoade one night thinking I was just dehydrated but left out potassium and nothing changed - but a second drink with added potassium made my symptoms subside quickly. 

I’ve worked on correcting the issue but I’m not really having a super diverse diet mostly due to lack of prepping. I’d say in total between supplements and diet I’m getting around 2,000mg unless I take extra steps. 

But either way the main point of my question is - has anyone else experienced this after taking a break? My last transition into ketosis was nothing like this."

keto,Is it possible to do keto while avoiding eggs and dairy?,"Has anyone on here done keto without eggs, dairy, and red meat? 

I’m considering trying keto to combat my PCOS. Unfortunately, I am allergic to eggs and also lactose-intolerant. I’m already gluten-free as well (was told this would help with PCOS, but hasn’t done much), but there’s still plenty of dairy, egg, and gluten-free products I’ve been indulging on. I’m guessing my PCOS is insulin resistance related, and even though I’m gluten-free, I’m probably still eating too many carbs. 

I’m just worried that reducing my carb intake and going keto will cause me to become even more malnourished and constantly hungry. I’m quite a particular and have a fear of heart disease as it runs in my family, so I avoid fatty fried foods and red meat 98% of the time. As far as meat/protein goes, I really only eat turkey and chicken. Occasionally, like once or twice a month I will have red meat. Same thing with seafood. And then circling back to earlier, I cannot have eggs or dairy. I incorporate as many vegetables as I can into each meal and take supplements for what I may be lacking.

Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

However starting Jan 2020, with post grad stress/depression, starting my career, moving out, and the pandemic happening, I got way off track and gained about 10lbs. I re-started my journey again Sep 2020 at 151lbs and have now lost 22lbs and hit the 120s! 

I’ve been getting kinda frustrated with the slow weight loss but seeing my older pics has definitely made me feel better lol. Still have more pounds to lose but hopefully getting there! 🤞🏼

I'm now on OMAD after stalling for a bit. Now back to losing weight.
Weight loss has slowed but I'm in a bad head space for unrelated reasons and it's too cold to go walking now. 
I've never been on a diet this long in my life hence why i shouldn't really call it a diet, cause diet fails... 

Thank you all.

how do you guys deal with being away for a week or so without really a lot of control over your food?

I don’t do it for weightlost but I am trying to get my pcos under control.

I’ve also had an eczema problem on my hands and arms on and off for as long as I can remember. 

Anyway, I am only on day 2 of strict keto. 3 days ago I started a probiotic. 

Yesterday afternoon I started to experience diarrhea and some crazy smelling gas. Like nothing before. Gross. No stomach cramps or pain. 

Last night at work I started getting a sore throat and by the time I got home it was a full blown head cold. 

The eczema on my hands have been noticeably worse the past couple days. 

Could my body be freaking out due to the sudden dramatic changes? I’m feel like the probiotic could be the diarrhea culprit over Keto, but I’ve taken probiotics in the past and have never had this affect. 

I’m also aware of the keto flu from lurking on this sub, but I figured symptoms like that would occur maybe by day 3 or 4. I’m trying to stay on top of the electrolytes but I’m probably depleting them way faster because of the diarrhea. 
Is diarrhea a common occurrence while adjusting to keto? Can the keto flu strike this soon in? Thanks!"

keto,The small victories,"Been doing Keto since December. In the past I felt like my body responded extremely quick when eating healthy so maybe my expectations are unrealistic now that I’m in my early 30s. I went from 340lbs to 325lbs in the first 30 days but have only gone from 325lbs to 322lbs in the last two weeks and began to get very discouraged by not seeing more happen on the scale .

 Then I realized I was overlooking several small victories that happened over the last two weeks and focusing on the scale too much. Small victories included my work shirts not popping buttons off , I moved two belt notches/pants fitting better and I also no longer struggle to tie my shoes or wipe my behind. 

So what are some of your small victories that help keep you motivated and remind you even if the scale doesn’t move you’re still making progress? 

Also any recommendations for pushing through plateaus ? I haven’t started intermittent fasting yet but from what I’ve been seeing it seems to make a huge difference?"
keto,What is keto to you?,"I hear people saying this is or isn't keto. This food group isn't keto or whatever. I think I know the community's general answer but looking for insight otherwise about what keto really is. 

To me, keto is all about macros such to make our bodies fat-adapted and using ketones for energy rather than glucose. 

To me, there is not any particular food group off limits if it fits your macros. Yes, there is discouragement on singular foods like table sugar, honey, and other high glycemic index sweeteners. We also discourage grains like rice, oats, wheat, etc. Don't forget root veg and legumes. The reasoning isn't because legumes aren't keto but it's that they *usually* don't fit our macros. A product with wheat fiber or corn fiber isn't necessarily bad. Fiber is fiber, right?"
keto,New Here,"Hey! I'm new here and just wanted to say hi and ask a question! This is my 3rd attempt at Keto. I'm down 8 lbs the first week. What I wanted to ask is, what works best for you to keep yourself motivated?"
keto,Really surprised.,So before keto I had a little bit of a control issue I would eat and eat and eat kind of like binge eating but not quite on that level. And I am now 12 days into keto and I never have any trouble being full. And I combine fasting with keto and I am completely fine with being hungry sometimes it's so weird. I've also been around a few situations which before this I would have gladly taken part in but now I don't feel like it's worth it. Keto is easily sustainable don't let anyone tell you otherwise!
keto,What is this food freedom you speak of?,"Hey guys! I've been lurking on this sub for a while now because I really like to hear the success stories and tips. It keeps me motivated to do better! But one thing I've noticed that I don't understand is what is meant by keto being ""freeing.""

In context, I think it sort of means being able to control your dietary habits, but I'm not really sure. Can anyone expand on that?"
keto,Protein Level Confusion,"Hey everyone

Just starting my Keto journey about 1.5 weeks ago and am already down 6kg. Yay!!

However, I have some confusion on protein levels. I use Cronometer and most things suggest to choose sedentary if you are tracking exercise with something else which I am. I have a Garmin watch and use the Connect App to record my workouts which then write back to Cronometer.

I used the recommended macro calc - [https://calculo.io/keto-calculator](https://calculo.io/keto-calculator)

It says I should have 127g of protein a day but I am concerned that is too low because I am not factoring in exercise there. Am I wrong? I get around 10k steps a day, mostly from walking my dogs but also I hike 1 day up a mountain every weekend and I also have an elliptical that I will do 30 minutes on.

I am male, 44, 175cm (5'9"") and 130kg(286lbs)

Any help is appreciated!"
keto,How do you prevent yourself from getting addicted to the scale?,"I have been weighing myself every morning when I get up, even though I want to be able to do it only every week, I can’t resist the urge. It’s like I have to make sure I’m still on track but I would like to feel more sense of progress by not doing it everyday."
keto,Successful but ‘incomplete’ weight loss story. How do I maintain the enthusiasm that got me this far?,"Alright folks - this is both a success story &amp; a call for help. I started keto late July 2020, and have lost roughly 30lbs (woo!). My body has transformed &amp; all my clothes fit again. Problem is, I’m still 15lbs away from my goal weight &amp; I’ve stalled hard. It’s been nearly 2mo since I moved the scale, and while I know exactly why (stopped logging carbs/calories in app)—I’m having trouble recommitting.

Good news is I haven’t gained, but man am I struggling to recapture the enthusiasm I had for those first several months. It feels like a mental block. Maybe bc I feel/look so much better than I did at the start of my journey, I’m not as motivated to be as strict? Has anyone else dealt with this as they approach their GW? 

Nobody I know does keto, so I rely heavily on this community for motivation &amp; shared experience. How do I force myself over this hump??"
keto,Issues with sleep on keto,"Hi all!

Has anyone else had issues getting restful sleep while on keto and has anything helped?

It's not insomnia, exactly, but I wake up very often throughout the night and just feel more run down in the mornings than usual. During the day generally feel normal, no usual symptoms of electrolyte deficiencies or anything. 

I'm already planning on introducing some extra magnesium supplementation (got Calm) but would love any other advice on things to try."
keto,Need tips to expedite meal planning,I’m back on the keto train for 2021 and find I only stick to it if I thoroughly plan out each weeks meals. But it honestly takes so long to do it right that I’m already over it lol. I can’t afford a meal delivery service but are there any plans/programs that would make the weekly planning easier? Any suggestion are much appreciated.
keto,Where are you getting your magnesium these days?,"It's easy to get potassium, since I can just purchase lite salt. Does anyone have a similar tip for magnesium?

I did a search of /r/keto but the results were mostly years old. All my local stores seem to only carry magnesium oxide supplements. Did anyone find a good source of magnesium citrate or glycinate that's carried in most grocery stores?

I did find that dark chocolate has a significant amount, but I'd need to eat two full large bars a day for 300mg, which would be almost a thousand calories - a bit much haha."
keto,Down 24lbs in 4 months,"Been looking here and r/ketorecipes for awhile now. I have been on lazy keto and IF for 4 months now. The first week I lost 7lbs in water weight, but have been slow and steady for the remainder. 

I don't track my calories, but at first kept my carbs to very low levels. I now have gone from around &lt;30 carbs to &lt;60 as my goal to a super slow transition to allowing more carbs in my diet from vegetables, nuts, and seeds. I add a triple seed mix of hemp, chia, and flax seed to tons of things I cook now, it's great for getting plenty of fiber. The biggest change has been cutting out sugar completely. I used to have terrible inflammation that has gone away completely. Best thing is the compliments I get from coworkers on how I look, and always feeling full.

keto,What am I doing wrong.,"46, 149, 5,7

I’m in back at 148-149 instead of ideal weight at 145 :( not sure what I’m doing wrong. I’m avoiding sugar and no grains or bread.

3 pics: This was yesterday. https://imgur.com/a/c1KuadC

And the day before: https://imgur.com/a/laYWTV0

I eat protein, the fat is there. Carbs are pretty much on point.

Looking at my food I gotta eliminate something, but I don’t get why as it all fits in with keto."
keto,High Blood Pressure and Keto?,"So I recently found out from a doctor that I have high blood pressure; the biggest way to bring it down is to cut out salt (no more ketoade). But I want to know if anyone else has had success in bringing their blood pressure down with keto, and if there are any recipes on foods out there that are keto friendly that are also good to help fight high blood pressure? Also, how can I go about getting my electrolytes now?"
keto,My mom may want me to quit keto,"I want to eat normally but at the same time I don't want to quit keto. If you check my last post, you will see why my mom doesn't want me to do keto or fasting and because she hates buying anything keto friendly. I haven't really been able to make much on keto, it is primarily pieces of cheese and deli meat along with salads. I'm not sure what to do here. It did work for a while but my weight isn't really going down much and being sick is terrible"
keto,10kg lost in 9 days of keto!,"I love this! I've finally found something that works for me and I feel better than ever! 

I'm 6'4"" and I decided to do start keto as a last effort when I hit 116kg. I have started a running training program and have been doing intermittent fasting since last February. I am now 106kg and its only been 9 days! I'm aware a lot of this is water weight but I feel so much healthier and awake and my stomach has stopped being so bloated which is incredible. And I can still eat all of my favourite things! 

For anyone considering doing keto, please give it a chance! I think the thing that really gets me through each day without cheating or messing up is the biological fact that if I mess up even once, I'm kicked out of ketosis and I have to start again. Not having that option to cheat has given me the discipline to stick to it and I can only see a bright future for my health and weight loss!

keto,OMAD &amp; keto,"Hi all,

Back on keto 2 weeks now after spending Nov &amp; Dec drinking &amp; eating whatever I wanted, mostly carby takeouts &amp; gin. I kept strict OMAD throughout this so I’ve been OMAD since March 2020 pretty much every day apart from maybe 5 days I ate during the day over the holidays.

I’m not posting about a stall since it’s only been a couple weeks and I know a stall is longer, but I’ve remained at 69kg for these two weeks despite strict carb/calorie tracking (5”11 27yo male, no more than 1300 calories, between 16-22g carbs daily mostly from veg, 130g protein, staying below fat limit). 

I’m KCKO since I know I’ll eventually get the whoosh and not concerned about this, but I’m wondering if anyone who’s done OMAD for a year or longer has had success with switching it up to two/three meals a day to get things going? Thinking maybe my body has got used to OMAD and could do with a switch up. Doing a 48 hour fast first this weekend but also seeing if the opposite would help after this fast.

I also recognise that 1300 is a fairly hefty deficit at 30% and maybe my body is “clinging” on, anyone have experience of reducing deficit with success? Just asking all these questions because they, in my mind, seem counterintuitive to weight loss but maybe someone’s tried it out!

Cheers"
keto,How does ketosis differs from 'normal' weightloss?,"Hello there!  
While I am not following a keto diet at this moment, rather CICO aiming at loosing weight, I made pretty good progress in the past month's.  
I still eat carbs, not much and I hate sugar, but bread and noodles nonethereless.  
My question is, since I've read it several times here already, that a ketogenic metabolic state starts at around the 3rd day into eating very low carbs, how exactly differs keto fat burn from 'normal' fat burn during a caloric deficit?  
Am I actually doing a kind of 'on/off' ketosis state everyday, when my glucogene is used up my body switches to ketones for energy?  
How exactly does the 3 day window comes into play, if I'm eating carbs every day?  
I don't believe that all of my weight was actually water weight, I've lost way too much for that already.  
  
Looking forward for your answers!"
keto,January is half over and it is resolution quitting time,"We have officially hit the time period, the next week, when people start to stop behaviors they started January 1st.

Why? 

Because you are awesome"
keto,KETO Poo,"I know many people on Keto struggle with their bowel movements. I am a long term keto adherent (close to ten years) and I can tell you that there is a light at the end of the tunnel (no pun intended). The advice given for the problem in this subreddit is generally good, especially the advice about lots of water. But something that isn't discussed is flora/fauna in the bowels. What grows in your bowels is to a degree based upon your diet, when you change your diet it takes time clean out the old neighbourhood and for the new neighbours to become established, I think some of the older neighbours are reluctant to give up their real estate. My experience is that my bowel movements were normally daily prior to keto, when I started keto it became a somewhat rare celebratory event. After a year, they were much better and after a couple of years they were as regular as before keto. Your mileage may differ, but most of the longer term keto people I know have had similar experiences."
keto,Keto Coffee on the go,What chain coffee shop/ stores offer bulletproof coffee. I know you can usually get Kerrygold and a splash of heavy whipping cream added to a coffee at Starbucks; but I was wondering if any other popular places have a better option.
keto,I was 180 and muscular. Now I am almost 270 and weak after a bad drug addiction. I need to turn my life around,"I used to be a hunk when I was 180. Now I can't even look myself in the mirror. Didn't help that I recently quit doing cocaine and used weed to help me curb my cravings. For those who don't know, You start eating ALOT more when you start detoxing and get clean from cocaine. The hormone leptin is pretty much non existent for folks who have abused cocaine. This, multiplied with the fact that I was smoking weed to curb my cocaine cravings. It equated to some insane munchies. Needless to say, I started gaining weight super fast. In fact I noticed alot of addictive tendencies I had for drugs now translated into food. 

In example, when I got depressed/mad I would go out and party. Now, when I get depressed/mad I would grab some cookies or eat some food. It became robotic, before I would even notice I would already be stuffing a bunch of food down my throat.

I want to love myself again and get clean from my food addiction. I think keto would be amazing for me but I AM A CARBAHOLIC and can't even imagine me without carbs. 

Any advice? Where do I start? How do I get into the mindset for keto? What worked for you?"
keto,Keto for picky eaters,"Hi guys, 

i've been wanting to start kept for a while but couldn't think i could because i'm such a picky eater and hate almost anything i don't usually like.

but i wanna get serious about keto now so it can jumpstart my weight loss journey and i'd like to know what i can eat without being picky.

i don't eat meat so i get my protein from eggs, i like nuts (only sunflowers, peanuts, and almonds), vegetables (only onions, carrots, lemons/limes,) and that's pretty much it 

i'm more of a fruit person which is why i don't really go for vegetables...."
keto,Can I turn down the fat/cheese in meals and still do keto right?,"A first timer here so please be patient if this is seemingly obvious to you.

how much fat do you put in your meals? And can I turn it down to see better results.

I mean I know keto is 75% fat 20% protein and 5% carbs, but I can't seem to lose the amount of weight I was expecting to. It's been almost 2 weeks and I've barely lost 1-2 kgs. I'll admit Ive had 3 nights of whiskey here and there, but nothing more than 2 or 3 glasses.

There are times when prepping meals that I end up putting excess cheese and fat where I could've easily survived without, now I know this is counter intuitive to the whole keto diet, but can I just reduce the amount of fat to make better gains is what I'm thinking 🤔"
keto,Newly diagnosed with PCOS - does keto help? (Also prediabetic),"Wasn’t sure if I should use the medical or help flair, sorry if it’s the wrong one. I’ve struggled to lose weight my whole adolescence and I now know why - PCOS and insulin resistance have made my journey difficult. At 21, I’m now prediabetic. My A1C reading is now at 6.0 but it was at 6.2 pre-Christmas. I’m wondering, for anyone else here who may have PCOS (if you’re not diagnosed but still suspect it please comment too! I trust your gut if you feel like you have it but can’t get diagnosed. It took me 9 years of fighting to get here, I understand the struggle). Does a low carb high fat diet help with those of us who struggle to lose weight despite trying other methods? I’ll be honest, after I was diagnosed with prediabetes (and wrongly diagnosed with diabetes over the phone) I spiraled into not eating at all and lost about 5 pounds but after surgery I’ve gained it all back. I feel lost. I think sugar is the problem here and once I’m off my winter break I can really eliminate all of it out of my diet but I’m afraid this will just be another attempt with no results. After so many years of trying, I’m not sure what else I CAN do but try keto. Thank goodness my endocrinologist knew about keto and said if I cut carbs I can reverse the prediabetes but she’s not so sure about the weight and, well, this only gets worse if I get heavier. If you’ve had success with PCOS and keto please let me know - I would love to hear from you. And even if you don’t have PCOS but couldn’t seem to lose weight I would also love to hear your input! Sorry for the long and sad post, and for the potential mistakes. I’m a long time lurker and first time poster here."
keto,I chose wisely tonight. Every decision matters.,"I got back on the keto wagon recently. Tonight we went out and had a few drinks (outside in Florida no judgement please). I had a dry sparkling wine. I felt tipsy. NORMALLY (covid recently) I would eat carbs to sober up when I got home. I pulled out the Mac and cheese and set it on the counter. I told my boyfriend, I wanted to keep losing weight! So instead I made eggs with cheese and turkey sausage. And you know what? I sobered up. I didn’t mess up my diet and I feel good. Small victories. Soooo glad I didn’t make the Mac and cheese box. And the food was delicious and whole. This victory will carry me forward 🎈 and the garbage box food wasn’t worth it. 

It’s the little, everyday, choices."

keto,Keto Diet- effect on cholesterol,"I have had much success with the keto diet and probably am in the best shape of my life. I have been on the this diet for about 8 months now and have adjusted my lifestyle accordingly, but my dilemma now is my health(cholesterol primarily). I'm 48 y.o. and on my last lab report, my bad cholesterol was moderately high and good cholesterol was extremely low. Many of the keto friendly foods are high in fat...granted unsaturated fats are good for you and essential. However, saturated fat can most certainly be taken to an extreme as many retailers/manufacturers load it into many ""keto friendly"" bars, drinks, etc. And you can also overload on meat, cream, &amp; cheese(all keto friendly items). 

I recall vividly when I used to be a certified as a nutrition expert many years ago the fact that saturated fat is worse for cholesterol levels than actually eating cholesterol(seafood, egg yolks, etc). Now many younger people and so forth might need not worry about this, but at 48 I do not want to die young or have a heart attack/stroke in the never-ending quest to be in shape. Does anyone know more about this subject? One guy at a nutrition store told me that if you eat saturated fat from animals(meat), it is worse than if you eat saturated fat from coconuts &amp; MCT oil, etc. Is this true?"
keto,Thoughts about the Green Chef keto box?,"I’d love to hear thoughts about the Green Chef keto box. We’re on our second week of four meals and I canceled after this week for a few reasons.

The pros for me included the meal variety and creativity. We made a few meals that we likely would have thought to make had we not gotten the box, such as a Moroccan shrimp bisque. 

The cons were plenty. I thought the portions of most dishes were tiny. Literally half a cup of cauliflower rice with a few seasonings and a small piece of protein. I didn’t feel full and keto meals nearly always fill me up easily. The flavor was lacking in some of the dishes. The carb count is way too high in several. The highest we got had 18g net carbs per serving. 

I’d love to hear thoughts from others. Love it? Hate it?"
keto,NSV: lowest blood pressure of my life,"Let me preface by saying that my blood pressure has never been chronically high. Occasionally I might get a reading in the past that was something like 130/80, and for me, that would be high. Normal for me was, well, higher end of normal, something like 120-80. I’m in my late twenties and extremely fortunate to have had such luck for so long despite my size.

I started keto on New Years Day. There have definitely been some bumps in the road, but already two weeks in the NSVs are piling up. I’m using less allergy medicine than I ever have, having less migraines, sleeping soundly through the night, and most unexpectedly, my blood pressure is now coming in at an average of 105/70. 

I’m losing on the scale, too, but it’s the non-scale things that feel best! Probably the most striking change for me I’ve noticed already is that I don’t spend all day and night thinking about food or eating anymore. I also have no problem leaving a plate half-full or tossing something I don’t like, and I no longer snack out of boredom mindlessly. Huge changes, over here!"

keto,"I jogged on the same day that I fasted for 21 hours, broke keto and almost defecated myself","I'm 16F and im bitter that my mom made me eat carbs because I fainted. I am used to fasting but taking a hot shower right after jogging was a terrible idea. I lost my vision, screamed for help, fell inside my fridge looking for a keto item and almost shit myself while my mom dragged me to my room. She wouldn't let me put clothes on until I ate 4 pretzels and drank coconut water (I drink a gallon of water a day btw). I hate coconut water, waste of calories. She also made me eat pasta and yelled at me for fasting. Great. I ruined keto, I was a few minutes away from 21 hours and I didn't even jog that much."
keto,Has anyone tried toothpaste for cravings?,"I came across this product called sweet defeat, it basically blocks the sugar receptions in your tongue thus blocking any sweet taste. i was about to buy it, but then got the idea that toothpaste does basically the same thing, so if i mix toothpaste with baking soda, and make small candy sized drops, then pop one everytime im craving something, maybe itll work the same way?"

I’m curious about other people and how their ketones react!?   



My keto lifestyle consists of mainly meats and animal products, much like carnivore. Vegetables and fruits I reserve for the times I’m really craving them... (there’s no reason I like meat more) generally it’s loaded broccoli, Caesar salad, cucumber slices and tuna salad or bacon wrapped jalepeno poppers."
keto,Help me lose weight,"Hi everyone. I started keto in august and I’ve lost 23 pounds in 5 months. I lost a bunch right away and now it’s like 1-2 pounds a month. Please don’t say “you shouldn’t complain, that’s fast enough”. 1-2 pounds a month is slow on keto. I’m 36f 5’6 SW 208 CW 185. What am I doing wrong?? I do eat fast food but Dr Westman said fast food is fine if it’s keto. If I eat breakfast I get a McDonald’s sausage egg and cheese with no muffin and a Diet Coke. I try to skip breakfast though. For lunch I’ll have a salad from Wendy’s like the southwest avocado salad or I’ll get a bacon cheese quarter pounder with no bun and no ketchup. Dinner my husband cooks, always meat and either a salad or steamed veggies like broccoli or asparagus. I eat sugar free jello with whipped cream, Lilly’s chocolate, macadamia nuts or cheese as a snack. Am I like way out of line with calories?? Please don’t judge or be rude I’m really trying and would just truly like some advice. Thank you"
keto,Keto for 2 years - blood sugar?,"Hey! 

I have been on the keto diet for around 2 years and I go in and out of a high to moderate level of ketosis, a version of cycling that works well for my migraines. I am getting strict with my macros again and I wanted to watch my blood ketone levels but also my glucose  (something I read from KetoMojo got me excited about it). I was curious to see if I reacted to certain foods, mainly dairy and as it turns out my blood sugar doesn't fluctuate much at all which is good news for me on the dairy front. 

So my first question is, has anyone experienced a fasting (8 - 16 hours with out food) blood sugar around 90-100mg/dl after being keto for a long duration of time? I have heard that there are a few reasons this might be (liver creates glucose, body doesn't need it, it hangs around etc. ) but I wanted to hear from some actual people. \*\*Also, please note I have never had any insulin/glucose problems and I am average weight. 

Second questions is, recently I seem to have blood sugar around 90 -105 which I test right before eating and then after (about an hour) it lowers to like 85mg/dl.  This isn't exactly the case every single time, but it has been a trend. 

I also feel great and don't have any other reason for concern other than seeing these somewhat surprising numbers. Back two years ago I didn't really test my blood sugar, only ketones so I don't have much to go off of there, however all my A1C tests are normal and have always been normal. 

Is this normal? Should I be concerned? Have you experienced the same thing?"

keto,High protein help!,"I am having a really hard time getting enough protein and I’m curious what others are doing.

keto,5kg lost in 2 weeks!,"I’m a very obese child. I am 170cm tall and was 102kg. I started keto about 2 weeks ago. Not really sure. But I am now down to 97kg. I really hope I can keep this consistency up and knowing there is a whole community doing this with me really helps. My end game goal is to have an average BMI or to look ‘normal’, and not be the round blob I was."
keto,I can no longer have peanut butter or cream cheese in the house...,"Because I eat it all in one sitting. Every. Single. Time. 

Same with any keto dessert. I make keto cookies and then eat half the batch. I don’t think I can handle being around any sort of dessert, so I am just going to go cold turkey on this one. 

Can anyone else relate? So far, what helps a little bit is flavored sparkling water (key lime pie la croix, for instance). Does anyone else on here strictly never have any dessert? How’s that going?

On another note, I think I need to quit the wine as well. I usually end up having over 3 glasses and then making poor food choices in addition. Has anyone quit drinking along with keto? I want still want to have a social life (post covid) but I don’t want to be tempted, so maybe I’d try to order diet soda. 

Happy Thursday y’all!"

keto,"How much of a calorie deficit is too much, and what symptoms should I be looking out for?","Hey Keto-gurus,

I've been on Keto for a while, but saw little to no result due to overeating and not watching carbs. I enjoy the diet and recently moved to take it seriously to lose weight.

I mostly exercise by walking places I otherwise wouldn't and I am going to do some some HIIT and functional training every few days in the next few days.

Looking at BMR and the amount of calories I burn combined, I seem to be burning about 2800-3500. I feel full and at good health with plenty of energy, but I wondered if too high a deficit could be detrimental. I checked out a calculator on the site, which generated the stats at the bottom.

It seems to me that the edge is razor thin at the amount of calories I'm eating and burning, whether or not I lose fat or start losing muscle due to atrophy. Does anyone know if it's really necessary to up my calorie intake? Any advice would be enlightening :)

keto,Confused: Why are my blood ketones so low?,"Confused. Ketones fluctuating between low to moderate, but never getting into the “high” range (beyond 1.5 nmol/l)

Hey guys, relatively new to this. I'm wondering if anyone had a similar experience?

Me and my roommates have started doing a ketogenic diet this new year. I began before them, before christmas. I have lyme disease, so I’ve been making sure to consume no more than 10 carbs a day. My roommates have been consuming up to 30 carbs a day

I'm trying to get the majority of my calories from pure fat, either butter, coconut oil, or beef fat. I try and keep my protein under 100g per day. As far as carbs go, there is really none, save for 4 (net) in 4 tablespoons peanutbutter, and 2 every night in the 6 mg melatonin i take to help sleep.

I bought the blood finger-prick test and we tried it out. My roommates were 2.0+ nmol/l but I was only 0.5 nmol/l, even though i've been doing the diet for longer and eating less carbs the entire time. In the mornings I’m no higher than 1.5 nmol/l.

Yesterday during the day, I ate literally no carbs, and 50g protein. When I tested my ketones, they were back down to .05 nmol/l. I trust the readings because my roommates always test at the same time as me, morning and evening, and always only ever fluctuate between 2.0 and 3.0.

In the past 3.5 weeks, as I’ve adhered strictly to this diet, I have noticed many improvements. My skin looks better, I'm not holding any water, but apparently I'm just not that ""deep""  into ketosis. I've read posts and articles where individuals do regimented case studies on themselves, and they eat up to 150g protein a day and 20g carbs a day and still find themselves in the 2 - 3 range on the blood tests.

Why am I still so low?

This morning when I woke up, I pricked my finger again... 1.5

That was a relief to see, but still not where I wanted it given that I haven't really touched a carb in 3 weeks.

My roommates suggest it must be something I supplement with, because I have an armada of supplements I take every morning, but none of them should contain anything that would knock me out of ketosis. Truly... I’ve checked. All amino acids and pure forms of vitamins. 

So odd, I almost feel like some meat/fat products I buy have somehow been spiked with sugar, lol. Both my roommates sympathetically note (in response to my want of ketones) they are a bit huskier than I am. I'm probably 13% body fat, where they're both much huskier. They probably both have 50 to 100 lbs on me, but they're also just bigger guys. I don't think that should really make a difference.

Any input, anecdotes, etc. really helps. Thanks for taking the time to read my post. I'd love to hear what you have to say."
keto,Does keto/low carb make you feel full for longer?,"I have been trying to lose weight for sometime now. I have been (trying) to eat around 1,500 calories a day.

keto,Insoluble Fiber vs Soluble Fiber,"I'm not sure what the difference is between Insoluble Fiber and Soluble Fiber.

But under that label, it has 10g of insoluble fiber and 2g of soluble fiber. So is the final net carbs 2?"
keto,Help/questions!!,"Can you guys help me or advice me pleasee!!! Not losing any weight or inches for 4 weeks now and it's really frustrating!!!!! My body looks the same for weeks, clothes aren't any loser from the initial loss (i lost 12lbs) , i keep just going thinking it will drop but nothing yet!! I've been doing omad+keto for 2 and a half months thinking to drop that and eat 2 meals maybe that will help?!  Its kinda hard when the whole family eats unhealthy, doesn't believe in keto. I used to eat around 700-800 cals before keto then when i started keto i ate around 800-1000 but i was told i was crash dieting and that later when i'm lighter i will need to lower my calories even more to lose weight so i increased my intake to 1150-1250 cals. I also workout 5-6x a week.

According to the keto calculator these are my macros. I track everything and still no difference.

91 grams of protein 68 grams of fat and total carbs are 20-25

I'm 5'5 and SW 177/CW 165/GW 130

Its also very hard to reach my protein and not go over fat!!

I also read about the whoosh effect as 2 weeks ago i was feeling my fat getting really soft and jiggly but then no whoosh and now its firmer then before still soft but not much!!

Should i drop omad and see how it goes with with 16:8 or 18:6?

I recently started feeling very tired as well and have headaches often.

What should i do??

Any help would be appreciated!!!"

keto,Confused with carb tracking,"Day 4 of Keto. I’ve been using my usual Lifesum app (for other diets) You can create new food using their nutrition lable and use it because different brands have different nutritional value for some reason even though it’s the exact same thing.

Everyone here recommended Carb Manager so I thought to give it a go. The problem is, the carbs don’t match the nutrition labels of my food at all. Which do I follow? 

I was thinking of using Lifesum for food that comes with a nutrition lable and for food that doesn’t have it like tomatoes, I’ll use the macros from Crab manager."
keto,Just binged and probably ruined ketosis,"I ate a whole papa johns pizza, I feel gross, I was doing so good I had a 8 day streak of ketosis. I feel so bleh and know whenever I binge once it turns into days and I want to learn how to accept one day of failure and keep going, because usually I give up, but keto was the only thing I had felt satisfied on. I wasn’t even hungry or craving it. I just missed the emotional binging of food and the comfort I think. I wasn’t dying for carbs at all, in fact I was so full after two slices I had to shove the rest down. Has anyone been able to overcome this? I used to be a crash dieter and stay under 1200 but with keto I’ve been allowing myself 1600 calories which really helped me stay satisfied but now I feel like I ruined it with one bad day, if I can’t get thru 8 days of keto how can I keep the streak, it’s so annoying that I’m weak willed."
keto,Well... I ruined dinner,"So I made a big experimental oopsie.

I added it, stirred it through, and came back 10 minutes later to a gelatinous bland goopy mess. 

I added 3 tbsp to a large slowcook pot. Looking back, it was far too much.
Does this effect have to do with how much I added or does psyllium husk always create a gelatinous texture?"

keto,Keto hit me a little too hard...,"This is just me relaying a keto mistake I did. Don’t be me, folks. Essentially, I’ve been doing as much keto as I can for almost 9 days now, and just recently I’ve been feeling kinda shitty. I’m having some mild but persistent headaches, making me feel kind of fuzzy. Among other weird symptoms. I was also perpetually hungry. I ascribed it to keto as maybe a lack of sugar or carbs my body is used to - I’m normally a sugar freak - so I stuck with that initially. Fatties gonna fat, I told myself. 

From day one, I stopped counting my calories because I assumed that I’d probably be eating more than enough considering that keto is high protein and fat. I have lean meats and healthy fats like eggs every day, and I drain excess oil or use small slices of butter for cooking. Veggies get stuffed in as much as I can.. No fried chicken, too much sauce or whatever in salads, moderate nuts like almonds, everything was bare and clean. So I assumed this was sufficient.

Apparently not. I had a hunch that my eating habits still weren’t right because of my symptoms of discomfort, so I kind of “relapsed” and decided to count my calories, which was easy considering I keep a log of everything I eat. And the real issue ended up being that even if I rounded *up* the foods I eat, I was averaging at around 700-800 calories a day. Which is obviously detrimental.. though probably not that bad for a petite female like me.

It’s just hard to eat a lot on this diet considering most of my usual extra 1000 calories would be from carbs and sugar, and cooking is tough. On top of that I force myself to keep a daily workout routine to get leaner. I obviously want to eat more, but I’m disordered eating recover-er and I’m scared of gaining weight, even though I’m pretty sure I’ve only lost water weight after a mere week. 

It’s tough :/"
keto,Finally! Down 100lbs after 9 months!,"So I set three goals for myself:

* **~~Phase 1 - Get under 200lbs~~**

* **~~Phase 2 - Net loss of 100lbs+~~**

* **Phase 3 - Reach 169lbs ^^^^nice and have a body fat of 15% or less.** *-Coming soon*

I had committed to not making any sort of posts about weight loss, or really mention it to almost anyone until I'd reached phase 2.  Which was today, fuck yeah!

Regrettably I don't have a cool before/after photo, because I don't generally like having my picture taken.  
What I do have for you number nerds out there, is this sick graph, it's like a god damned black diamond slope.

https://i.imgur.com/55Mhcpj.jpg
    
Here's to story so far:

* Mid-March, when the quarantine started, I figured, ""Hey, this is a great time to trivially kick my food addiction"".

 So I did.  
 
 I spent the first 4 months on a self imposed ELCD, which also restricted all carb and fat intake heavily. 
    I went wayyy overboard on this and would not recommend unless you do so under strict medical supervision.  
&gt;    My macros were roughly 400-600cal / ~5-6g fat / 60g prot / ~10-15 carbs during this period

 I wanted to find the level of raw energy intake my body absolutely required to operate.  For me, working a desk job, in complete isolation, not moving more than 10ft a day, sedentary was not a strong enough word.  I had/have the metabolism of a cadaver.  I found my threshold for satiety to be just over 600cal.  Any less, and I'd have fainting spells if I moved too much in a day. At this point I still hadn't remembered keto existed and was merrily doing my own thing.


* For the next 2-3 months, after the extreme cut, I increased my intake levels.

 &gt; My macros were roughly 650-900cal / ~5-6g fat / 60-80g prot / ~20-30 carbs during this period

 It was during this period that I realized, ""oh shit, I'm accidentally keto right now, cool."" so I raised an eyebrow and logged on to r/keto.  Since I was nearly on a popular structured diet at this point, I thought it'd be a great opportunity to read up on common pitfalls, oft-forgotten nutrients, and to steal ideas from fellow /r/keto denizens.
I found less in terms of tips and tricks, and instead walked away with a generally better understanding of my body and proper nutrition.  Emotionally though I was reaching a threshold; I had persisted up to this point on grit alone. Reading through all the stories and seeing the pictures other people had posted was critical in keeping me on track.  Having gathered up vicarious motivation from said posts I pushed forward.

* The last 3 months have been a SLOG, in terms of weight loss, but for very good reasons.
&gt; My macros during this period were ~900-1100cal / ~30-40g fat / 80-100g prot / 20-40g carbs 

 I focused on finding the other end of my energy spectrum: my maintenance level. Contrary to the previous two paragraphs; I do actually enjoy eating/tasting things, so the last few months have been spent experimenting with new flavors, nutrient sources, self control exercises, etc... I wanted to make sure I understood my body's signals when it was gaining, losing, and maintaining.  So I fucked with it, a lot.  You'll see that wild yoyo in the end of the graph.  I learned more about myself in that last stretch than in the 7 months prior; though as evidenced by the existence of this post, I didn't just maintain, I thrived.

* The next 6-18 months I expect will be the hardest ones.  I'll be transitioning from a maintenance macro allotment, into an active level, with ~60-90min of strenuous exercise daily.  While doing so I'll also be further training my impulse control with regard to introducing delicious things back into my diet.  

 &gt; My target macros going forward will be ~1100-1400cal / 30-60g fat / 80-100g prot / 10-40 carbs



**If you made it this far without even needing to see my wasfat/nownotsofat pictures, then hats off to you, here's a TLDR of what I learned along the way.**

* I am an addict and I have an eating disorder; not formally diagnosed, but obvious.  Under the right circumstances I will binge eat an unhealthy amount of food beyond my body's needs.  I do not show any of the external symptoms I would have expected, but after introspection, it's obvious to me.  I suspect it's a nurtured behavior I learned from the staple American diet while growing up, and as such, I'd gently suggest you give it a thought for yourself.  Really, really, critically, examine your eating behaviors and consider why you eat/ate the quantity you do/did.  
* Food is, first and foremost, fuel; all the social, emotional, and taste pleasure considerations should come second.  Make sure you're eating enough, and that you aren't nutrient deficient.  It's easy to not notice you are critically deficient in something you had never even thought about.
* In the same line of thought, if you've considered a VLC diet, especially in combination with keto, get a consult from your doctor first, and start a regimen that they can monitor.  There's a reason the entire internet screams in bold **DO NOT GO ON A ELCD/VLCD WITHOUT MEDICAL SUPERVISION** I may have been glib about fainting in my prior remarks, but the first time it happened it was terrifying and dangerous. I blacked out and dropped like a ragdoll from a standing position.  If I had been going down the stairs, or just fell wrong and hit my head, it could have been lights out for good.  Be Safe.  
* There are SO MANY FLAVORS out there I never even considered.  You may think to yourself ""oh no, but I really love sugar!"" bruh... fuck sugar, it's trash.  Even putting aside how tasty the low glycemic impact sweeteners are; there is a universe of flavors out there to play around with in the realms of sweet, savory, spicy, salty, and fresh.  If you get a hankering for a slice of cake, you may find that trying something completely new and healthy can satiate that craving instead.  Keto versions of favorites are fine and all, but substituting the bad food with as close to the bad food as you can get can be a crutch. Change the paradigm, start thinking about new foods or taste profiles that you've never even eaten before.  IE: Don't try to find a keto donut; try to find a keto friendly snack that goes with your coffee in the morning. 
* If you frequent scenarios where social pressures may influence your food choices, just remember, those motherfuckers don't know about your macro gospel. Society doesn't teach us that we should be considerate of others dietary needs when offering/gifting things.  We, at least where I was raised, weren't taught to give it a single thought.
* The hunger monster is real, and it will fuck your head up if you don't see the warning signs.  Keep an eye out for it.

I look forward to the days ahead, and when I hit phase 3, I promise I'll take some proper pictures for ya'll.

The flour is a blend of almond flour, coconut flour, golden flaxseed, oat fiber, xantham gum, and whey protein isolate. I know with the coconut flour, it will definitely need more liquid when substituting for just almond flour as it's more absorbant, but I don't really know how the other ingredients will influence the recipe.

Thought I would let others know about the flour, and see if someone who understands baking more than I do might find have helpful hints or suggestions. (Or recipes using similar blends)"

keto,What do I do to get more calories?,"20YOM / SW:227 / CW:218 / GW:200 - Moderate exercise  

Hello all. I am currently around two weeks into keto. I recently switched to calorie deficit after following a 2000 calorie diet. My food consist of:

B: two eggs &amp; 2oz of sausage 
Snack 1: 1oz cheddar cheese
L: tuna, Mayo, in a mozzarella cheese wrap
Snack 2: 1oz salami 
D: steak and cheese no bun 

I switched to this because I don’t eat veggies and the macros were great however, the calorie intake can vary from 800-1100 depending if I am able to eat those snacks or not. I do not feel hungry and this is normal to eat this minimal pre keto. Should I be concerned with those low calorie numbers if I’m not hungry.

So I started keto on September 4, 2020 a few days after my birthday and I noticed large weight loss within the first month, around 20 pounds. After that it started to slow down drastically to the point where the entire month of December to January I lost close to no pounds at all. I’m doing pretty strict keto I’m only allowing at most 15 carbs a day and now that the gyms are open again I just started recently going back to the gym where I do mostly cardio for 40 minutes to an hour a day. I understand how plateaus work but I feel like even after A month of strict keto I should’ve lost a little bit more than 2 pounds. Does anyone have any ideas on how to get out of a plateau a little faster or how to start on my metabolism again? I’m going to the gym again now that they’ve opened back up so hopefully that helps with this whole situation."

keto,Some Encouragement!! Needed to share with those who would understand😀,"A year ago today I started keto, determined to get my shit together after failing years before at every single “diet” I tried. This time last year I was sneaking snacks in my car coming home from work, and then throwing the empty bags out because I was so embarrassed and disgusted. 

Now, I’m 52lbs down.. I can run for 5 minutes straight without wanting to die. I feel good in my clothes. I feel beautiful again without having to fake it. I feel GOOD! Getting my mind in check was the hardest experience I’ll probably ever go through. Food benders were my thing. Emotional/stress eating was my thing. That was HARD to breakthrough, but I did it! You can do it too. People do not lie when they say “it’s a lifestyle change”. The moment that clicks with you, you’re in for a wild ride. 

Remember: COMPARISON IS THE THIEF OF JOY! You will often see folks losing at a rapid pace and that might get you down, but every person’s journey is theirs. Yours is YOURS.

So I'm in the ""I can't stand myself and need to change"" boat. 6'3"" male at ~330lb. My goal weight is in the 240 or lower range but I have a number of obstacles that I don't know how to get around.

1st, I was in a rather bad car accident when I was 19 (25 now), I've got quite a bit of metal in me, a bad back, permanently messed up collarbone, and bad ankles. Some days I have to walk with a cane, though that is much rather now (once or twice a year at most). I'm willing to work through discomfort but it definitely lowers how much I can handle in a workout session.

2nd and this is the biggy, dieting. I've previously had tremendous success with keto, I got down 65lb pre covid but fell off the wagon due to various stresses. I'd start it again as I actually really enjoyed it, but my girlfriend has been on a recovery path from eating disorders and just talking about a restricted diet/calorie counting is sensitive for her. She's already at a healthy weight and beautiful to boot, but I'd hate to negatively influence her progress. Eating healthy is fine for her, but the stereotypical healthy eating has never worked for me, I grew up eating homegrown fruits and veggies but my body really likes to keep weight. 

3rd issue, willpower. Im certainly a social eater, if it's just myself I can forgo pretty much any craving, but if there's someone else eating a piece of pie I'm going to want 2. With the aforementioned girlfriend this would be tough as she's quite the emotional eater. 

My doctor has given me a relatively clean bill of health, even my BP is fine, but I miss being comfortable in my clothes and not getting winded from the stuff I like to do.

I'll take any advice I can get.


I posted this on r/loseit as well, so sorry for the double if you see it twice"
keto,Keto reboot after an absolute 8 month meltdown and a 35 lb weight regain. Looking for a better source of trace minerals to alleviate calf cramps...(I have no idea how to add flair) 5'2 SW174,"Sudden intense calf cramps, like you got caught in the jaws of a lion. Pretty sure at least some of you know the feeling.

I'm supplemented magnesium, potassium and sodium, exactly as last keto-round but I never really managed to get the surprise calf cramps under control. I'm assuming it's the type of magnesium I'm using. 

Anyone else out there find a better alternative? Would love to hear it! Tyvm"
keto,Does having cinnamon with hot water break a fast cycle?,"Hi!

Quick facts:

I'm doing 18:6 IF with low carb diet. 

My fasting hours are from 5.30 pm to roughly 1 pm.

I've been suggested to have cinnamon tea (boiling water and just adding cinnamon powder to it) first thing in the morning for a) helping with my hormones and PCOD issue and b) helping with further fat loss. 

Is this something someone could vouch for? If I do it, will it break my fasting cycle? I'll have this tea at 8 am, if I start this."
keto,keto for brain [ focus &amp; mood ]. need anecdotal reference,"the thing is - i was dabbling in keto for some time. lost some weight (around 10 kilograms). but now i am at a good weight for my height.   
So as i am starting keto again now - i am doing it mostly for cognitive improvements and gut/skin health not for the weight loss.   
I wanted to ask - do you feel that keto helps your brain function,focus, mood, maybe with anxieties/depression , etc. ?"
keto,Sated RTD safe past its expiration?,I have some Sated RTD that expired in October 2020. Is this still safe to drink or is it going to make me sick? I'd rather not throw it out even if it doesn't taste as good as non-expired bottles. It's been stored inside a cabinet this whole time.
keto,Slow weight loss is still weight loss!,"[weight loss](https://imgur.com/a/7sbVFgd) 

I (F25) have lost 22 pounds since August 2020! I was very discouraged when I first started keto and I didn't lose 5 pounds in the first week like a lot of the stories I had read on this sub. I felt like maybe there was something wrong with my body because it seemed like wasn't dropping weight as quickly as others had. I was tracking everything I ate daily and I had not allowed myself any cheat meals. I kicked it up a notch with IF (18:6) about a month in. It wasn't until after the first month or two that I began to see a real difference. Nevertheless, I stuck with keto and IF, and I am now a third of the way to my goal weight. The picture on the left is me December '19, and the right is me in December '20. So if you're not seeing the results that you want right away, don't give up!"
keto,I finally have a picture worth posting! **FACE GAINS**,"I've waited literally my entire adult life for this. 

Even longer actually, I can remember wanting a distinguished chin in high school, even middle school.. I unfortunately have a very weak jawline/chin and adding weight doesn't make it better lol.

I'm not to the end of my journey but I got to the point of wanting surgery to help me out.. Before I go under a knife, I figured I'd see what's really under here and what we're workin with!

55lbs down and this picture makes it all worth it

keto,Looking for a fat staple,"I've been doing keto since last new years (SW 290, CW 215, GW 190).  This years new year's resolution is exercise.           

Anyways, I like to eat a fairly consistent diet with two meals a day (read ""I basically eat the same thing at the same time every day"").  I've been eating a lot of cottage cheese because I like cottage cheese and it's very simple.  I'd like to cut down on it while shifting some calorie load from protein to fat.  Any ideas for a relatively simple option to replace/augment the cottage cheese?  Something that's easy to prep but also has at least some texture to it.  Also, I'm not big on shakes, fat bombs, keto versions, etc... I like to go to the grocery store, recognize the food, prepare the food, and eat the food (if that makes sense)."
keto,I'm proud of me!,Hey everyone! So recently I've started keto on December 21st. I've done it before on and off but I'm sticking to it! So far I am 7 pounds down and have shrunk my waist. I also am 5 days alcohol free which is also a huge accomplishment for me!

keto,Keto and crazy PMS,"I only started keto a week ago, so I know it’s too soon to draw conclusions, but my god, my PMS has been the worst ever. Bloating, mood swings, anxiety, sadness, cravings, etc. I noticed the bloating more because I was so hollowed out from losing all the water weight, but everything else is so much more intense than usual. If I didn’t know it was PMS, I’d think I was losing it.

keto,My first two weeks on keto.,"I'm a 31 year old soon to be first time dad.  I weighed in right around 300lbs on Christmas eve, and I've wanted to get in better shape for when the kiddo arrives. I've had trouble losing weight and keeping it off in the past so I met with a specialized weightloss doctor and keto was what he recommended.

[Here's my first two weeks progress! ](http://imgur.com/a/wDoNv9L.jpg)"
keto,Accountability....,"Apologies if this is the wrong place to post this but after a number of false starts I've started this year right and I'm determined to stick to it. I just wanted to post something publicly to keep me accountable as sometimes this can feel like a lonely road.

Currently 35 years old (36 in April) 239lbs with a waist of 49 inches (obviously i don't wear a size 49, because I'm wearing trousers around my hips but that's the waist measurement). 

Was always on the cusp of being overweight as a teen after quitting football (soccer) age 14 but in 2010 age 24/25 I did the Atkins diet for 6-8 months and dropped from 13 st 10 to 10 st 10. Felt the best I've ever felt and could wear anything (I've always been interested in clothes). But over the past decade that weight crept back on and more so as work, booze, comfort eating, secret eating and, let's face it, laziness took control of my time and I've rocketed to 239.

Early last year in lockdown (I live in London) a low carb-ish diet saw me down to 210lbs but as soon as I went back to work that shot back up again. I'm currently back home for the foreseeable and using that time to meal prep and avoid the takeways, chocolate and junk foods I binged on. I've been on low carb diets to some extent on and off over the past 10 years and always find losing a stone or so pretty easy before essentially losing interest when I feel comfortable. I have the opposite of body dysmorphia, I think! I always think I look OK in the mirror and it's only on the rare occasion I'm photographed that I shock myself.

I'm due to get married in September and while I want my weight loss to be life-long, 9 months is a pretty good target for me to get to where I want to be before switching to a life long mentality.

Over the next 9 months I want to reach 169 lbs and a 32 inch waist.

Now obviously that's a lot but please take into account my current 239 weight is after eating breakfast and lunch and while fully clothed (I can't face the harsh reality of an early morning weigh and measure just yet). If anything the waist is more important to me because I've lost weight before but still struggled to fit into my old 34inch jeans - and carrying so much of my weight around the middle is obviously dangerous.

ANYWAY.... thank you for reading if you have. To be honest this post is as much for me to look back on and stay accountable as anything else. But if you have any tips, do let me know..."
keto,So I went over my carb limit by 1,Silly mistake by me today but I made a protein shake and used 400g of milk (I know I should've really used water). I added up my total carbs for the day and it clocked in at 26. I have been very restrictive on my carbs limiting myself to 5g per day. Is this enough to take me out of keto?
keto,Feeling cold but not hungry when fasted for approximately 24 hours. (one meal a day),"Hi everyone,

For convenience me, I like eating one meal a day. I'm a male in his twenties - previously very overweight. Currently about 175lb with an estimated body fat percentage of 18-22%. I have been doing keto for almost 2 years. 

When doing one meal a day, I am typically not hungry 24 hours later. However, I do start to feel rather cold. I have read that this common when fasting. What I would like to find out is if is this a sign of ""starvation"" or some other potentially harmful process. 

I alway meet my daily requirements for protein and eat at least 80% of calories from fat. I often don't meet my estimated daily caloric needs - but theoretically I should be able to access my fat stores right? 

I am satisfied with my current weight (although there is room for improvement) and in the past have struggled to differentiate true hunger from boredom/stress/cravings/etc. Now that I can differentiate hunger form boredom I find it strange how rarely I am truly hungry.

keto,Cheap protein for a keto household?,"My wife and I are back on keto after about a year off, and it’s mostly going great. Our only problem is finding good, inexpensive protein. Last year my small business got hammered, and right now our budget is extremely tight. What have y’all found that works for you? Not at all opposed to vegetarian/vegan options, but I’ve found that all the fiber in various beans can tear up my digestive system. Thanks all!"
keto,Fainting during workout?,"Today I was working with my PT and the last exercise in our set was pushing / pulling the sled with 45kgs on it.

After the second set, I felt like my ears had popped and sound was faded. The room was foggy, I was dizzy and nauseous felt like I was gonna faint.

My PT got a bucket in case I was gonna throw up and he gave me water and kept me company while I lay on my back trying to see it through.

I ate lunch 3 hours before and was just working at my desk for most of the morning. I’ve been on keto for about 10 days now.

Has this happened to anyone else? What’s a common trigger? Anything I should avoid?"
keto,Need help with Salmon Oil dosage,"I recently started a keto plan, into day 5 now. One of the meals in the middle of the day is 5000mg of Salmon Oil capsules along with a serving of whey protein.

That works out to 10 x 500mg salmon oil caps at one time. It feels excessive, and i worry that it may have been a typo.

Looking for urgent input as to whether this dosage is correct."
keto,"Just a BTW: If you're only partially keto (keto foods, but still high carbs), don't.","I don't mean cutting down on carbs and going low carbs. That's good. It's good to cut out processed grains, and the BS that companies try to feed us.

But if you're eating ""keto foods"", every day, like ribeyes, copious amounts of butter, bacon, etc, but NOT cutting out the potato chips, and the french fries, and still eating the bread, that's just mixing the carbs with the fat.

That's getting the worse of both worlds: you're still spiking your blood sugar from carbs, you'll be constantly hungry (because guess what? You can ALWAYS eat more chips, doesn't matter how full you are), and you'll be getting the super high calories from the fat!

Find what works for you. But either go all in on keto, or just try to eat healthier. Don't try to just go halfway, but not cut out the junk."
keto,Will Keto Rash Reappear,"Hey guys, started Keto December 21st and my results are phenomenal. Lost 4.5 kg within this short span of time.

However, I got keto rashes after 2 week of starting keto. To prevent it from further spreading I started eating carbs again and drank some turmeric tea to reduce inflamation and applied some Black Cumin oil to the designated areas. Now almost all of my rashes are gone. Bad side of all this is that I broke keto and marginally started gaining weight again.

My question is now that my rashes are gone, can I jumpstart hard keto again without rashes showing up again?"
keto,I like eating,"Hi all. Doing my best to keep on ketogenic but my trouble is I have always eaten too much. I like eating. It’s something I need to deal with but in the meantime, what suggestions do you have for food that I can EAT!! Large, tasty low cal keto foods? Whatcha got for me?"
keto,Dry mouth,"I'm terrible at drinking water. I never feel thirsty and probably drink 1.5l a day of flavoured sparkling water.

Reading the faqs it says that my weight loss will slow down if I don't drink enough so I made an effort yesterday to drink 2.5l and I woke up with an incredibly dry mouth. 

How come drinking more makes me thirsty? Electrolyte problem? 

If I could have an IV bag I would. I hate drinking anything. Any tips for increasing how much I drink?"
keto,Is eating the same exact foods every day a problem?,"TL;DR: Can you share your experience if you've eaten the same things every day? (like a bodybuilder's weekly meal prep)

I'm a 24yo 5'11"" male whose SW is 195lbs. My GW is 155lbs. I started keto on January 6th and lost 5lbs in 6 days already! My online calculated calorie need (sedentary) for a day is 2250 and this meal plan consists of 1300 calories. (14g of net carbs, 120g of protein, 80g of fat)

Breakfast: Eggs, low salt black olives and some no fat ham
Dinner: Chicken and broccoli (with some olive oil and ranch)

Did anyone eat the same foods every day like me here? Did you have any bad experience or halts on the weight loss?

P.S: I don't really care much about what is says on the scale btw. I am all about the looks and want to lower my body fat as much as possible."

keto,Low Carb Tortilla Showdown,"My family has been doing keto since the start of the year. I'm doing it mainly to kick start myself back on track from the disastrous holiday season where it seemed like I basically ate every carb that passed by… To ease the kids into a more keto eating plan, my wife got some low carb tortillas which both kids liked. Figuring that it would be good to figure out which type we liked best, it seemed like a Low Carb Tortilla throw-down was in order, and the next time I hit Kroger and Aldi, I grabbed all their low carb tortilla offerings.

With 6 low carb tortillas in hand, we made 6 quesadillas with shredded cheddar cheese and chicken. Each quesadilla was cooked on a cast iron griddle with bacon grease, then folded in half, and cut into 4 pieces.

I grouped the tortillas into 3 categories, White Flour looking, Whole Wheat looking, and Other. The 'Other' category was for more wrap-like tortillas. This wasn't a double-blind test, or really scientific at all, but… here are the impressions of each brand we tried:

**White Flour**

La Banderita Carb Counter (Carb Lean Tortillas)

* 4 net grams
* Cracker tasting, nice texture when cooked, but a bit gummy when raw

Fit and Active Low Carb (from Aldi)

* 4 net grams
* A bit crunchy, nice texture and flavor
* Seemed to brown up quicker than some of the others

&amp;#x200B;

**Whole Wheat**

Mission Carb Balance (Whole Wheat)

* 5 net grams
* Nice crunch on the outside, tender inside, good flavor
* noticeably larger than all the others in the White Flour and Whole Wheat, 71 grams overall weight

La Banderita Carb Counter (Whole Wheat Wraps)

* 5 net grams
* Nice flavor and texture, but a bit gummy when raw (though less so than their Carb Lean Tortillas)

&amp;#x200B;

**Other**

Olé Xtreme Wellness (High Fiber Carb Lean)

* 4 net grams
* Dry, a bit woody

L'oven Fresh Protein Wraps (Plain) (from Aldi)

* 7 net grams
* Odd smell, sort of a chick pea thing going on

&amp;#x200B;

The White Flour and Whole Wheat tortillas were all pretty close to each other, with Aldi's Fit and Active and Mission's Carb Balance, both about equal favorites. Both La Bandarita offerings had a bit of gumminess when removed from their package, which was a bit off putting, but they tasted decent enough when cooked. 

The two overall losers were both in the 'Other' category, with Aldi's L'Oven protein wraps being everyone's least favorite. To be fair, these both might be ok in other applications where a stronger flavor and firmer texture wouldn't be an issue.

If anyone has suggestions about other ones to try, I'd love to see what else is our there. Any low carb corn tortillas? I have not seen any at our local stores."
keto,Went over my carb limit !,Hello everyone. Today I went over my net carb limit (20g) by 2 grams and I’m very worried. Today is day 9 and I feel very bummed out because I was on a great streak. I’ve never gone over my carb limit until today because I miscalculated some nutrition information on a stupid orange bell pepper hours before I was going to cook it. I like to plan my meals ahead of time on the carb manger so that everything is calculated. But anyways I’m still below my calorie and fats macro and I made it close to my protein macro. Should I be fine after going over by 2 net carbs???

keto,Insulin resistant and keto for 1 month,"I have eaten more or less low carb ( i have  t eaten a potato since i was 16 , and now i m 33) for some years but my weight has fluctuated a lot between 136 ( my lowest , 2 years ago, 6 years ago) and the current 160 lbs now . ( around 2 sizes bigger ) ( after a month or so of keto with some more cheaty days for christmass, mostly fruits like oranges and more black chocolate than is normal). 
While i am happy i managed to lose  around 4 pounds in my first month and i already see some improvements in my face ans the way my clothes fit ( especially in the upper body, the abdomen is slow to lose inches) , i ' m feeling a little discouraged. Do i have a crap metabolism? Last time i lost weight i did it 4 years ago slowly thorouh crossfit and a moderate low carb eating. I kept the gym to 1 or 2 a week but the last year has been very stressful at my job , and i have also been diagnosed with insulin resistance. I'm a bit scared since my father just started having full blown diabetes ( and he's only 60). It s true since the covid hit i ve been training at home and mostly non cardio ( so i cut my 1 a week 40mins swim). 
I guess i have the january blues and need some help with motivation . Please tell me your succes stories 🤗💪🏻. 
Should i look for succes come summer or accept that at 33 i m just at this size? :) I'm definitely keeping on with keto to try to reduce that insulin thing ( also i can't find metformin in the drugstores near me due to covid) and just for the sake the feeming that i am doing the most i can."

The mental balance I have found with keto is the greatest benefit to me, so after a shitty 2020 I had intented to start the new year with keto to get back to GW and a better headspace. Unfortunately, a week ago I ended up in hospital with a significent Osteomyelitis infection in my femur that needed immediate operation to drain out, and am now on IV antibiotics for the next 6 weeks.

I also got about a foot of hair chopped off and kind of did a huge purge of all of my childhood-high school possessions. I feel like a new person! I am so lucky to have such a healthy and fruitful quarantine."
keto,"For the love of god, don’t go to a mall food court when you’re hungover","I started up keto again on the 1st after having a ton of success (80 pounds worth!) a last year ago. This weekend I’m attending an event at a convention center that’s connected to a hotel and last night me and a few other attendees decided to go drinking. Having done keto in the past, drinking carb-free cocktails was easy, and I turned in early. What I didn’t expect was how bad I’d feel the next day. I guess I’ve been accustomed to carbs soaking up whatever alcohol I drink, because I had a pounding headache and my stomach felt worse. Being the only option available, I mustered some courage and headed down to the mall food court for something to eat. 

The temptation to eat something greasy and non-keto was so, so brutal. Chinese food, fried chicken sandwiches, pizza, all on display at a low price. I genuinely underestimated how bad the cravings would be, but I guess that comes with feeling terrible. I managed to find a Great Wraps with a salad option that checked out, so I’m still going strong, but just a word to the wise - if you’re hungover, stay away from anywhere that offers all the stuff you can’t eat. It was genuinely the toughest part about getting over the hangover, and I wouldn’t recommend it."
keto,10 Common Foods That Clean Blood Arteries That Keep Your Heart Living,"[10 Common Foods That Clean Blood Arteries That Keep Your Heart Living](https://www.10bmnews.com/2021/01/10-common-foods-that-clear-blood-vessels.html)

 

Blood flow in the body is very important because where blood does not reach the body oxygen and gases take their place and that part either swells or becomes inflamed

Due to which sometimes you also get disability. Paralysis also occurs suddenly due to incomplete blood flow and also heart attack etc. So if you want to avoid all these big dangerous problems then you also have to protect your arteries and keep them clean as they are responsible for carrying blood from your heart to the rest of the body so you also need to keep them strong and flexible.

keto,Healthy Fats?,"I did keto for a week that mostly amounted to cream cheese and deli meat.  Later towards the end I realized the difference between healthy fats and bad fats so it became pecans and avocados.   

However, that seems pretty bland and unsustainable with either option.  What are some other healthy fats that I'm having trouble zeroing in on?  It seems to me that I don't realize anything else.  Help me think outside the box here?"
keto,"Water weight/retention in face, scalloped tongue/thrush, PCOS","F 5'9"", 127lb

Hi all, I'm new to low carb &amp; keto and using it to manage lean PCOS (not weight loss). I started about 20 days ago with intentions to do low carb (under 70 net) but I did end up actually eating keto a good handful of those days. I am now trialing keto specifically. 

A few days after I started, a lost of a ton of bloating in my arms and especially face-- all the puffiness was gone. I also felt incredible energy. I haven't looked or felt like that for more than one day in years...it was like my old self. That lasted about one glorious week. Then some weird stuff started-- I got what I believe is oral thrush on my tongue (got a prescription mouthwash for this which isn't doing anything) and scalloped tongue. I've never had either of these before. I've had this now for about 7 days. Then my fatigue and major facial water retention returned. I haven't increased my carbs or eaten any different foods so I'm just mystified and frustrated. The tongue + water retention had me thinking maybe it's dehydration but I'm consuming plenty of sodium, taking magnesium pills and drinking a minimum of 136oz water.

Has anyone had this ""swoosh"" of water weight only for it to return shortly thereafter? Or any of the other weird symptoms?"
keto,I’m back! Sadly I gained much of the weight back from what I lost years ago but I’ve learned my lesson.,"Depression is a bitch. So at my worst I weighed 275 lbs. this was in 2016 when I was with my ex girlfriend. Horribly toxic relationship. I was depressed and ate a ton of food all the time. Eventually something clicked, I discovered keto, had an active job moving furniture, and went to the gym regularly. Over the next 8 months I broke up with her and dropped to 185-190. Best I’d ever felt in my life. Gained back all my confidence and then some. And got a new girlfriend a while after that. Then she became the priority. I started skipping gym days to be with her, took her out to dinner constantly. Funny thing is we originally bonded over our fitness and how we healthily maintained our nice bodies. 

So now about 3 years into this relationship, I’m back up around 240 lbs. We never fight we’re very happy together but definitely not feeling good about letting ourselves go. Then covid hit, depression hit harder, and gyms closed. I sadly gained over 20lbs this past year and I was so disconnected I just watched it happen. 

But now it’s the new year, my local gym is open again, I’m climbing out of my depression, walking every day, and starting back on keto. Plus I have a new well paying job. As of today, 1/10/2021 I am cutting carbs and sugars. Just as I did before. I’m feeling good about this, much different than the many times I told myself I’d get it together over the past year. 

My first time around my record weight lost in a week was *thirteen pounds*. A single week. I’m hoping to get those kinds of results again. But I realize I’m a bit older now so it might not pan out that way. But I don’t care. I’m not built to have excess fat. It messes with my brain and my arms are uncomfortable to the point I can feel nerves being pinched due to the fat around my arm pits. 

So here I go. Keto plus calorie deficit plus cardio. I know I got this and this time I will not be so undisciplined as to let it go again. Because also this time around I plan on entering the military as soon as I’m in good enough shape. 

Wish me luck!"
keto,"Konjac Noodles, The Zero Calorie &amp; Zero Carb Noodle","Hello everyone! Long time lurker, first-time poster. 29M / 5'11 / 201 lbs SW / 197 lb CW / 180 lbs GW

I wanted to just drop in a topic that I've never seen covered on this subreddit before: Konjac Noodles or Shirataki Noodles. These are basically made from the fibres of a Konjac plant. I was first introduced to these noodles by the girlfriend who is an immigrant from Korea. She told me about this outside of the realm of Keto, but said they were a very common diet food for people trying to lose weight on traditional diet methods. 

When I took a look at the nutritional info - I was very excited for the implications in Keto meal planning. The texture is closer to a rice noodle than you would normally get in a Zucchini noodle method and it doesn't get soggy when cooking. 

Not all grocery stores sell these, but I got my latest batch from T&amp;T Supermarket, H-Mart has them too. Any sort of Asian Food import stores would have them.

Adding some links for visibility: [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/shirataki-noodles-101#what-they-are](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/shirataki-noodles-101#what-they-are)

keto,Bloodwork normalized,"I was diagnosed with Fatty Liver Disease (non-alcoholic type) years ago and have blood panels taken to monitor. My liver enzymes are always a little high but stable. I am also on psychotropic medications and added a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) med to my daily regimen. My liver enzymes shot up. My nurse practitioner insisted it had to be my psychotropics (that I have been on a couple years) and said I should remove them. I said I would change my diet instead, and stop the PrEP, but stay on the pills that make me not want to kill myself *thank you very much.* He said “well unless you’re just guzzling down plates of bacon right now I don’t see how your diet is going to change anything.”

Little did he know....

Since my last blood panel (December 2nd) all of my enzyme levels have gone to a normal range of functioning. And I did it by guzzling motherfreaking plates of motherfreaking bacon. And I’m still on my crazy pills. I changed my diet and my bloodwork is all better. Imagine that.

Now excuse me I have more bacon to go eat. Might send him a selfie of me doing it."
keto,having trouble with keto :(,"Hey!

I started with keto for 2 weeks now, everyday I make sure to take the proper intake of protein and fat with few &lt;20 g carb. I'm doing extreme 20 min work out for a week now.

keto,Week 1 - weight gain normal?,"I’ve been pretty strict on keto/tracking for the last week. I’m drinking anywhere from 80oz to a gallon of water a day.. I’m not taking any supplements. I lost 2lbs after day one and by the end of the week I gained 3 back... so I’m a pound heavier than my starting weight. This isn’t my first time doing keto. I did it in April of 2018 for about 6 months but I remember losing like 8 lbs the first week and consistently dropping after that.. I’m not too worried because I feel great and much less bloated but it’s a little irritating, ngl...

I’m doing this now for the weight loss but mostly for the mental clarity and energy... I’ve had a baby since then and I’m beyond exhausted always and need to get out of this brain fog.

Is it normal to not lose or even gain in the beginning?"

keto,How many carbs per day?,"Hi all, I have been doing keto for close to 6 months now but I still haven't been able to find an exact answer on this. So my main question is this: does it matter how many carbs you eat as long as you stay under 50? Or is ketosis more efficient when you are around the 10-20 daily carb range?  

Thanks"
keto,"Down 135lbs total, keto is amazing, my 1 year keto journey (buckle up it's a long read)","My keto journey is a long drawn out story. It's been a journey let me tell you. You'll see in my post history 2 different weights 302 lbs which is what I started at 01/01/2020, and 333 lbs which is what I was my first keto journey in 2012. This is going to be a long post, but there's tips and tricks at the end that are cross posted over in [r/1200isplentyketo](https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplentyketo/comments/ktzz3a/staple_saturday_list_of_beginner_meals/girn9z4/) (without the story).

Now the story part. I did keto originally prior to it being faddish starting in 2012. It was a great diet for me, as stated above I was 333 lbs when I started. Oh did I mention I was a vegetarian at the time, due to TONS of food allergies and a medical condition that caused anemia. How the hell did I weigh 333 lbs being vegetarian? Chocolate, sugar, and carbs is all vegetarian. I had a carb addiction.

It took me a year (until 2013) to get down to 240 lbs. I was playing volley ball 3 times a week, ate all the calories I wanted, kept my carbs below 40g net, and lost nearly 100lbs. All while being vegetarian yes you can do keto as a vegetarian. In the midst of losing all the weight I met my husband. I was happy, I was in love and it was glorious. Fast forward to 2016, I had stopped being vegetarian (got a real allergen panel done, anemia had cleared from being vegetarian), had gained 30lbs back from losing my dad and my best friend to cancer within a 6 month period (CANCER SUCKS!), and had stopped exercising. Here I am back up to 270lbs, had severe depression, was in an awful work situation, and again gravitated to carbs to soothe my soul.

The next year (mid-2017) I spent getting my work situation under control. I had an amazing director, I work for the Federal Government, that sent me on this great career broadening experience to the east coast it was supposed to last one year. Within 2 weeks of showing up I was starting to feel like my old self. My new boss was amazing! I talked my husband into letting me find a permanent job here (the director knew I would do this and it was why he sent me). I spent the next year and a half in an AMAZING position that allowed me to travel the world, helping negotiate agreements and such. I was having so much fun.

In late 2019 came the 2 trips that will forever live in infamy for me. I had to travel to India twice within 3 weeks. It's a 25 hour flight broken into 2 segments 11 hours to Frankfurt and then 10 hours to Bangalore, India with a 4 hour layover in between. I had fallen down a flight of stairs in March and had a compression fracture of my T12, so sitting for that long was brutal. I had also put on another 32lbs so now I was sitting at 302lbs, I think my actual high weight was over 310 at some point in late 2019. The first trip was pretty uneventful, but the second trip I actually got to get out and visit the city a bit with colleagues. 

While I was touring a friend took the picture on the [left](https://i.redd.it/xsm88d78wq861.jpg) (pictures on the right was at the end of 2020). I was absolutely horrified at what I saw and I was also horrified on how I was treated on the way back from this trip. I ALWAYS sat in the window seat exit row for more room on these international flights, assuming there was a pull down tray there (arm rest trays were a no go). The airline I was flying on the way back from India to Frankfurt had double booked my seat (window, exit row). The two guys were ass hats, only spoke German, and didn't want to move. My German is super broken but they kept saying ""fette kuh"" and looking at me, I knew the last word was cow and guessed the first word was fat. The flight crew came and tried to fix it but also was calling me a ""fette kuh"". I was horrified, I fought back tears the entire 10 hour flight. Once I landed in Frankfurt I ran to my next gate and broke down. I called my mom told her what happened, told her I couldn't live like this anymore, and was sobbing. My mom, bless her ever loving soul, told me ""honey I will pay for an upgrade to first class for you"". I flew first class home, still with the memory of what those people said and drank myself asleep and crying in the most comfortable seat in the world!

When I got home I became even more depressed and angry for letting myself get this way...again. I had gained back all but 30lbs (even that is debatable) that I lost originally and I was miserable. I decided I am turning 40, I don't want to turn 41 being this way, and I was done! 

I started slowly going back to keto, getting myself comfortable. Stepped down my carbs to 50g started tracking everything that went into my mouth, and doubled my efforts on 1/1/2020 at 302lbs. By then end of Feb I had lost 30lbs, I was thrilled. Then COVID hit...not being dissuaded I added in some walking and light resistance training. I was able to workout almost daily because of teleworking. I had a HUGE project hit in April, where I was working from home 20 hours a day. I wasn't able to work out anymore because I was exhausted, but I stayed keto (40g net carbs). By mid summer I had realized the speed of my weight loss had tapered off pretty significantly, between Mar 01 and July 01 I had only lost another 20lbs. I was losing only a pound or two a week so mid July I brought in the big guns and went to a weight loss doctor.

She knew keto, liked keto, and was happy I was on it. My problem was I was eating 2000 calories a day while staying within my carb count. I started a calorie restrictive keto, 1200 calories, 40g net carbs and lost another 15 lbs by September. I was so happy I was below where my low was the last time I did keto. 

I was noticing tons of loose skin on my arms, legs and stomach. I was getting super embarrassed by it, and wouldn't be unclothed near my husband unless it was pitch black. I decided to go have a few consults with plastic surgeons, in October, to talk about where I needed to be weight wise and goals. I found an AMAZING surgeon. My goal was never to get to a super low weight, but just be comfortable, healthy, and bonus look decent. He gave me a weight goal to hit by mid November, I knew I had 6 weeks to hit this goal. So I went back to weight loss doc, further restricted calories down to 800 calories and 30g of net carbs. 

At the 5 week mark I was distraught! I had only lost another 18lbs, which was 10lbs higher than the surgeon wanted me to be to do surgery the following week. My weight loss doc looked at me and was like the reasoning why you have plateaued is all this loose skin. You hit your minimum without loosing this skin. My surgeon and the weight loss doc spoke, I went back over to the surgeon and he agreed I was as low as I could get without losing skin.

Mid November I spent over 9 hours in surgery having a tummy tuck, 2 hernias repaired, brachioplasty (arm skin removal) and don't judge me liposuction. Total skin removal was 20lbs, plus 4L of fat which is 8lbs of lipo.

Since surgery I am now back to 1200 calories, 30g net carbs and between the swelling going down I hit my goal weight 01 Jan 2021 of 200lbs. I am in for the long haul, because I am a carbohydrate addict. I can't touch sugar and large quantities of carbs, this will be a LIFELONG journey for me that I will never do again. 

Below are the staples I buy and kind of what I eat.

keto,Long term keto Heart arrhythmia,I’m a long term ketoer and read a Vice article which quoted some research saying that those who had been doing keto long term were showing a higher incidence of heart arrhythmia. Does anybody know anything about that research. Should I be worried?
keto,Keto ruining eyes,"So as the title explains ever since starting keto I’ve been having pretty serious eye problems. It started as progressive vision loss in my left eye followed by frequent dryness and stinging in both eyes. I went to an opthalmologist who said my eyes looked to be in perfect health and gave me a glasses prescription for my eyes that up until this point had always had had perfect vision. After a lot of research I came across a thread that said vision loss can be linked to a vitamin b deficiency. So after taking b complex, the vision loss halted and my eyes didn’t bother me as much. But the b complex felt like a bandaid rather than a solution. So after about a month+ of strict keto, I started putting oats in my morning smoothies again and after a couple days my eyes already are starting to feel better and vision is starting to clear up. 
Now i know this goes against the countless posts I’ve come across that claims “they’ve never heard anything like this” or “this has nothing to do with keto, you have to see your eye doctor” but based on my experience this has everything to do with keto and eye doctors are no help. 
Does anyone have any idea how to remedy this? Because i want to continue keto as it definitely helps with mental clarity, but not at the cost of my eyes."
keto,Hitting a brick wall,"Hello all, I’m in a deep rut and am hoping you can provide some assistance.  I will start by stating I’m a 42 year old male standing 5’6” and weigh 273.  I’ve been unsuccessfully incorporating the ketogenic diet into my life for the past 3 years. I would get motivated, drop weight to about 253 then lose motivation or get bored and blow back up to where i am now.  I’ve done this cycle about 4 times in 3 years and I’m so frustrated that it’s making me depressed. I also lost my dad AND my job due to covid at the beginning of last year and I’ve been very emotionally unstable since then. 

When i was successful with keto i only ate 3 things:
An omelette for breakfast, then chicken leg quarters and a can of green beans for dinner.  Sounds easy enough, but hard to maintain because it’s the same meal every day. 

I see so many recipes with all of these expensive ingredients i can’t afford and then there are others that are so complex it would take a chef to prepare them. 

I just need a simple 7 day menu with something different each day so I’m not eating chicken and green beans every damn day.  

Is there any place i can go that will just give me a simple cheap and quick 7 day meal plan that I can follow for free? Thanks in advance for your help...."
keto,Mediterranean Keto?,"Hi everyone, after lurking and learning here for over a year, I recently began Keto. I had a medical scare that has flipped something in my brain and I want to ride this out and lock-in better habits while I still have this newfound commitment burning in me. 

I started at 458 lbs on 12/27/20. Today I am at 433. It’s very exciting, but it also motivates me to make sure I keep this train moving, and to make sure I’m not sabotaging myself. I’ve been also trying to stick to 16/8 IF.

I feel a slight bit better overall, but I know that my current food intake will not been sustainable long term. I haven’t experienced many bouts of hunger. I’m not starving myself, but my caloric intake is averaging around 1100 calories. I’m looking to put together a plan that I can follow so I’m make sure I’m focusing on the best mix of foods possible. 

Because of my medical scare, I’m concerned about cholesterol. A partial artery blockage was discovered. I’m taking medication now and will be following up with a neurologist. But my question is this: does anyone have meal or food recommendations that are keto and support lowering cholesterol and alleviate blockages?  My doctor’s recommendation is a Mediterranean diet so I’ve started to try to read up on Keto Mediterranean. Any links, books, or similar personal experience input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
keto,Keto wines?,"On long term keto, doing mostly maintenance at this point and been cultivating recipes and food subs for a while now....  One thing that we have a sub (or not really a sub) for is white wine, we buy from Dry Farms and that wine does not impact our blood sugar but it’s costly ($159 for 6 bottles)

Anyone have any brands or suggestions to supplement that?  Again we can drink an entire bottle of that wine without being kicked out of ketosis but the cost is prohibitive for a long term replacement."
keto,Need a little heart advice,"I am having some heart issues since keto 6 days).  I realize it can mess with your magnesium, potassium and sodium which are minerales that effect the heart.  My heartbeat is high and irregular and i have had a killer headache for 2 days.  I have been adding electrolytes to my water.  Has anyone heard of this diet giving someone a heart attack?  I even had radiating pain from my right to left and down my arm.  I'm pretty scared TBH.  I am going to call my dr in the morning, but should i go eat and PB&amp;J and throw myself out of ketosis just to be safe till then?  Any advice from people who have experienced this would be appreciated."
keto,Looking for advice on macro percentages.,"  Two years ago i lost over 80 lbs on keto. Since then I put the weight back on. Part of that is because I started competing in strongman and stacked a ton of muscle on while bulking in a reckless way. I also wanted to move up a weight class to heavy weights so I could compete with the best around. So, in other words I trained very hard buy with little regard for gaining fat.

   I gained all of the weight back. First was recovery from a torn bicep in which I missed a ton of gym time. Then corona hit the very week i went back! I still wasn't focused on nutrition and that was very bad for me. My  percentage of body fat is definitely lower than when I first began a few years ago but my weight is back up. 

 Basically I'm looking for a way to split up my macros in the most effective way possible to lose weight and retain a maximum amount of muscle. I would like to know all of your best methods for this. I'm seeking info about macro suggestions, foods that are better than others for this goal, fasting suggestions, supplements (especially electrolytes) and just any good general info about this that anyone wants to share.

  Thank you if you read all this. I appreciate any support offered."

My sister recently started selling Arbonne products and I have never really bought stuff like that but really want to support her... we are both on our own journey to a better healthy us and this was the path she chose. Can I buy anything from Arbonne and remain on keto? Fizz sticks? I just want to buy something to support... couldn’t find anything online so that is why I am asking all of you. Thank you for the help, I appreciate it! I’m hoping that someday I can subtly influence her to join the Keto train.. Choo chooooooo! ;)"

keto,Looking to improve Body Fat Percentage,"After a year of supporting my wife through her breast cancer treatment, and do some basic research into a healthier lifestyle, we chose to adapt the ketogenic diet principles. Now 8 weeks in going full clean keto, tings are going very well. I have reached my modest goal weight of 79kg, shedding 8kg over the past 8 weeks.
Today I recalculated my macronutrients, my aim now is primarily to maintain but reduce body fat. As a keen cyclist, and active person being fat adaptive at my age is part of my ongoing goals.
Some days it is a struggle to actually meet the suggested protein and or fat intake, but I'm still not hungry and still feeling good.  
Any thoughts on tweaking the macro's to reduce my body fat percentage?

Cheers

keto,Keto headache,Hi guys. Last time on Keto I didn’t see many headaches but this time I have a constant dull headache at the back of my head. Any tips on how to stop these? I do put salt in all my food (maybe not enough) and I cook with MCT oil however last time I did have it in my coffee as well so I’m going to adapt that back but does anyone have any other tips? Going on 5 days now :(
keto,"Anyone got to the conclusion you don't ""need"" extra magnesium?","I've tried glycinate and then malate. Both make me crash hard well before my actual sleep time and make me wake up groggy and stay that way until early-mid morning.

keto,How to deal with the constant prepping,"How do you guys deal with the constant prepping of figuring out what to eat and figuring out all of your macros on a daily basis? 

I really want to jump back in to doing keto but I have a hard time with figuring out what to eat everyday. I want to do meal prepping as that seems to be the best way for me to do keto. However I'm a terrible cook and I dont really know how to prepare a week worth of food and to make sure how to fit it with all my macros. 

I'm curious to know what you guys tend to eat on a weekly basis and can share some insight for me. With all the recipes and stuff online, its hard to get it within my macros. Most recipes I see tend to have was less calories and fat then what the keto calculator says i need. I'm kind of an idiot when It comes to cooking so if someone can point me to the right direction, that'd be great.

Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks"

I am a 40 year old male 5’10. Over the last three months I shot up to 235 from 200lbs. I stopped drinking 32 days ago...I was up to 750ml of vodka a day and didn’t leave my house. I was told I need to be around 185lbs. I’m not sure where to start with this diet.

I have heard of it being drank with just ice water but since I have no idea of its taste would like to have something on hand in case Im not in to the flavour.

I'm doing keto for anti-inflammatory purposes and since starting keto my blood pressure is up 8-20pts on average. At first my sodium was low(yes low sodium causes high blood pressure). I also increased my calorie intake by 100% but Im still losing weight.

keto,Keto and inflammation,"I (44F) recently restarted keto after getting lazy in quarantine. I've lifted heavy throughout lockdown, but really wasn't watching my food intake or cardio and gained some fat. 

I've been low carb or keto most of my 30s and 40s so this WOE is not new to me. But this time, I feel like hell. Beyond normal keto flu, which I'm used to,  my osteoarthritis pain has skyrocketed in the past two weeks. I can barely lift. I can tell I'm losing weight, even my face looks different, but man oh man I am a giant ball of inflammation, swollen joints and stiffness and I'm absolutely exhausted. 

I backed off on IF a bit (from OMAD to 16:8), in case the combination of IF and keto was stressing my system, and I already take supplements including magnesium. I'm sleeping more and cut out alcohol, and my diet is clean and approximately 1200-1500 calories per day. 

Any other folks (especially older folks) experience this? Maybe just a super aggressive keto flu? Any suggestions are welcome!"
keto,Wear the same size over 40 lb loss?,"I'm a little frustrated. Not on the verge of quitting or anything like that. But I've gone from 244 to 204 pounds in the last four months, and while a few pairs of pants are too loose, for the most part, I still fit in all my prior clothes. In particular, a size 16 pair of jeans that about killed me, but I could get on at the start of my weight loss journey, are a lot more comfortable, but not too loose at all. They even sometimes still feel tight when I'm bloated or just after eating. 

Again, I'm in this and not posting just to whine. But I struggle not being able to see any changes most of the time, very few people have noticed, and my clothes still fit. And while I know that at a higher weight it takes more time for changes to be observable, this seems kind of ridiculous. 

Anyone else struggling to see changes or signs of changes for a while?"
keto,Addicted to Food and need to lose weight but I don't know how to overcome it,"Hello there,

I've always ate a ton of food growing up and transitioning into adulthood I began gorge eating. My job has always been my load balancing factor because it requires me to be in shape. But for the past few years I've been clinically depressed and tons of anxiety to where I lost all motivation to work out and stay in shape, and my gorge eating has gotten worse. To the point where I gorge one night, instantly regret it and say I'm not doing this anymore, but the next day I'm back at it. I used to float around 190-210, bouncing back and forth between gaining weight  and then losing it to stay in shape. But over the last 3 years I've put on more weight. I'm at 285 right now, its super uncomfortable, and I can tell its tearing me down.

I know how to research online to find answers, I'll admit I haven't done much on research prior to asking here, but I like the idea of a Keto diet to help me get back into shape. It's not sustainable for me I don't think because I love carb foods, so complete lifestyle change I don't see happening. But I want to try a Keto diet and see if I can use it to lose weight, and at the end try to keep a portion of my meals Keto instead of just falling back into eating super unhealthy. 

Anyways, sorry for the rant, I really just wanted to ask for resources to healthy recipes. Or your favorite recipes that are good for you, taste good and are simple to make. Thanks for any help, I don't normally reach out for help, but I figured I give it a try because I'm struggling a bit. 

Thanks!"

keto,Confused with protein macros,"Hey everyone. The calculator gives me 20g carbs 81gr protein 88gr fat for 1200 calories. Which is 7% carbs 27% protein and 66% fat. This subreddit recommended not receding the macros for carbs and fat while the protein is the minimal amount you should eat. BUT I also hear that your body will turn excess protein to glucose and kick you out of ketosis. I’m confused on what macros I should eat for protein and fat. 

I decided to do keto for weight loss. I have pcos and have extreme difficulty losing weight. 160cm, 62kg. I have a fairly small frame so my goal weight is 50kg and I’d like to achieve this till the summer for my brother’s wedding.

keto,Recommendation on Recipe/Meal Prep Books,"Hello, recently my mother has been dealing with chronic hemorrhoids and constipation. After checking with her doctor, he told her she must stay away from dairy products, flour, pastas, super salty foods, and coffee. Pretty much regular staples of her current diet. 

A big problem of her diet isn't her will to change, but rather she is very much a creature of habit, what she knows, and convenience. She doesn't have the first clue of what to eat that doesn't include those things that the doctor has told her to stay away from.

After doing some research, I feel Keto might be a great option for her and helping her shift to healthier eating habits as they stay away from those kinds of foods/recipes for the most part. I've actively tried to find recipe books, but there's SOO MANY OF THEM its overwhelming to be honest.

Was hoping for any recommendations anyone on here might have. Especially on simplified recipe instructions, meal preps, and easy to read/follow."

keto,What carb manager is the best,I’ve been doing the keto diet for three weeks. I have only dropped 5 pounds so I’m figuring I’m doing something wrong.

keto,Hit a plateau on Keto. Need advice.,"I'm 44/F/5'2""/160lbs - my goal weight is 130lbs but I feel that I will stop when I feel happy with and healthier with how I look. I've been doing keto for about 8 weeks now. Where I live is under strict lockdown and there are long lines at the grocery store which I do not want to risk. I get catered Keto meals where all the macros are balanced out and the calories are under 1300 a day, many around 1100 - because I cannot trust myself to do it. I have stuck to the diet, and I test for ketosis twice a day. I am doing it with intermittent fasting so there are no calories consumed between 8pm and 12 noon.

I went from 175lbs to around 160 quickly. But for the last 4 weeks I have plateaued. I cannot seem to crack the 150s and it is causing me to lose my motivation. I feel that if I can just see a ""159"" on the scale it would give me the motivation to keep pushing. These catered meals are expensive too ($130-$150/week) and it weighs down on my wallet as well.

I have upped my exercise - which during this lockdown just involves longer, faster walks and yoga (I cannot do anything more intensive due to an over extended MCL and a torn rotator cuff which I have been waiting for surgery for over a year).

If anyone has any tips as to how I can jumpstart the weight loss again, that would be wonderful, just keeping in mind that my resources are limited due to the lockdown. I should mention that I am taking medication for low thyroid and a water pill for high blood pressure. I was diagnosed as mildly diabetic which is why I started Keto in the first place (6.7) although being on Keto has dropped it to a normal 4.5 so I am not taking any medication for it. My primary goal is to stave off diabetes and to hopefully get off my blood pressure meds."

keto,8 kilos in 8 weeks,"So, keto worked well. It was a pain in the butt, but I wasn't generally hungry. I have reached my weight loss goal and am looking forward to switching to the Harvard Healthy Easting Plate and a more balanced diet to sustain my current weight.

I didn't cheat, and by the end I pretty much knew how much of everything I could eat without weighing every little thing on the scale, like I did at the beginning. 

For me, things started to feel really good when I began eating totally huge salads including lettuce, celery and other very low carb veggies with two meals a day. I also savored carefully measured servings of 99 percent dark chocolate, berries, a few nuts and whipping cream or double cream each evening.

It was also helpful when I realized going over the protein macro was no big deal and I should eat until I felt sated.

There are other ways to lose weight successfully, but this, combined with 500 calories a day of exercise measured with a Fitbit, worked for me. 

Good luck on your journey."

keto,Weight loss instead of breast reduction surgery - how'd it work out?,"I'm a woman who stores weight in my breasts mostly and a bit in my abdomen. Whenever I lose weight significantly i notice a difference in bra size (gratefully!).   
Right now being overweight i want to have a reduction - but i also know that it would be a silly idea because Im on this keto weightloss journey after a hypothyroid journey - and i think i should give that time first.

keto,Stevia and Carb Manager Help,Im using carb manager to track my carbs. I was using Great Value brand stevia extract this morning. A recipe called for four teaspoons of stevia.

keto,The weight loss is too slow,"Hi ! It’s my fifth day in coming back seriously to keto, and my 8th month on keto. In reality, I’m more low carb than keto because I have one cheat meal/week. I lost 12 kg, and I want to lose 10 more. But I can’t stay on keto very long. The longest time I stayed without cheating is two weeks. And now I cheated one time since Monday. How can I stay long enough to enter ketosis ? I lose weight, but it’s very slow and I want it to be faster."
keto,Keto Egg Cream,"A lot of people have never had an egg cream but its essentially a fizzy milkshake. It hits the same exact sweet tooth cravings for me. I never see egg creams mentioned in the keto world though so I figured I'd spread the word.

Essentially all an egg cream is is seltzer, milk or half and half and optional flavor syrup.

The wonder of it is that the seltzer makes it such a light and fluffy beverage that you barely need any milk or syrup to make something delicious and sweet.

Anyway here's what I usually make although there are a million options for syrups:

In a 12oz glass I add 1/4 cup of half and half (6g fat, 2g carbs), then mix in about a tablespoon of syrup. I like Hershey's Lite Chocolate syrup, just a tablespoon(0g fat, 6g carbs). Then all you do is top it off with seltzer and continually stir. You want really cold seltzer if possible to get just the right consistency but its hard to go wrong. There's really no measuring the seltzer because its just gonna foam up and go wild as you stir.

That's it. Now you have something filling that hits your sweet tooth with about 8g of carbs total. Not keto superfood by any means but its helped me avoid far, far worse foods by killing off a craving and its basically a bunch of air which makes it much more filling than you'd expect considering just how little stuff is actually in it."
keto,Ketosis may be more resilient than portrayed,"So many of the guides had me believing that it was super easy to fall out of ketosis.  Go above 50g of vegetables, use the wrong sweetener, eat too much meat.

I've done all of these and am still in ketosis, although according to my breath meter, the ketosis diminished, it didn't go away so getting it back in full swing again is just a matter of going back to the plan.  But I won't have to go through the keto flu or anything like that.  


I had a few cheat days recently, where I had a cheesecake factory Santa Fe salad (Dinner size not lunch), and a cheesecake factory carrot cake, along with the large halal platter for lunch.  The carrot cake if anything should have broken me out of keto, but it didn't.  I also went to PF Changs and had 8 dumplings, a cocktail, and spicy chicken (no rice) still in ketosis the next day.  I had been thinking the wrapper of the dumplings were flour and would knock me out of ketosis, but they did not.  This is good because I love potstickers.  


Also, they say not to eat too much meat, but I've had a couple of days, like Christmas eve and Christmas, where I spent the entire two days munching on Jack links.  Didn't mess up my ketosis.  Actually, I saw an article that meat doesn't spike your glucose nearly as much if you are keto-adapted.  The huge spike that everyone references are people who are on a standard diet.  The study just assumed it was the same for everyone.  It didn't hurt that the mean was high in fat.

So yea.  I'm sure there is a breaking point somewhere, but ketosis seems more resilient than portrayed, at least if you are keto-adapted.  Maybe it is still pretty easy to lose before keto adapted."

I have checked the calculator out, and tried to put myself at a 20% deficit. I’m supposed to eat 1,347 calories. So it’s not a huge difference from 1,200! 

I’m also fasting 18:6 and occasionally go to the gym. 

I prioritize my proteins &gt; fat, and I stay under 20g of carbs. 

Thanks!"
keto,Hi guys! I’m a 16 year old boy and I got some questions about keto,"I was wondering if it was right to me getting involved in this diet, my mom tells me that I’m growing so I shouldn’t get involved on it, but my father says that it will help me very much, I agree with both of them in a kind of way, but don’t really know what to do I would like to hear your opinions. 

Extra information about me

*I do exercise everyday (like 1 hour per day)
*My average weight: 66 kg.
*My height: 1.76 m.
*Don’t know if this is important but I study a lot, I’m in high school"
keto,My Keto Story: 17 year old!,"I’ve noticed that most of this subreddit is mostly adults so I figured this story would be a breath of fresh air to you guys. 

I started July 21st 2020, I had gained weight over the pandemic. I was 5’9 and 187 pounds, sure I wasn’t fat by any means but I knew I could be better. I struggled trying to eat better, and i’d always last a good week of eating clean before I would fall apart all over again.

Then I discovered keto.

I figured I had nothing to lose and would try this “fad diet” as it was commonly referred to me by many. I did not expect to fall in love with my new diet and unexpectedly became committed! I completely cut out all high carb foods, sugar, and anything related to junk food. I haven’t had any foods like that since July 21st, 2020. 

It’s now January 7th, 2021, and I am now 162 pounds, I’ve put on a good amount of muscle, and I am much healthier and happier! My confidence has skyrocketed and now I have people asking ME for help on their fitness journeys, it’s amazing. 

Keto not only taught me how to be healthier, but how to cook and bake healthy for myself too (my keto donuts and keto cheesecake are delicious if i do say so myself)! 

It took me over five months to get where I am now, and I stress to all of you struggling with keto: be patient! I promise you as soon as you begin to see even the tiniest of results, your whole demeanor will change! 

Thank you for your time. :)

keto,Mission Carb Balance Tortillas- Cholesterol Increase?,"Just had my bloods done and my cholesterol went up to 250 from 215ish where it had been steady the past few years. I’ve always been on and off of keto the last few years but the one thing I’ve been eating a lot of the last several months is the Mission Carb Balance tortillas which contain hydrogenated oil (probably eat 1-2 a day, even when not on keto). I normally try to avoid eating vegetable oil, even when I’m not on keto so I’m wondering if this is causing a problem. Has anyone else seen changes to cholesterol from adding these to your diet?"
keto,Call me crazy but I love Enlightened Cheesecakes,"I know I could just make my own cheesecake but you know what, I make a lot of recipes so it’s nice to not have to make one and just be able to grab and go. My main issue with keto and staying to it has been finding foods that are easy to make and taste good enough that I would eat them even if I wasn’t on keto and dessert is a hard one for me since I could basically give up any food, but sweets are my addiction. And I really liked the Enlightened Cheescake and would recommend if you are willing to pay a little extra for ease or don’t feel like making cheesecake."
keto,Waffles!,"Hey all,
     I just restarted keto again, I went off the rails at the beginning of Covid, and I have been looking for a good keto / protein waffle recipe. I made some today that were egg, cheese and almond flour as well as a protein style waffle with some bone broth protein powder, strongly don't recommend, and the flavor and textures haven't been right. I know it's not going to be 100% like a regular waffle but it's nice to have a break from eggs and I can sneak more protein into the kiddo as well."
keto,Digestive Enzymes,"I've been doing keto since this summer and rather than experience constipation, I experienced diarrhea. It subsided as I continued on in my journey. However, it is now starting to happen again shortly after I eat. Based on my research this is can be associated with fat malabsorption. It was suggested to me to introduce a digestive enzyme specifically geared toward a fat breakdown. What do you all suggest?"
keto,What motivates you to stay on track during Covid times?,"Hi there,

I've been trying so hard to get back on track with keto which I love, in 2019 i shed 34kg with it and felt great. I thought I would never have a fall back again, it gave me so much confidence. 

Then covid happened. Most of the time i still do good but i have so so many off/cheat days that it's really starting to show. I realized what motivated me  the most before covid was looking good in my clothes when I went out to socialize - something that made me feel so good in my skin but currently this doesn't happen. 

I know this is a very shallow reason to keep me motivated and I want to change that. I know 'how' to do keto and it wasn't all that hard when i stuck to it - i went a full 6 months without a single cheat bite that year. Right now though i do 5-6 days easily and then just say 'eh, it's not like you're going anywhere, plus it's currently totally acceptable to hide under sweat pants and comfy sweaters'.' - how about you have that beer and order delivery? .. which results in a few days of carb loading, before going back to it.

Is anyone else struggling and how do you fight the temptation to be lazy?"
keto,Potassium and anxiety in my belly,"Hello,
I noticed an increase in anxiety - or really, a tight unhappy feeling in my belly that felt like anxiety even though I wasn’t consciously especially worried about anything) about when I started keto. I was following this sub so I was using lite salt and ketoade. I didn’t want it to be to related and the timing also matched with going back to work (teacher) so I tried other things and nothing worked. Then I admitted to myself it might be diet-related and tried to increase my electrolytes. But if anything it made it worse.

Finally it occurred to me that I might be getting too MUCH potassium from the combination of food, using lite salt on food, and using lite salt in ketoade. I’ve completely cut the lite salt for the last couple of days and there’s definitely been some improvement.

I’m scheduled for blood work this weekend. I checked and in the past it’s included a “Plasma, Potassium” measurement. Is that the best potassium measurement or is there something else I should ask my doctor to include? Is the normal bounds indicated (3.3-4.9) also applicable on keto? This will be first time getting the testing since I started keto.

Has anyone else experienced this? It seems as though feelings of anxiety could come from either too high or too low potassium which is just confounding 🙃"
keto,Newish to Keto,"Hi all, I’ve been following along pretty loosely the last few months and decided to give keto another shot. I did a fairly lazy keto last summer and lost a quick 20 pounds, but after the holidays I’ve started to put it back on.

Thanks for your support fellow keto-ers, lets lose some weight!"
keto,Keto gastrointestinal issues,"I am not a lifestyle keto-er. I go on keto for several months and then go off (usually for holiday seasons/vacation). I have noticed that during the first couple days of starting keto I get horrible diarrhea. Anybody else experience this? 

Not a huge concern for me; just an observation."
keto,YUSSS!!! I'm finally losing weight again after a long time of not knowing why I wasn't!,"I was sooo stuck at the same 195lbs range for a month no matter what I did! Originally ate anywhere from 300-1200 calories a day, did intermittent fasting, keto, counted every gram of what I ate and logged it, my weight wouldn't budge. I even had some blood tests done and their were no thyroid/hormone issues.

I made some drastic changes to re-evaluate potential problems. I went binging for multiple days to shake up my system, gained a ton of weight, lost it all again by fasting for multi-days then put myself on a 1400 calorie keto diet (my bmr is about 1650) and cut out fasting entirely. I started losing weight again! but! this was a short lived victory because a few days later I stopped losing again while putting back on a little bit... but the way it happened was weird. I lost weight during the weekends when I do no activity at all but retain/gain weight on the days I work (my job is active and I do a 1hr walk) This same pattern happened back when I was eating much fewer calories too. 

Then I realized that maybe, it had to do with my sleep patterns. On weekends I got a ton of sleep (7-10hrs) on weekdays I sleep 4-5hrs max. I went to sleep earlier for a few days, now, so far ITS WORKING!!!! I'M losing again! Today I weighted 190.6! (This is the lowest I've ever been) I have no idea how its working but it is! Yay!

TLDR: got some sleep"

When i'm not keto or fasting and just following a healthy diet  if I catch a cold it passes within a few days but whenever im keto and catch a cold it takes me weeks before im over the fatigue and drowsiness and feeling normal again, I then have to really force myself back into keto if I break it for a couple of day whilst sick, then it feels like my body is really fighting me about getting back into it.

However, exercise has become a disaster:

I've gone from Peloton legend (top 20% of the leaderboard on 60 minute rides) to barely being able to do 30 minutes.   I am eating more calories on keto than previously.

So - my question - how long does this last for?   When will energy and performance levels return?  What - if anything - else can I do?

Thanks a million guys"
keto,Very bad experience with MCT oil,"Here is a warning re MCT oil, which is getting positive press as a dietary supplement in keto diets. 

My wife got some MCT oil to use in her keto diet. She had read positive things about it in a woman’s fitness magazine. She had followed that up with online research that confirmed its benefits as a dietary supplement, with minimal negative effects. The recommended use was to start with 1 tablespoon with food/drink, and gradually work up to 3-4 tablespoons per day. 

She took 1 tablespoon with breakfast. 

Within 30 minutes she experienced an acute drop in blood pressure, massive diarrhea, went into shock, suffered loss of blood flow to her intestines (intestinal ischemia). 

She has been in the hospital 2 days so far. Hopefully she will be able to come home tomorrow. The damage to her bowels will take several weeks to heal. 

Just because it is labeled a dietary supplement doesn’t mean that bad things can’t happen."
keto,How much of my weight loss is due to Keto vs my massive calorie deficit?,"I know there may not be a straight answer here. But I’ve been on keto for a year (with a 4 month break) and am 75 pounds down. Clearly I’m very happy, but I’m starting to think, how much of this is due to lack of carbs rather than just eating 1,000 calories a day? If I started eating bread again but kept to 1,000 calories, what would happen? Thanks!

Appreciate may be a silly question but I’m far from knowledgeable on the science of all this."
keto,Keto diet with HIIT/CrossFit,"I have been on Keto now 2 months and plan on keeping it going as I have lost 20 lbs so far and feel great. I was never super fit or athletic but did have a CrossFit routine 4-5 days a week and could keep up with the workouts. I started Keto with gyms being closed and a super sedentary lifestyle so tried to do it to get back on track while doing some stationary biking a few days a week for 30 minutes. 


Now that I am going back into a gym routine with an hour workout 4 days a week, is there anything someone needs to be aware of or any dangers keeping up with the keto diet?


Under a paleo diet, I would eat some more carbs on workout days but with the need to stay under on Keto, is that still a safe idea to have a 50 carb intake on workout days and continue a 20 or less on other days or should the added calories be focused around the fat intake still?


I assume water and salt is still key as well but wanted to make sure if there are anything else I should address shifting my lifestyle back to more active."

I have not been on this subreddit in months since I fell off keto. Last year at age 17 I decided to change my lifestyle and loose weight by eating keto and I lost 45 pounds, I was so proud of myself and I gained so much confidence. Then COVID came and I was stuck home and I found it so hard to stick to keto while also trying to graduate as a High School Senior online! This summer I went through alot of trauma and this changed me forever, I had constant anxiety and fear of being alone with males and I turned for food for comfort where I gained it all back feeling terrible. I finally came back because I felt my best on keto!

My cycle was a bit late and I was stressed but it came on the 3rd to last placebo pill and i have not stopped bleeding ever since. Im currently in the middle of my second week of my new pack, and I wanted to know if keto had anything to do with this, or the simple fact that I dont take it at the time time or both?

I am interested in trying out a keto diet with a 16/8 fast when cutting weight but I also still have an interest in being bigger since I love heavy weight lifting, I am 28M, 5'11 at 220 lbs. 

I hear that a regular Keto diet is more for getting lean and makes getting stronger more difficult because you lose mass. Is it healthy/safe to alternate between high carb bulking and doing keto? I feel like it would be very extreme going from hypothetically 347G carbs per day down to 20G

Thank you for advice in advance!"

Why can’t we completely eliminate carbs? If we do, would that be considered as the carnivore diet? Thanks"

Does anyone incorporate fermented grains in their diet whether its something super simple like fermented steel cut oats or like an ethnic dish that you just didn’t want to give up.

keto,a case for tracking your food intake even if you have eating disorder history,"I know different people have very different feelings about whether or not to track food intake with an app.  and I used to be one of the people who avoids tracking, because tracking can be triggering behavior for people with eating disorder history, and that sometimes seems to be the case for me.

but today I just want to put my 2 cents in the bucket and ponder out loud about how beneficial food tracking can be even for someone who has eating disorder history, like me.

eating disorder behavior can be rooted in anxiety, and anxiety can be chemical in nature.

anxiety can be improved by what we eat.

tracking can help me make sure I'm creating the right kind of chemical state in my body to lower my anxiety.

increasing my micronutrient intake and drastically lowering my carbs helps reduce my anxiety, regardless of what my calorie total is.

food trackers can also help me find new foods that help me keep my micronutrient intake high - foods that I wouldn't have found with a google search.

and my anxiety is *still* much lower than usual when I consistently hit my micronutrient targets and consistently keep my carbs low.  

It's still lower than usual even when I have those ""oh shit, I'm 3% over my calorie goal for the day, I fucked up"" moments (and I do)"

And of course every ingredient is organic their even better if you freeze them! Now in the ingredients it says “contains milk” but there’s no milk in the ingredients so I emailed the company and apparently they are just manufactured with equipment that shares milk products (I’m allergic to milk) the only drawback is I think you can only get them in whole foods or online and their 5 dollars a bar (typical bulletproof)

keto,Day 7 keto. Feeling great - but when can I fast?,"Day 3 - 6 was a disaster. I couldn't sleep, memory was cloudy, eyes blurry and all sorts of other issues. But I stuck through it... and feeling much better now on Day 7. I wanted to start fasting here and there, perhaps skip breakfast or skip dinner. Or skip a day completely. When is it recommended to start doing so? Should I give it another week before jumping into it?

Also, my calorie intake is 1650 for the day (5""11, 192lbs, desk job) Should I still consume the same amount of calories if I skip a meal for the day? Make my other two meals larger?

Thanks in advance!"

I am 37 and in good shape, do not feel any fatigue however, I am worried that because of my genetics Keto might not be the right diet for me and it can be somehow dangerous (my grandfather had the first heart attack at 56 and he died at 82 because of one). Also, my father is very active and do sports, but still, his cholesterol is high.  

I recognize that I eat a lot of cheese and sour cream but still, I'm in my fat portion range. I also use avocado oil and extra virgin olive oil and eat 1 or half avocado per day.

keto,"LPT: If you're on the MCT train (for keto or ADHD or other reasons), there are some household uses for it too.","

tl;dr: MCT oil can be used to oil cutting boards and wooden utensils

this isn't a keto-tip per se, but its something that I bet many people on keto could probably take advantage of.

I was looking at how to maintain a butcher block I have. I didn't want to just rub olive oil or something on it, because that can go rancid. I found that while the most common thing to use is food-grade mineral oil, you can also use Refractionated coconut oil, also known as, you guessed it: MCT Oil.

I cleaned, disinfected and dried off the cutting board (for like an hour, so it was bone dry), put a few drops of MCT oil on it, and wiped it with a paper towel, and let it soak in overnight. I've been doing the same with wooden utensils I have.


I found this https://www.cuttingboard.com/blog/what-type-of-oils-are-safe-to-use-on-your-cutting-board/:
&gt; Coconut Oil (Refractionated)

&gt;Coconut oils have recently become highly popular for a variety of purposes, especially in beauty, because it is rich is saturated fats that are good for skin health. Unfortunately, all fats exposed to air eventually go rancid and coconut oil is not immune (even though some bloggers claim otherwise). However, a select group of coconut oils are refined using a refractionation process, which is a fancy way of staying that the oils have been steam distilled. _During this distillation process, coconut oil is separated so that the long-chain triglycerides (LCT) are removed and only the medium chain triglycerides (MCT) are left. This leaves an almost pure oil that will NOT go rancid, is shelf stable and is superior to most other oils for treating not just cutting boards, but your kitchen utensils, salad bowls, countertops..._ you get the idea.

I’ve had 2 or 3 cheat days but I’m working out daily (20 min cardio and lifting 30 min) and justify having a slice of pizza every 2 weeks. 

I’ve done all of my macros in a calculator but realized that by just eating food to get myself to my protein levels causes me to be full beyond belief. I used to just eat whatever and never thought about it. 

My goals are: 20g net carbs, 120g fat, 120g protein. I usually do about 5g net carbs, 50g fat and 120g of protein in a day but that’s only about 1100-1200 calories. I’ve added protein shakes too because I can barely eat enough to get to 120g protein lol.

keto,NSV - Computer didn’t recognize me,I’ve lost about 40lbs since I set up my profile on my husband’s laptop. I haven’t signed in for a very long time - probably a year or more.

keto,Zero carb vs. Low carb question(s),"Just finished a 4 day water fast and transitioned to keto today. I feel like if i have 0 carbs and 0 sugar, my body will still prioritize eating fat vs using the few carbs I'd otherwise have on a low carb keto. Which if i'm not wrong is under 20g per day? Anyways I was wondering if anyone had any experience with both and if I am right about 0 being better than low carb. So far I've just been eating bone broth, chicken breast with 0 carb buffalo sauce and little steak tips. Flavored polar seltzer water for beverage. I know there can be issues with constipation from what I've read on a few posts here but I'd prefer that to hot brown rain any day of the week. Any advice or tips would be great thanks and happy new year."

keto,Carbs advertized incorrectly? Xylitol? Net carbs?,"Hi,

I ordered baking chocolate drops which were advertized to have 2.5 net carbs per 100 grams, sweetened with xylitol. When they arrived  however, the label said 30 total carbs and 10 fibre, no sugar alcohols are declared. I am in Germany and don't know the rules for sugar alcohols, but I do know that 30 - 10 is not 2.5. So is this a ripoff or could some of the 20 remaining carbs be the xylitol?

keto,Is keto the right way for me to lose my belly fat?,"Hi, I'm 25/m/5'8"" and between 65-67 kgs (approx 140-145 lbs) so I'm probably not in the weight category of most of the people who follow keto diets. I needed advice on whether or not keto would show considerable results for me in a couple months.

Over the lockdown, due to lack of physical activity, I have really developed a belly. I've never had this much of belly fat ever before, and I have to suck it in when I'm around ppl coz I'm embarrassed and more coz it looks very bad to me myself - I came out of a long-term relationship just before covid and I feel I just let go of myself which makes me feel guilty. I used to go to the gym regularly pre-covid, but I'm now apprehensive about gyms for at least another 5-6 months.

I'm not really planning on doing keto long term since I am satisfied with my body as it is now, I don't really need it from a health perspective and I can't commit to diets for long coz of my sweet tooth. But I really don't want to have to constantly hold my tummy in when I'm around people. I read all the posts by people here and I feel that if a couple months of keto would show results for me given my weight category, might as well give it a shot. I don't mind going further than 2 months either, but I doubt I can hold off. This is beside the fact that I go for morning walks every alternate day, and will start working out a bit at home itself.

Please let me know if this is a step in the right direction especially for me. I'm not looking to lose weight specifically, just the belly fat, so I don't mind if it goes below 60kgs or any other number. Neither do I want to get shredded abs overnight haha... I just want to look at myself in the mirror at the end of this diet and at least have some visual clue that it's working for me and that I didn't stay away from my carbs for nothing :)

TL;DR : I'm an average guy struggling with my lockdown belly and wondering if it's worth doing a keto diet for a couple months to lose belly fat for me at 65kgs"

keto,Monster Energy Drinks - Ginger Brew,"I'm a total newbie at understanding the keto diet and my fiance has decided to start a keto diet in order to lose weight and get a bit healthier, so we are just starting out and at the moment he's having about 25g of carbs per day. Before he started the diet he drank a lot of Energy drinks, about 5 Monsters a day etc, and so cutting them out was quite hard. 

At Morrisons today, I found a monster flavour I haven't seen before - 'Monster Mule - Ginger Brew', that's got all the caffeine and whatnot but when I checked the nutrition label on the can it says only 2.0g of carbs per 500ml serving, which was exciting as a low carb way to cut down of energy drinks without him having to cut them off completely straight away would be amazing! However, as it seemed too good to be true I checked if it was keto online and was getting numbers more like 26.5g carbs/ 240ml which is obviously significantly higher and out of the question. 

I'd love to offer him one as it would make his day, but I don't know whether to belive the can or the internet, has anyone had a similar experience cutting out energy drinks when they started keto and would like to offer some things that helped them? Does anyone know if him having one can a day would knock him out of ketosis? Thank you very much :)"

keto,A Question on Urine,"So I'm almost a week into keto, and  I drink about 2.5-3 Liters of water a day. I pee a lot. LIKE A LOOOT. I know this is normal, but I pee super frequently but in small amounts, despite drinking a lot of water. I get the urge to pee, then I pee, 5-10 mins after sitting down, I gradually get the urge to pee again. It also concerns me that my pee is slightly yellowish even though pre-keto when I would drink the same amount of water it would be white because of overhydration. 

My concern is that it might be something kidney stone-related. I try to guard myself from any warnings of kidney stones because my grandfather is prone to them, so there's a chance in the generic lottery. I stay away from high oxalate foods like almonds, and spinach, but I always eat meat so the animal protein warnings worry me. 

Also, my pee almost doesn't smell at all like the FAQ warned me it would smell. Is this because I drink a lot of water so the ketone smell is diluted somehow, or am I too early into keto that my body isn't burning that much ketones to the point of my pee smelling bad?

 I was raised in a house of hypertension and kidney stones so I picked up on the ""eating meat isn't good for you"" agenda. So Pre-keto, I ate a lot of carby veggies like squash, and meat substitutes like tofu, albeit I was also a person with a massive sweet tooth. My pre-keto diet has been pretty average (low even) on animal protein and oxalates so I don't think that could cause some build up of stones. I'm also only turning 18 so I don't think my age warrants that much of stone risk.

Is my peeing situation normal or could it be something kidney related? I don't feel any pain btw while peeing. Is it something electrolyte related? I don't supplement anything too.

sorry if I sound paranoid, it's just that my kidneys are always my top priority because I've some members of my family suffer because of kidney disease."

I had this rocket fuel energy and mood without a slight desire for food or hunger. I was buzzing all day long. 

I’m trying to figure out if it was random or if it was the fat, as I’m thinking. It felt like a high and I really want to try and replicate it. Typically, my diet is low in fats. I eat about 1300-1500 calories a day with lots of protein and veggies. I like volume and eating big portions, so adding calories in spoons of oil never made sense to me.

keto,Keto struggles,"Hey all,

This is first time that I stuck with a diet more than few days.
The second I start dieting I think, why? Why should I starve myself, I'm not that fat, maybe it will just melt away once it's warmer and I'm active enough, why am I trying so hard (if you can call couple days on diet hard), and I give up.

My friend tried keto and lost over 40 pounds and looks great, feels healthier, full of energy. 
That motivated me, but I'm struggling, I see the number on the scale going down but I'm tired phisically and mentally.
I find the recipes online but I need to double and triple check the numbers and it's time consuming and very frustrating.
Just today I followed a recipe precisely, when I went to input the ingredients into my app the net carb was almost twice the number that showed in the recipe. Unfortunately I made a mistake of already consuming that meal. 

I want to give up but I can't. I can't give up."
keto,Restarting- how to avoid lots of overnight bathroom trips?,"Hi folks-

I was 100% keto for over a year about 7 years ago and lost a ton of weight, plus I felt great! I'm ready to restart because I know it works for me, but one thing that made it not sustainable for me long terms was frequent overnight bathroom breaks. I was SO thirsty all the time but was keeping track of my sodium and magnesium, and my macros were good (I was getting to the point where I had to remind myself to eat or I wouldn't hit 1500 cals a day on maintenance.)  I drank a ton of water but it caused me to get up to use the restroom 4-5 times a night.  It was really difficult to not be able to get a full-nights sleep. I was checked for diabetes/thyroid issues for unrelated reasons and everything was fine. 

I've googled this and the answer seems to be ""more salt, less water before bed"" but I had the most insane dry mouth and it was really hard not to drink more water. I don't drink an excessive amount of coffee (and none after 11am) or diet drinks, it was almost 100% water.  

Should I slightly increase my carb intake to see if maybe ""lighter"" ketosis helps? I pretty religiously stuck to less than 20 grams a day for that entire time with a handful of ""cheats"" that didn't knock me out of ketosis as far as I can tell.

Anyone have ideas? I'm older and lazier now and I want to mitigate this so it doesn't make me super frustrated to rage quit."

keto,There is no freedom like freedom from food!,"I was chatting with a redditor from another sub who (understandably?) wanted me to give evidence for bacon fat being healthy. This somewhat triggered the following train of thought that I often think about and wanted to share with the sub (for the many new people joining around this time of the year).

Because of all the food advertising, giant food corporations and agriculture conglomerates, our society has gone to this weird place where we have to look at research papers, influencers and gurus to decide what we want to eat. We definitely look at our doctors for food advice. Somehow, most of us don't take recommendations/advice about other ""basic"" stuffs of lives from doctors. We just ""know"" them. I did that too for so long! This is healthy, that is healthy, this is super-food and this is super-bad! With all the processing that makes food hyper-palatable, we need other people to tell us: how to eat, what to eat and when to eat. 

My biggest success, on keto, over time has been to break that dependence and eat all the meat (and fish, eggs, dairy) I want, eat some seasonal vegetable (or fruits) if I fancy and eat only when I am hungry and stop when I am full and satisfied. No damn clock, corporation or guru tells me what to eat and when to eat. If spinach causes my stomach to rumble incessantly, there is no amount of persuasion on anyone's part could persuade me that it is a super-food for me. 

There is no freedom like freedom from food in today's world! With the beginning of New Year, to the many people starting or looking to start a new ""diet"" -- I wanted to share this thought. I hope you all find what works for you. Choose whole, eat full and sleep like a baby for the year ahead! Love you all &lt;3 

P.S.: I am forever grateful to the researchers/people whose work convinced me to start keto about 4 years ago."
keto,Help with blood sugar levels,"I am new to keto.  Spent 6 weeks being very strict including mostly eating in an 8 hour window. Only lost 3 kgs in 6 weeks which I'm happy with but thought weight loss would be faster.  Then I did a 3 day fast having only black coffee, mct oil and lots of water.  Thyroid medication.  Vit C, potassium and magnesium supplements on 2 of the 3 days with a lot of mct oil.   Towards the end of day 3 my blood sugar, measured with blood, was 6.8.  I'm confused by this including it was about 9 hours since I'd had the supplements.  The person ive been doing the mct fast with had 1.6 so I think we did the test accurately.  Can anyone make suggestions please?  I did lose 4 kgs over the 3 days.  I then had a small salad with lots of mayonnaise and avocado, olives and goats cheese but have regained 1/2 kg of the 4 kg.

keto,Learning Curve!,"For anyone who isn’t seeing huge losses quickly, I wanted to share my experience in the hope it helps or provides some encouragement. 

I’m 46F, 5’7 CW 138lbs GW 120lbs

In 2018 I lost a lot of weight through the grief diet after losing my Mum and Grandad within a couple of months of each other. I went down to 110lbs without trying. I was eating ok, including junk, but I was avoiding alcohol. I was constantly on the go to suppress the grief (a terrible idea and not recommended) but I guess it came out through anxiety which caused the dramatic weight loss. I was freezing all the time but other than that there were no real issues from losing so quickly, nervous energy kept me going. 

As things settled down and I started to feel more relaxed I put weight back on steadily, and that was fine, but when I hit 145lbs in early October 2020 I felt like I wanted to slim down a bit in a healthy way. 

I started keto and lost a couple of pounds in the first week. Delighted! Then my period hit and took me back up, but once the water weight had gone I lost a more and by Nov 13th I was at 138lbs and feeling good. At that point I started intermittent fasting in addition to keto, 20:4 every day and after a tough first week I grew to love it. I was cycling a lot too, this gave me even more of an appetite during my eating window, and I wasn’t  counting calories. 
After the initial loss and despite fasting, my progress stalled. Without realising because I’d never heard of TDEE at this point, I must have been eating at maintenance most days and sometimes I was gaining. 
I went up to 140lbs which felt bigger than it is because I’d got used to being skinny and had a wardrobe of clothes that were too small. I felt like I’d worked hard to lose relatively little and that was disheartening.

At that point I started reading more and educating myself a bit. My TDEE is 1606 so I’ve been trying to keep intake to below 1200 and I track everything. 
I’m realistic about the fact it’s going to take a while to get to 120lbs, but in the last three weeks I’m down to 138lbs, and that includes relaxing a bit over Christmas with Menai Oyster Gin and Keto chocolate truffles! 

I’ve realised the importance of CICO, others will have their own experiences, but for me counting and tracking in addition to Keto and IF has been vital as I’m working with a relatively low TDEE. When the weather picks up I’ll be cycling again which will help and as long as I’m moving in the right direction I’m feeling really happy with how it’s going now, even at this pace. 

I’m hoping that by the end of this month I’ll start feeling a difference and by the end of next month I’ll
be able to see it!"

keto,My 1st accountability post,"Hi everyone 

Long time lurker here.  I'm amazed by some of the success stories I've seen on here and all the good advice. 

I'm starting keto tomorrow (already went grocery shopping).   I have done keto before back in August 2019 but I never done more than a month of it due to giving in to cheats.  I do not plan on giving in as I'm literally one of those people who do not continue to lose weight after continuous cheat days as I've learned.   I literally have to jump right back on or weight will come back (which it did) 

What I'm worried about is being hungry.  I've read don't worry about calories in the first week.  I pray so hard that keto will literally make me less ravenous because I literally get sick if I overeat.   I've already got my macros set up and this week is already ""planned"".    I typically do skip breakfast so I'm already used to at least 14 hours of fasting, I plan on doing 16:8 later on. 

But since then, besides health reasons (I have pcos) I have real motivation to take control of my weight as I'm getting married next year (was supposed to last year but covid so didn't plan...planning this year tho) so I want to look good in a wedding dress. 

I'm 230 lbs at 5'4.. which is fat to me.  I feel awful at this weight and hate everything about me, especially my boobs and belly.   I'm hoping I will lose 80 lbs or more in a year if I'm consistent with this.  I want to look healthy not sickly. I also walk my dog almost every day (I live in a cold climate) and just got resistance bands so excerise will be a part of my lifestyle. 

If there's any extra advice or inspiration stories you are welcome to say something :).

Also this is a accountability post so I'll post every month of my progress.

It took me about a 8 months to gain it back. I have re-attempted twice to go back on keto but both times I have actually gained 2-5 lbs instead of losing any weight! The dairy in keto is also reaked havoc on my skin during the first re-attempt and it still hasn’t recovered. Does any one have any experience with losing weight on keto a second time in such a short time frame or should I give up doing keto altogether since it doesn’t seem to be working for me?"
keto,Keto Newbies,"Compliments of the new season guys, I trust we are all ready to start with Keto again this year, and hopefully some of us still wanna know how to start with Keto. I have found this awesome video that explains how you actually do that.

keto,"Keto fam, I am back!","This past year has really sucked for me. I did Keto in the beginning and lost 55 pounds. I relapsed one day at a party mid july and my life has gone to shit ever since. I gained the 55 lbs’s back and then some. My clothes got so tight, i got so depressed, I started smoking, not taking care of myself, etc.. But i’m officially fucking back.

I know it’s gonna be difficult, but this time i’m going to try to meal prep. The reason I never stuck around is because I work 6 days a week at an Italian restaurant so it’s almost impossible to not eat carbs everyday. 

But i’m gonna do it. I’m gonna go to stop and shop, i’m gonna meal prep, and i’m gonna stick with it. 

I’m actually really excited for tomorrow i love the first few days of keto because you start feeling light and good quick and fast.

Bring it on 2021, goodluck to you all! Happy new years!"
keto,"Can someone debunk “What the Health” on Netflix that claims carbs and sugar isn’t responsible for weight gain or diabetes / hyperglycemia, but it’s meat and fat (butter, dairy, eggs, etc) that’s responsible?","I had to watch the video as part of a winter break school and it really got me thinking if it’s accurate or not. So I’m just wondering if there’s a debunking video or something.

keto,Any Indian or South Asian Here?,"I'm restarting keto from today, Jan 1. I'll do it for a whole 365 days. I hope to go from 85 KG to 60-55KG in six months. But I don't know what tp eat since all these western keto food are not available here. All I can buy are egg, chicken, cottage cheese, spinach, cauliflower. And protein shake doesn't make me less hungry and is expensive. Bacon is not available, broccoli is not available, cheese doesn't make me full, strawberries expensive. If any south asian here is doing it, please guide me. I want to give it my best while not going too hard on my pocket."
keto,"Does being in ketosis actually make you lose more weight/faster weight in any way other than water weight, or is it really truly all just CICO?","What is the truth? Do we have any really convincing ""proof"" or studies, etc.? Every now and then I'll start researching this and the same arguments come up but I've no way to figure out what's real or not.. People either say:  

1. Weight loss is 100% CICO, period, end of story. If you eat exactly 1200 calories on keto, you will lose the exact same weight as if you'd eaten 1200 calories on a moderate carb diet. The illusion of extra/faster weight loss is all water weight in the beginning, combined with less cravings/hunger. 
2. ...or that being in ketosis absolutely speeds up weight loss because it means your body burns fat all the time (without glycogen stores to burn through first), you aren't spiking your insulin much which 'allows your body to release fat stores(?), etc.
3. ...or that CICO is kind of, mostly, or completely bullshit because 500 calories of broccoli affects you differently than 500 calories of soda and obesity has many other factors to it like genetics, hormones, etc.  

So, do we have any convincing articles, studies, or ""proof""? What do you think?"
keto,I wish people in my life were more supportive of my diet,"I am 16F and I have been on keto for over a month, on and off. I've had so many people judge me, including a few friends, questioning why I'm doing keto. I'm adhering to my keto diet more strictly now, new year, right? My mom has even harassed me a few times about my keto diet and it has discouraged me. She would shove bread and chips in my face. I really want to lose weight, but it's so hard because keto is pricey and I'm stuck with lame cucumbers and shredded cheese. I don't feel as motivated to adhere to my keto diet. My mom does get some keto items, but it's usually just berries and veggies. Not meat very often, it gets so boring. My therapist interrogated me about it too. She even asked, "" oh are you going to become anorexic?"". That is such a stupid question. I wouldn't know for sure, but it is very unlikely. My heart is set on doing keto and benefitting from it. This sounds superficial but I want to shove the fact that I lost weight to the same classmates that whispered about me being fat. Please. I'd love some advice and motivation. The food I am left with is so boring and I have carbs shoved in my face all the time."

Now, I know what you are thinking:  ""Uncle BigTex, what the heck is this crazy keto thing and is it difficult?""  Well, for the first part, keto is simply a way of eating.  To the second question, eating keto is easier than a putting together a two piece puzzle.  ""But Uncle BigTex, HOW do I eat keto????""              

Well, read this amazing document:  [The Amazing FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq)   Go ahead and read it--I'll hang on.  

\*\*\*\*\*   

\*\*\*\*\*\*    

You're back.  I know what you want to say:  ""I read it and it is amazing, but what the heck did I just read???""  Don't worry.  I'm the same way with the FAQ.  It is amazing but it can be difficult to parse.  So, allow me to parcel it out to you:     

1.  Eat fewer than 20 grams of net carbs a day.  Net carbs are carbs minus fiber.  By doing this, you will be in ketosis.  YEHAWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!  Congratulations you are a keto'er.  So, 20 grams of carbs is your ""carb macro"" and you want to stay BELOW it to ensure ketosis.  
2.  If you want to lose weight, then you need to eat at a caloric deficit.  So, click  [THIS MACRO CALCULATOR LINK](https://calculo.io/keto-calculator), and fill it out.  Make sure you click the ""expert"" box, set your activity level to ""sedentary"", take a guestimate on your body fat percentage and finally, set your ""calorie goal"" to a 20% deficit.  If you wish, feel free to click the ""copy"" button and post your macros in the comment section and some smart keto'ers will be along to help you out.  But for now, let me say that you want to stay BELOW your fat macro to ensure weight loss.   
3. You need to REACH OR EXCEED your protein macro.  Full stop.  Protein is pretty damn important.    You will to mitigate muscle loss as best as possible, so REACH OR EXCEED your protein macro.   
4. Get plenty of water and [READ THIS DAMN IMPORTANT SECTION OF THE FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_.201Cketo_flu.201D_and_how_long_will_i_have_it.3F).  I make ""ketoade"" with some liquid Mio, Morton's Lite Salt and H2O.  I get magnesium from a ZMA supplement but always forget to take it.  But please understand, do the above and you won't deal with the keto flu.    

There you go.  This is the easiest way to eat keto and believe me, it is damn effective.  Eat fewer than 20 grams of net carbs.  Stay below your fat macro.  Reach or exceed your protein macro.  Drink water with some electrolytes.  Perfecto!!!!!!

keto,High Cholesterol AND HS-CRP,"40 year old caucasian male, 5'11"", 200lbs)

My cholesterol labs were: 
Total: 221
HDL: 67
LDL: 142
TRIG: 59
CHOL/HDL Ratio: 3.3
Non-HDL-C: 154

The doc sent me an automated message saying I should start a statin. I balked because I am doing keto and losing weight which I've read can cause an increase in cholesterol.

However, she also order two HS-CRP tests. First one was 6.3 and the next was 6.8.

Does the high cholesterol coupled with the high HS-CRP warrant me 1. Changing my diet 2. Starting statins? 

Thanks so much."

keto,What is your trouble spot?,"I have been self conscious about my upper arms since I was a preteen and I can admit now as a middle age woman that it might be mostly in my head. 

I have big chonky arms. Not loose skin. Not jiggly. Thick and shapeless. I’ve been at my goal weight for 6 months but my arms never changed. I know we can’t choose where to lose fat, but it’s frustrating to get so many compliments on losing weight when all I see are these tree branches. 

I have been working hard on strength training my arms in preparation for a canoe trip, and I’m much stronger than I was, very strong for my age and build, but I don’t think these arms look muscular at all. 

So I guess my question is, do you have a trouble spot that drains your ability to feel successful or happy with your look, even though you have made great progress in other areas?  And how do you make the mental switch to stop obsessing with one body part?

I admit on the worst days I look at my arms and feel like maybe all this wasn’t worth it. I know that’s the negative internal dialogue that can sabotage me."

My sleep quality has improved (when I sleep, that is); my back doesn’t hurt when I wake up; I am not gassy and bloated when I wake up; my perpetual joint aches have dissipated. My resting heart rate is also down from 75bpm to 64bpm but that could be doing interval runs semi-regularly.

I am *NOT* one of those people who say that the keto diet is magical or whatever and that everyone should be doing it. My weight loss has also been extremely rapid which I am monitoring. I will be getting blood work done in early January to check my overall health and see if there are similar improvements as last time I did this.

So I started keto, lightly. I went from a hundred+ carbs a day to about 40. And now within the last three days I’ve been at 20 or less. And I lost 3 pounds. I, for the first time, didn’t feel hopeless. For the first time I didn’t feel exhausted and sad and miserable. For the first time I felt like I wasn’t starving every 20 minutes. I look the same, but (as much as I don’t wanna rely on it) the scale showed progress. I just wanted to tell someone that would listen and I think y’all are amazing. Thanks for all the tips and tricks thus far, I’m only hoping to go up from here."
keto,From 120 Kg (264 lbs) 99Kg (218 lbs). My keto journey so far.," I did it guys. This is the first time in over 8 years that I am below a 3 digit weight. And to make things more special, I am reaching this goal in the last day of 2020, one of the worst years of recent human history for sure. Below I will tell my story, so read on if you're interested in how I did it! My initial weight was 120 kg.   

After reading a book called ""Why We Sleep"" by Dr. Matthew Walker in late 2019, I got very interested in learning more about circadian rhythms, so I picked a up book called ""The Circadian Code"" by Dr. Satchin Panda, PhD. 

 In Dr. Panda's book there was a chapter dedicated exclusively to time-restricted eating which sometimes is referred to as intermittent fasting (although some people claim these are different concepts). Anyway, I was impressed by what I was reading and I quote the paragraphs that sold me the idea of time-restricted eating:  ""Our experiment with genetically identical mice focused solely on the restriction of time for eating, and it produced amazing outcomes, establishing the idea that it’s not only how much we eat and what we eat, but when we eat that matters, especially for longterm positive health outcomes. We took pairs of genetically identical mice born to the same parents and raised in the same home and gave one group access to a high fat-diet whenever they wanted. The other group had the same amount of food, but they had to eat all their food within an 8-hour window. The mice with the smaller food window quickly learned to eat the same number of calories as the mice that had access to food all the time. In other words, mice on a 24-7 schedule ate small meals spread throughout the day and night, while mice on an 8-hour schedule ate the same number of calories, just in larger meals within the 8 hours"". 

 And he continued: 

 ""What’s more, over the first 12 weeks of the study, when the mice ate the same number of calories following the same high-fat/high sugar diet that in 11,000 other publications had been shown to cause severe metabolic diseases, but within an 8-hour window, they were completely protected from the diseases normally seen with a poor diet. The time-restricted eating mice didn’t gain excess weight, and they had normal blood sugar and normal cholesterol levels. We believe that a shortened feeding period provides the digestive system the right amount of time to perform its function uninterrupted by a new influx of food, and enough time to repair and rejuvenate, supporting the growth of healthy bacteria in the gut. This restricted feeding period is in alignment with the mice’s natural circadian code, which is why they lost weight and stayed healthier. The benefits continued week after week for an entire year (which is like several years of human life) as long as the mice stayed on the new eating schedule. In fact, the health benefits were far greater than the effect of a drug to treat the same condition. Remember, we did not change the diet and we did not reduce their calories. Timing made the magic."" 

 This is what the mice looked like on non-time restricted eating vs. time restricted eating: [static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cach..](https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/3A307794-119E-4DC3-B7142C6F578D988B_source.jpeg?w=590&amp;h=800&amp;1FAB5C22-6A9B-49B0-9256859BB4189816)  

So, I started this new way of eating in January of this year and I did not restrict what I ate, or the amount of food I ate, just the time in which I ate. I noticed that simply by restricting the time of my meals I felt less hungry and I was finally giving my body the opportunity to burn the stored fat on the fasting hours. I dropped 4 kg in a couple of weeks. Motivated by the rapid weight loss, I began correcting some awful eating habits I had, such as eating a high carbohydrate meal at 2AM when I wasn't even hungry, I just wanted to eat. Food addiction is a thing, but I digress.

 In the middle of the year I had an unusual amount of stress in my life, such as the death of my cat (RIP baby) and I completely fell off the wagon. Pretty soon I regained a bunch of weight and the bad eating habits kicked again. You return to your old eating habits and most of the time you don't even notice. At the time I was just going through the motions.  

This slump lasted for about 2 months, but I came with renewed resolve. I promised myself I would do anything in my power to truly learn what causes weight gain, how to lose it and to keep it off. I would not give up this time and no matter what happened I would persist. 

Fast forward to late August I was weighing 112 kg, and my weight loss had slowed down quite significantly, but I was determined to keep doing what I was doing. I was also willing to test different methods to improve my results. Jim Rohn once said ""The walls we build around us to keep sadness out also keeps out the joy."" So I applied this thinking to different diet strategies. I thought ""what if the Keto diet is not as bad as the majority of people say it is?"" (these are the people from the calories in/out channels, btw). 

 I kept the idea of Keto in my head but only implemented it in mid-october, kinda by accident. One day I ate just salad and chicken breast in lunch and I felt good. Later that day I ate an omelette and some veggies and then went to bed. The next day I asked myself ""Can I go another day without carbs?"" and I did. And then I kept asking myself this question everyday until I was 100% in ketosis. 

My weight dropped like crazy in just a few weeks.  So that was my new plan: intermittent fasting (time restricted eating) with the Ketogenic diet. In early november I weighed myself at 106 kg, by mid november I was at 103 and late november I was at 102kg. 

 I don't know what happened, but in early december I had gained 2 kg and went back to 104kg. I suspect I was eating way too much cheese xD. Anyway, I just stayed on track and kept learning more and more about the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting. I didn't mention this, but I kept learning something new everyday about weight loss, weight maintenance, minerals, more advanced things like mTOR, AMPK, etc. Health in general. I think I did not miss a single day of learning something new, even when I was in a slump in the middle of the year like I previously mentioned. It is so so so SO important to keep learning. Because once you learn nobody can fool you anymore. You can spot BS when you read it or hear it. I'm not claiming that I know the ""truth"", but I digress.  

So, back to december. Nothing new happened, aside from start walking a few times per week (exercise was non-existent before -- because of covid). I'm not doing exercise for weight loss reasons, because the truth is, it is not a very effective way to lose weight. In this weight loss journey I noticed that the Pareto Principle applies to diet. 80% of your results is due to diet (this includes changes in gut microbiome, correction of hormonal imbalances, reducing inflammation, etc.) and the other 20% is everything else like exercise.  

So yesterday I ate a big OMAD meal (one meal a day) and fasted afterwards. Today I weighed myself at 99.9 kg. Feels so good to see my weight go below 1XX+ in so many years. My new goal is to start working out again as soon as this pandemic is over and continue Keto and IF. I hope to lose more weight and stay anywhere between 85-90 kg by the end of 2021. But I quickly learned weight loss is not really under my control, the best I can do is improve my chances of succeeding by doing everything ""correctly"". If you read till the end congrats and I hope you enjoyed it.  

Happy 2021 everyone!"
keto,Colon Cancer &amp; Keto,"My dad went through his bouts with colon cancer these past few years It was a long haul for him but with chemo &amp; surgery, the tumor was shrunk from a softball size to virtually undetectable.  One thing I found interesting was the oncologist's take on sugar's role in his colon cancer.  His exact words were ""sugar will feed this tumor"".  Now that my daughter is applying to colleges &amp; looking up research at the ones she's interested in, I came across this undergrad study &amp; thought you guys might find it interesting given so many amazing side effects we've found with Keto. We know the role sugar plays but the addiction persists nonetheless.

 I'm on a journey of keto &amp; then not keto but given my family history, I need to start taking it more seriously. Thanks for being my online support group. While I don't really participate, I am grateful for the posts to inspire me."
keto,2020 Fave Gains and Update,"So today being the last day of 2020, I wanted to upload some face gains!

[2020 Face Gains!!](https://i.imgur.com/VlkHaZI.jpg)

I started at 265lbs in January 2020. I’m down to 196.8lbs currently!!! That’s a total loss of 68.2lbs!! I was able to take my BMI down 10 points to go from obese to overweight! I’ll take it!

I did this by living the kept lifestyle. At first I was eating lots of fat etc when I was a meto newb. Then I found r/keto and calculated my macros and started setting protein as the goal, carbs as the limit and fats to keep my cravings away. I have been successful with a few stumbles along the way. 

I will report that yesterday there was a box of Boston cream Dunkin Donuts on the table. I held strong and had some cheddar cheese and Genoa salami instead!

Happy New Year r/keto! Thank you for all your support and let’s keep going in 2021!

This year I plan on incorporating strength training full time into my routine. Maybe I will finally see some muscle definition..."
keto,2021: The Year of Keto,"I'm declaring 2021 to be a fully-committed year of Keto. To start myself off right, I came up with a monthly menu of 31 tried-and-true dinners, along with weekly grocery lists. We'll use this same monthly menu 12 times this year.  Each week has 1 day of salmon, 1 day of seafood (shrimp, white fish), 1 day of ""breakfast for dinner"" (egg-based), 1 day of pork,  and then chicken or beef make up the rest. I planned out side dishes where appropriate (mostly green beans, asparagus, broccoli, salad).  I also planned lunches, but went easy -- chicken/tuna/egg salad 1 day, keto chow 3 days, Atkins low carb frozen dinners 2 days, and dinner leftovers 1 day. 

This took significantly longer than I thought. I used an app (Paprika) that let me import recipes from websites, but found that it took lots of editing to get the ingredients to consolidate to a truly usable grocery list (being consistent with cups versus ounces, salt instead of sea salt, kosher salt, etc.). I'm doing this ""lazy keto"" style, but if we hit a plateau I can look with a careful eye to make tweaks to ingredients or portion sizes.

All the recipes and grocery lists are going in a notebook (old school) to eliminate my husband saying he didn't know what was on the menu or how to cook it or what to buy. This will let us more easily share cooking responsibilities. I thought about designating who was responsible for cooking reach meal, but decided that was going too far. Lol.

I've also started a spreadsheet to forecast and track costs. My hypothesis is that this system will save us: 1) significant grocery dollars due to less waste, bulk shopping, etc., 2) time because everything is researched and organized, 3) angst because we have a plan.

Once a month we'll do a Costco run to pick up meats, butter, frozen veggies, etc, but with an actual list to reduce the temptations. Then weekly, on Wednesday nights, I'll place an Instacart order for Thursday pickup by us.  That will have me ready to start the next week on Fridays. (Why Friday? Because Jan. 1, 2021 is on a Friday, plus it gives me ingredients in time for any meal prep over the weekend.)

Thoughts? Comments? Questions? Improvements?

Tl;dr -- I created a 31 day menu and grocery lists to reuse 12 times this year to keep us fully committed to keto in 2021."
keto,My new diet plan (hope to get some feedback :-)),"Hey Guys, planning on going with keto again. Goal is as alwas to lose weight :-). I am 190cm and 120kg. I also do 3-4hours week workout on my bike (outside or on zwift). In order to support and induce keto faster I want to start every day with a bulletproof coffee (black coffee with MCT 100% C8 oil). nothing else for breakfast, I kind of want to combine this with intermittent fasting (Lunch at ~12pm, supper at ~7pm and then nothing else). 
What I also want to add are juices (produced by a slow juicer). This could be a mix of Carrot, beetroot, cucumber, lemon, apple, curcuma, ginger, orange). It's about 500ml juice and I calculated 160 calories and 22g sugar (mainly from Apple/Orange and some from Carrot). I plan to drink the juice at lunch time.

Here's a few questions:
- does the black coffee + MCT C8 mix interrupt my intermittent fasting if I take it in the morning? Also is it ok to drink tea in the times that I am not supposed to eat anything? I suppose it is.
- MCT C8, is this the real deal? Last time I was doing the bulletproof coffee with coconut butter, also I ate bad meats (pork bacon) and my cholesterol went through the roof...
- Sweets and sweeteners. Do you guys have any good tips (I live in Switzerland). I realize that sweets sweetend my Maltit for example do also contain lots of carbs... so it basically has to be something with erythrit but does it also taste good? Or should I just stick to black chocolate?

Thank a lot and let me know what you think and or if I am making somewhere a mistake due to wrongful information?

Thanks!"
keto,NSV: Chose to eat keto and not do a Macca's run,"It's New Year's Eve here (Australia) and my other half is currently in his home town a couple of hours away while I enjoy some downtime with our dogs. 

Traditionally when he goes away I eat something that he doesn't enjoy. Mcdonalds is often my go-to since it's close and requires little effort. 

I was feeling a bit sooky earlier today and was really craving a double quarter pounder meal. In my head I was justifying it - if I get the burger with no bun and give the dogs some chippies. I knew I would feel absolutely horrid afterwards but some days you just want to give in. 

I've been at a plateau for four weeks after loosing 25kgs so I am a bit frustrated that the weight isn't moving. However I made the choice not to get Maccas and eat something at home. I know it probably doesn't seem like much but I feel like it's a good way to start off the new year by making some good choices.  I"
keto,SHARE YOUR 2020 END OF YEAR BRAG AND 2021 GOALS,"Ok, let's try to make this a new tradition.

Say what you were at when you started this year, where you are now, and what your goal is for next year.

Also, say a bit about your keto journey.

I'll start.

I was at 305 on my birthday in January this year. I discovered keto in march when I was furloughed. Since then I have bought a smoker and really embraced the keto lifestyle with heavy creams and meats. I have created 2 times. Once for Thanksgiving and once on Hanukah. I have just adjusted my diet and am now sitting at a better but not there yet 255. SO a 50lbs drop. I didn't work out really at all so I can attribute this to keto.

I can say that coffee and tea have carried me through this. I drink Mabey 2-3 cups of coffee a day. 1 packet of Splenda and 1 TBLS of cream. My favorite coffee was the Cinnabon k cups. As far as tea goes chamomile vanilla. 

My goal for next year is to be at 190. I think picking up a workout routine will help me get there. Losing weight feeling great!!

How did y'alls year go?"
keto,My Keto Experience 5 days in,"So I recently began keto as a means of losing extra pounds I noticed to have rested on my face and chest as it was recommended to a friend. On the day, I’m down about 6 pounds. There aren’t very many things I enjoy that correspond to the keto diet, so most of my meals consist of variations of eggs, celery, and a lettuce wrapped burger. I’ve been having headaches the past few days and don’t know if this is a good or bad thing. Is there something I could eat to help with the headaches please let me know. I also haven’t taken a shit in a while (or Atleast I don’t think so) and wondered if that’s normal. Please lmk and I’m glad to be apart of the community"
keto,Being on keto has made me gain control of eating,"I decided to do keto to lose 25 pounds. For reference I am 5'8 and currently at 171. I actually look good right now but considered overweight. I joined keto mainly to lose weight but I didnt know that I was going to have fun and enjoy making keto meals. I love experimenting and discovering new recipes. Most importantly, food doesn't control me. I have regained control of being ready to eat when I'm ready to and not because I'm bored or whatever. It's great that I don't need to snack continously throughout the day to hold me in between meals as well."
keto,Condiments for Carnivore diet?,"I’m almost a week into this diet and searching for some recommendations for possible condiments (if they are a viable option at all ofc). I have watched a few great videos for sauce recipes, but most if not all are dairy heavy and I’m very lactose intolerant. Any suggestions would be very appreciated."
keto,165 lb lost and some new face gains,I am down now from 475 to 310. I went through a rough patch during Thanksgiving with keto. I decided I'd have one cheat day which turned into three and a half weeks. After which I struggled to get back into ketosis but I made it. I'm still doing omad but I've also Incorporated extended fast into my routine and I've been having amazing results with it. I do a 3-day fast at least once a week. The pounds have been shedding off and I feel amazing. I really do appreciate everyone here for sharing your stories and helping me stay motivated. And I'm hoping that maybe I can help someone too by sharing my story.  [here](http://imgur.com/a/4v1hkeV) are my latest face gains. Thanks again everyone and I hope you all have a Happy New year!
keto,Weight loss has stalled. No idea why.,"I began a keto-esq (more equal ratio of protein to fat) and OMAD diet about three and a half weeks ago, and at first, my progress was remarkable. I lost 15 lbs. In the first couple weeks or so. But in this last week, my progress has slowed to a crawl. I have not made any changes to my diet, but I have begun a weight training routine in that time. Might that have something to do with it?"
keto,Question about fat adaptation.,I have a question I’m not sure there is an answer to. I’m at my heaviest and need to lose 40 pounds. After researching keto I realized I ate keto my entire childhood until about age 21. I was a very picky eater and it just happened that way. Will it be easier for me to become fat adapted than others because of this? I am a 59 yr old female and have a very physical job and can’t afford to lose stamina. Thanks.
keto,who's trying to lose the last few pounds? me too...,"in some of my posts I probably sound wishy-washy about whether or not I want to lose weight - ""I'm only doing keto because it fixes my anxiety"" ""I'm happy with my weight,"" blah blah blah.  That stuff is about 85% true and 15% hedging in case I fail because the last 10 pounds is so hard.  My current BMI is 22 and I want it to be 21ish.  I want that. 

I feel ok saying that now because I have a new strategy.... 1) tracking my micronutrients and 2) *making sure I get enough of EVERY single micronutrient* before I allow a calorie deficit. micronutrient deficiencies lead me straight to food cravings and food cravings lead straight to somehow convincing myself that I don't even want it, but I do.  I miss feeling badass.

Anyway, is anyone else trying to lose only a small number of pounds, from one ""healthy"" BMI to another ""healthy""  BMI? What's your experience with it and what's your strategy?  I feel like listening."
keto,Glucomannan (Konjac Root) Powder is Fantastic,"On this keto board a while back, a wise and generous soul recommended using glucomannan (konjac root) powder instead of xanthum gum. I hate xanthum gum and won't use it. To me it adds a disgusting, slimy texture to everything. So I tried the glucomannan and it's been a game changer. So far I've used it to thicken a delicious Chinese sauce for beef and broccoli as well as a turkey gravy. I've also used it to make a low carb french fry recipe and a lupin pasta recipe, both of which came out incredibly delicious. I substitute it 1:1 for xanthum gum in recipes.

Big thanks to the person who suggested it, and I hope that this post will, in turn, help someone else."
keto,Keto &amp; disordered eating,"I'm curious how many other keto followers also suffer from disordered eating. I would guess the numbers are high and that it would attract a lot of people struggling with obesity and binge eating, basically: people like me who have poor food relationships.

 I've been doing keto, IF or OMAD for 3 years on and off, and I've experienced all the benefits. My therapists comments a lot that my home life was textbook for creating a binge eater. If you ever hear someone comment on how they need to ""run to work off those cookies"" and you cringe, or the only time you could have sugary treats was your birthday, your household was probably a lot like mine. 

Keto removed enough of my triggers and bad habits that I was able to eat intuitively for the first time in my whole life. The weight loss was natural. But, I also wonder if following this lifestyle will just continue myself having a bad relationship with food, since soooo many foods are off limits. I'll admit, I miss eating fruit, having social carbs and feeling low maintenance when I'm in someone else's home. Keto has made food a lot more black and white for me, with a small margin for failure, which I'm not sure is healthy for my mental health long term. I hate it when I mess up my carbs and go down the path of ""well, already messed up...""

Any thoughts or advice? It's a new topic I'm working on with my therapist but would love to see how other people on keto have approached."
keto,Any cheap keto meal plans?,I'm looking to do keto but not break the bank. My goal is to hit 1200 calories a day then fast on the weekends and keep it under 150 even though living an expensive area. I know bacon and eggs are super cheap but I can't palate that everyday
keto,Any ideas for what to eat with coffee?,So I just put my dad on keto because he wanted to eat healthier and lose weight. I did some low carb and some keto in the past but I usually don't have the problems he does with replacing sweets. Do you have any ideas for what he can eat with his coffee? like instead of a cookie or a wafer or something. Not really looking for keto cooking recipes since those arent usually very good but if you can prove me wrong and give me a good one of those that'd be great too!
keto,Most low carb tortillas on the market aren't healthy. But think I might have found the perfect one.,"I was looking up recipes to make keto tortillas cause I missed tortillas. Didn't know till the other day that there's brands at the grocery store that sell them. Found three. One is HEB brand CarbSense. Second is Mission (CarbBalance) which seems to be one of the most popular on this sub from the searches I've been doing. Third is LaTortilla Factory. 

All of them have around 3g-6g net carb per tortilla which is great. I bought a pack of all three.

Then I noticed that the LaTortilla Factory package has the following printed on it:
- No Modified Food Starch (which has an ambiguous reputation)
- No Interestified/Hydrogenated Fats (which seems to be leaning toward unhealthy)
- No sucralose (not a negative from what I found)
- No mono or di-glycerides (which seems to be on the negative side...to start with, they have small amounts of trans fat)

HEB and Mission brands have all four of these. So if you indulge in low carb tortillas, check the ingredients for these things. Look at LaTortilla Factory's ingredients as well and report if you find anything on there that's negative. On first glance it looks good and has fewer ingredients."
keto,If you had to eat carbs... what?,"I am wanting to dip my toes in keto dieting but I want something I can maintain. If I still wanted small portions of a traditional side( potatoes, noodles) what would be the best carbs to eat? Obviously chips are a no go but I know that they’re are loaded carbs and carbs that are worse for you so if you had to choose a side that had the lowest impact on your keto diet what would it be?"
keto,Non-Dutched Dark Chocolate Brands?,"90% Lindt dark chocolate has been an awesome snack on the keto jouney. I'd been glad that dark chocolate is known to have high antioxidant content. Unfortunately, just found out that Lindt's 90% and 99% bars use dutch-processed cocoa (apparently they don't use it for their other percentages) which has been shown to reduce the antioxidant content up to 90%. Bummer!!

Now I'm on the lookout for 90% dark chocolate bars/brands that don't use dutch-processed cocoa. Anyone researched this before? Any good finds out there?"
keto,Non-cook breakfast recipes please,"I'm really struggling with my keto friendly breakfasts - more specifically I should say I really struggle with cooking for breakfast! Even more specific, I hate cooking 🤷🏻‍♀️

keto,Question about meals,"I started my journey back in august and to date I have lost 84 lbs. I started at 349 and am at 265 currently. I have incorporated intermittent fasting into my diet almost from week 1. My ideal weight that my dr and I came up with is 220 to 235. I have two questions. 

1. I have been having trouble with snacking. A typical meal will include almost a half a head of lettuce, hand full of spinach cheese and small amount of sugar free salad dressing with 10 - 12 ounces of chicken low salt seasoning. After I eat I am still Hungary and find I want to snack. Dinner is typically some type of eggs. Should I be eating more chicken or salad until I am full? I follow my macros on my carb manager. 

2. I also find my self snacking on cheese / pickles or turkey sticks. Too many snacks? . Is it possible I have developed a cheese addiction? I find the cheese to satisfy me and fill me up. 

With having said that i had hit a plateau for about 3 weeks then over the last couple of days I lost 3.5 lbs but it was because I was traveling, only got to eat lunch and dinner. No time for snacks and was walking a lot. 

I’m not discouraged but want to keep making progress."
keto,Keto and high blood pressure,"Hi all! After researching keto for a few weeks and reading through your stories, I am hoping to begin my keto journey along with my parents. My mother has type 2 diabetes, which judging from what I've read, may be helped with a low carb diet. My father takes medication for high blood pressure, including beta-blockers, and has had occasional mild issues with cholesterol but nothing major. So my question is, do any of you have HBP? Is a keto diet appropriate for those with diabetes or HBP? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
keto,Goose fat!,"For Christmas my family baked a whole goose with apple,almond and raisin stuffing. After baking a good amount of goose fat was left over. My question is if this fat is still keto? Since apples and raisins were also in there and some of it fell into the fat. 
Also, eggs cooked in goose fat tastes absolutely delicious! 😍"
keto,Is it okay for my wife to continue the keto diet while trying to get pregnant?,"Me and my wife love keto and have had real good fat loss from the diet. She started keto to lose weight gain from ger 1st pregnancy and now that we are trying again wants to continue the keto lifestyle (lazy keto) with me but is concerned it may affect her ability to concieve. Obviously when she falls pregnant she will return to a normal balanced diet for the baby.

So will my wife continuing keto impact her ability to get pregnant?"
keto,Keto without the ” danger ” of fat ? - using supplement ketones as a energy source ?,"Zero fat keto basically ( or very low fat low carb )

What about that ? Using a ketone supplement and eating very lean meats or organs and some plant foods ? Then the risk of increasing cholestrol would be kind of gone right ? . ."

keto,Getting Back into Ketosis After Christmas,"I started Keto Nov 30th, have lost 10lbs so far!! Now after some Holiday cheats I am still testing negative for ketones after 3 days of clean eating...

For Christmas I planned on only doing one cheat day, even though we had 3 days of “celebration”. But, unfortunately I was trying to do one meal a day, so when ppl changed their holiday menus without telling me, I chose to eat the food anyway because otherwise I would have had to wait superrrr long to eat. It was all pretty carb heavy- meats in sugared sauces, mashed potatoes, bread rolls....

At this point the first time I was getting into ketosis I had at least trace amounts...now not so much.

The first day back on I had about 20 net carbs, 2nd day 12, and yesterday 5. I think I keep lowering it hoping it will help get it back faster...

Is there scientific reasons why this time is harder? Am I just being too impatient? Any advice to speed it up (please no ketone drinks)"

keto,"Advice on progress...4 months in, down almost 50 pounds","Hi folks, I started Keto on a whim one day. Just decided to go right into it. The losses in the first month were my biggest, around 18 pounds. I didn’t seem to get the keto flu, and had my net carbs under 50g. 

4 months in I’m seeing my losses dip to around 2-3 pounds a week (10-12/mth). I feel like i should be doing better. I typically run a deficit, taking in around 2300-2500 but burning close to 4000 calories (as per Apple Watch). 

I also supplement with vitamin packs and protein powder. 

I do 3-5km walks a day and about 45 minutes of weight training. 

Is it just a case of muscle mass increasing?

So, I'm posting a second time asking for more of that motivation as I venture into my 5th round of keto. Yeah, fifth. When the New Year begins, I'll be getting back into the routine of keto.  I've done it several times, and lost 10+ lbs. each time, in the second round I lost 19 lbs. in two months. Following that span was the best few months of my life, I just got to college and I had never been more confident. Now, a year and a half later, my weight has peaked for the first time in a year (I blame it on my boyfriend over-feeding me lol). I'm here to ask for success stories, progress pics, tips, tricks, advice, and inspiration. I know that once I get going, I can maintain until I've reached my goal, but the part that really trips me up is the first few weeks when I'm trying to kick carb cravings. Finally, I want to say thank you to everyone who's posted their progress and their variations and hacks for keto life, you should know that you're changing lives by putting this information out there, so good on ya dude.

keto,I have created keto hot cocoa!!!,"I used unsweetened almond milk, Lakanto chocolate syrup, added a splash of heavy cream for added creaminess, and a pinch of himalayan pink salt for taste. Nuked in the microwave for 1 minute, stirred, nuked for another half minute, stirred again, and then added the a sprinkle of salt on top. Delicious! I'm going to say it's 2 net carbs for the cup, because of the almond milk. I took a picture, need to figure out how to add it."
keto,Difference in taste of sweeteners,"Hi guys, 

I have taken my hands off from low carb baking due to various things happening in my life...which includes getting MS in food science! I am so happy. So i m planning to enjoy some low carb baking as much as possible before my Ph.D starts in January lol. 

There are a lot of sweetener brands like Lakanto, Splenda, Anthony's, Whole Earth, Swerve, Pyure, Now foods and what not. Majority of these sweeteners are erythritol based with other additions such as tagatose, monkfruit, sucralose or the elusive ""natural flavors"" that are most likely proprietary blends of flavoring by companies. We have also been seeing some allulose based sweeteners. 

I think it will be great for us low carb people to consolidate their experience with sweeteners they used  in terms of flavor profile, likeness, and baking performance. That way, people can find what sweeteners will work the best for their purposes within their budget."
keto,"Keto, COVID, and GI Issues?","Im not sure where to post this because my issue(s) span a few different areas of inquiry. To begin, prior to COVID I was eating keto and exercising regularly (a lifting program and running on my elliptical). When COVID hit, I had to quickly transition to virtual teaching (I’m a professor) plus full-time child care for my toddler. Unfortunately, the first two things to “go” were the exercise and keto. Truthfully, aside from the sugar cravings, it wasn’t too bad. I didn’t gain any weight. Fast forward to October and my household contracted COVID. My primary symptoms were GI related (nausea, lack of appetite, diarrhea). These symptoms subsided a few weeks later and I got back to keto and my exercise routine. However, I noticed that my formerly fairly flat stomach had increasingly become bloated to the point of being very uncomfortable, regardless of what I ate or drank or didn’t eat or drink. I have cut out alcohol and have consulted my gastroenterologist who performed some blood work (nothing abnormal) and prescribed me pantoprazole. I also started Phillips Colon health but I know the scientific evidence is lacking. On a good day the bloating is only focused in my lower abdomen and on a bad day I look about 5 months pregnant. I even referred to old pregnancy photos of myself to confirm. Basically, I’m just confused and getting to my wits end with this bloating. I have read about the onset of IBS from COVID, stress, and other psychological issues but I just don’t know and neither does my doctor. I’m not sure what I hope to gain from posting this but thanks for reading!"
keto,Stress/Emotional Eating,"Hi everyone, I'm hoping for some advice on how to stay motivated. I was doing keto so, so well. I was happy and healthy and just thriving. I have PCOS and keto has been helping manage my symptoms so well. 
But lately... it's been tough. Since like, the 21st of this month I've been struggling to stick to it. For context, I am 19, I currently weigh 279 (I was down to 274 before the 21st, highest weight was 305, I'm 5'4"") I am a CNA and work in a nursing home, and I have clinical depression and severe anxiety. 

During the day, I stick to keto just fine. On my break at 4:30 I eat and then typically would fast until morning. I was doing well with that. Well, COVID has been hitting my job HARD the past couple weeks and it's really taking a toll on my emotional well-being, and I find myself coming home after doing so well and just.. eating whatever will ""soothe"" me and the stress I am feeling, and then feeling remorse and disgusted with myself afterwards. How have you guys broken this cycle? I don't have supportive family or anything, if that matters. I recognize this is an issue and self discipline is needed. I just need help getting motivated.

Sorry for the long post. Thanks in advance for any advice."
keto,More keto lies,"Since we are talking about keto lies, I’ll share my own PSA:  Heavy whipping cream, while delicious in coffee, will not help you lose weight. It will, however, help you gain 23 lbs during lockdown. 
It turns out the calories do matter. 

FYI:  Heavy whipping cream has 50 calories per TABLESPOON. 
2% milk has 130 calories per CUP. And since you (hopefully) won’t be using a whole cup of milk in your coffee, you won’t get all 12 carbs."

I've been here for awhile. I lost about 25-30 pounds in 2020 and I'd like to lose another 30 or so in 2021.

But my little brother is 15, and he drinks a 16oz ""Rip It"" Zero Sugar every day (120mg of caffeine), or a 16oz glass of mio energy (120mg caffeine). Sometimes both in one day.

He drinks them to help him stay focused/go on runs (generally 5K runs, or 12K bike rides). He's recently asked for my opinion on this habit.

Is this fine? I guess both in terms of keto (almost 100% sure it's fine for ketosis), and in terms of just general health? Should I advise him against it?"
keto,1 Month into Keto,"5""11 M SW 195 CW 180 GW 165, muscular build

I've been on Keto now for 4 weeks.   
I have tested everyday, only fell out for two days.  
I do 600-700 calories, eat once a day M-F  
Weekends 1200  
Christmas Eve &amp; Day 2000  
lift 6 days per week

Half way to goal, if I maintain for another month will I see the same rate of loss? or will it take longer?"
keto,Net carb vs total carbs vs,I’ve seen so much on this debate online and am curious to the feedback from the vets here - like ex: today ate (according to Fitbit food breakdown) 28 total carb but then I ate a quest protein cookie which said 4 net carbs but after inputting I was spiked to +19 not 4! Which is more truthful to keto? Do you also deduct your fiber etc?
keto,Is keto a diet or a lifestyle change?,"I got into this discussion with my family yesterday - would keto be a diet or a lifestyle change? I would define diet as something that is good for short-term and achieving a specific goal. Lifestyle change is switching to low-carb meals for long-term/rest of the life.

I am sure it depends on outcomes people want, but just curious to know how people in this community use keto."
keto,I feel like some people are just flat out lying about ketorecipes...,"Like, keto food is amazing. If you tell me you hate bacon and eggs, you can get out of my house, I didn't want to hear your opinion anyways.

But I feel like a lot of keto ""substitutes"", just flat out lie to you. 

Shiritaki Noodles do not taste ""just like"" pasta.

Hearts of palm noodles do not taste ""just like"" pasta.

Cabbage Noodles do not taste ""just like"" pasta.

Almond flour cookies do not taste ""just like"" normal cookies.

Cauliflower pizza do not taste ""just like"" pizza.

Cauliflower do not taste ""just like"" rice.

Do I need to go on? I mean, why do all these food blogs just straight up lie to you? They all swear ""I'm amazed at how similar it is to normal ____"". But c'mon. We're not stupid. Ground almonds don't taste just like flour, and cauliflower doesn't taste like potatoes."
keto,NSV: Thyroid finally at normal levels,"For the longest time I have struggled with hypothyroidism. It was caused by me not eating right and possibly some unknown genetics due to me being adopted and knowing nothing of my birth parents. I've been on Keto nearly a month now, and I recently had lab work done to test where my thyroid is. I'm overjoyed to see they have finally dipped into levels of a normally functioning thyroid! Keto has changed my life already, and I've barely begun. Can't wait to see where it takes me from here!"
keto,Drinking diet sodas &amp; buying a SodaStream on keto,"Hey so I've heard a lot of conflicting stuff about diet sodas on keto and I'm just wondering what people think about it? I personally drink mainly water (3l daily) but now that it is summer, it's nice to have something cold and quenching to drink that isn't alcoholic and that is healthy. 

Recently, I've been drinking a commercial lime flavoured sparkling water (sugar free but has some sort of sweetener) and I've loved it but it's pretty pricey to drink regularly.  I'm thinking of investing in a sodastream machine and using their diet soda flavours to recreate a diet soda and these are sugar free and low carb from what I can see but I'm worried by what I've seen online about the effects of sweeteners. Thoughts on diet sodas and soda streams?"
keto,Keytone levels,So I started keto a little over a month ago..habe lost 29 lbs so far.  Been testing with a blood meter and my keytones have been around .7 to .9. Since a few days before Christmas they dropped down to .5.  Today its .3. I e scoured all of my food for hidden sugar. I religiously track everything with MFP and never go over 20 carbs.  Idk what is going on.  Any advice or comments

keto,Kitu Super Creamer,"I have been using this creamer for a few months, assuming it was good for my keto lifestyle, considering the reported nutritional information. Recently I have been tracking my ketone level more closely as I work to take off my covid weight. I was shocked to see drops in my ketone levels and sometimes out of ketosis completely after using this product. At first I thought maybe it was something else I had for breakfast, but I have tested several times and it keeps happening when the creamer is used.  I an disappointed, but also glad I figured out the problem."
keto,keto pint bars -- did i get a bad batch?,"I got the keto pint bars from costco on the weekend because people on here have been raving about the brand. My costco only has the bars not the pints.

keto,"Goals and New Goals...After 10 months, I hit my goal weight of 210 (135lbs lost) and am now looking at new goals!","Well Keto...I hit my goal weight of 210 the other day and it has stabilized since for my daily weigh ins. These past 10 months have been an absolute riot of positive change and shrinkage but the best part of all of this has been the new mindset. The new desire to set small accomplish-able goals inside larger goals and actively being mindful of them and myself every single day has been the biggest boon to my success. 

It really all started with the relationship with myself in my mind and that allowed me to expand to working on my body. Managing my carbs, running consistently, listening to when I was full, managing my emotional swings to keep the anxiety mosquito or depression kitty at bay, allowing myself to make mistakes, and taking things one day at a time brought me here. 

As I sit here on this new day, I begin to think about my next set of goals. Do I want to push to go a little leaner to build back up muscle wise? Do I want to transition to maintenance at this level? Do I just want to transition to muscle and fitness building without more leaning out? How many carbs can I fit in at this level and still maintain ketosis? How much should I really think about my loose skin? All of these are the current questions, floating around but I know... As I practice being mindful of where I have come from and how I am doing today, I will be able to set my new small goals and the larger ones later. I will be able to hit those goals. And I will love myself along the way. You can do it too! You got this. 

Cheers,

Jeff."
keto,Not making my goals but still keeping motivated!,"I'm not going to make my goal of 250 by the end of the year unless I cut off a limb, but I'm not discouraged. I know I set my bar a little high.  I did, however, start this with jeans that were a little snug and those same jeans are now a little baggy. The same with t-shirts. 

I came across a photo of myself from December 2016 (at 310 lbs, shortly after losing 30 pounds on Whole30). I didn't think I really had visible face gains, but the 50 pounds since then makes a big difference when I compare side-by-side!  I couldn't find a photo of myself at 340, I think I deleted them all."
keto,Keto journey restarted,"Just like the title reads. Restarting my keto journey again. I was on it for three months last year and just gave up when Covid hit. I am getting a tummy tuck in April and just restarted my keto journey yesterday. I don’t want to talk about it with my friends or co workers because they seem to not be very supportive. I am desperately trying to lose as much as possible by April. I’ve went shopping last weekend and spent a whole day meal prepping my breakfasts and lunches for a week. It’s only day two, but I have kept my daily carb intake below 20. I definitely want to stick to this. I saw some people do fasting, 16:8. How helpful is this? Are there any tips you can give me? I’ve started tracking what I eat the night before so I don’t get lazy or forget to track, I will mess up my carb counting if I don’t have an app. I use the carb manager app and it helps but I think some of the foods are off on counting carbs. I guess I’m just here looking for support, my spouse isn’t supportive and my friends always just tell me to eat what I want. I don’t want to be the fat friend anymore. I have never been above 140 when not pregnant. I am at 193 and I am 5’1”. It’s proportioned ok so I don’t look like I would be that much. But it’s definitely depressing."

I hope you all are doing well! I am getting back to keto after eat some crap over the holiday, and I am noticing that my throat is swelling after eating, even with my healthy keto meals. I don't do any crappy keto foods. I just eat meat, nuts, oils, seeds, and some veggies and cheese. I am not sure why this is happening, but I suspect that I am eating too much salt for the amount of potassium that I eat. Is this absurd? I am not really sure what to do. Should I get potassium salts? Thank you for reading! It is super appreciated"
keto,Any cauliflower rice replacement?,"So I am one of the people who really can't stand cauliflower or any variation thereof (the flavor makes me gag; and it's not for lack of trying to like it I just don't). So I am at a bit of a loss, and trying to think of other things to replace it with. Would zucchini work? Or Broccoli? I'm honestly out of ideas."
keto,KETO &amp; Alli? Is this a recipe for disaster?,"So I’ve been researching supplements to take while on Keto and there are the basic supplements that are tailored for the diet and then I ran across Alli which allegedly helps your body not absorb a percentage of fat... reviews say that if you have any fats you will be best friends with the toilet...

I’m intrigued by a diet that consists of protein and fats while taking a supplement that blocks fats. 

Does this then make being on Keto pointless... would you just turn into a raisin and your new home be the bathroom? Anyone have any input? 

I’ve done keto with great success have never tried Alli."
keto,On The Road Again,"Hello everyone! Some of you may remember me as the guy who ran the 6 Week Keto Challenges (which may make a return, stay tuned) and a guy who was pretty active in this community. And then I disappeared.

I got off Keto because of some ongoing health issues and after multiple doctor’s visits, many consultations with my specialist, and lots and lots of emotions later, I was diagnosed Celiac. 

During those uncertain times of figuring shit out, the weight I dropped quickly came back and now I sit here at my heaviest with doctors referring me to a Bariatric clinic...

but I don’t want this surgery. Several of my family members have gotten the surgery over the years but the weight doesn’t stay off for them - and, at the end of the day, the key to keeping that weight off is a lifestyle change.
I’ve already done a complete lifestyle change the past month when I had to go gluten-free. But now it’s time for another... a familiar one... it’s time to go Keto once more.

If I can go from 365 to 220 the first go round, I KNOW I can drop the weight again from 395 and keep it off.

It’s time to do my lifestyle change, and I will love the support from this group once again.

Let’s do this together, my Keto friends! 
Let’s kick some ass! 
KCKO!"
keto,Use of no salt for snake juice,"I have been on keto primarily for 3 years. I always used pills for magnesium and potassium. I was off for a few weeks due to a health issue, but im not back to my regular lifestyle (keto). 

I decided to buy no salt so I could make snake juice. The taste of snake juice is HORRIBLE. Do you typically sip it or down it a few times a day? I'm struggling to sip on it because of the taste."
keto,"Looking for a good ""diet buddies"" app that can specifically link me and another person","I'm not sure that something like this exists but if somebody knows of an app that has this functionality, me and my brother decided we are going to try keto for both very overweight.

Paid apps are fine we are willing to Shell out our money we can have this option.

Then my lunch is tuna or chicken, with 1 serving of almonds, (try to stick around 6-800 calories, then dinner right at the end of my 8 hours I’ve just been doing a veggie of choice, usually broccoli or asparagus.

keto,Back on keto,"Hi all
I did keto for a few months last year, dropped 50lbs. However I stopped because I started feeling a bit sick all the time and the food I was eating made me feel naseous.
I want to try again because I regained 40 of the 50lbs I lost. My problem was eating a lot of carbs and big portions and snacking for the sake of it!!
I need help because I struggle with ideas and what to cook, can anyone recommend a cook book or recipe website?
I really want to stick to this again and not feel naseous. I was quite good and satisfied when I did it previously, felt my appetite decrease. I usually had a bulletproof coffee breakfast/eggs and bacon breakfast, a big smoothie for lunch or a chicken avocado salad and then a meat cheese and veg dinner. 
I’m just worried I won’t be able to do it again :-( I don’t want to be overweight anymore because I’m young (26f) and have a really bad back (from autoimmune spinal arthritis) and being a normal weight would really benefit me.
My BMI is 30 and although I’m tall and my figure is an hourglass I feel so horrible about myself and unhealthy!"

Example:

How much should you be eating per day?

1731 Calories

135g Fats

2g Carbs

127g Protein

* If you're sedentary, we suggest between 0.6g and 0.8g protein.
* If you're active, we suggest between 0.8g and 1.0g protein.
* If you lift weights, we suggest between 1.0g and 1.2g protein.  


\---------  


2:  I want to incorporate fasting... However information is vague on the eating part. How much should I eat during the 8 hour period?   


 \-Typically you'd look to fast for at least 16 hours and then allow yourself 8 hours in which to eat.   


I don't think a human stomatch can handle 8 hours of shoving food in ones mouth.... The stomatch would have burst way before hand....

keto,"I've done my homework, but something is missing hoping for some advice!","Hi crew, hope you're well. 

It's a long one but I've done my homework. I've lost the initial 3kg water weight within a week.

I've lost a significant amount of weight but have put a stack back on over the last 2 years. I did a year on keto and did really well. My main concern is my blood ketones won't go above 0.6 (normally around 0.2-0.4)
I've been weighing food, taking magnesium, electrolytes and MCTs 

I'm currently obese, (90kg/198lb) 165cm tall (5""5)
Highest weight 165kg (364lbs)
I've had some skin removal surgery (7kg off my lower body)
Still excess skin so I won't get to my goal of 65kg, a true goal weight is 72kg (my lowest weight)

 I'm back into keto, 3 weeks in and have been averaging around 1200 cals a day. Heavily restricting carbs (under 20gm)
My macros are 
20C  (7%)
100F (74%)
60P (19%)

Not able to exercise much (broken left foot and chronic bursitis/tendonosis left shoulder) 

 Not hitting my fat target and I'm worried about eating excess dietary fat when I have so much to lose. Keeping cals low as I'm super sedentary with my injuries.

I used to be a Crossfit/power lifter until I did my shoulder. Also happy for some advice on what training I can do with my current injuries (foot will be good in a couple more weeks it's been a month since the fracture)

How do I push my ketones up to 1.5? 
I feel like I'm doing the right things but there's something missing.
Also I have ADHD so sorry if this is all over the place 

Thank you in advance"

keto,Any Links to Articles Explaining the Effectiveness of CICO? Redirected From That Subreddit,"TL;DR Below

My father recently started the keto diet and did have some success. He lost 20lbs and actually tracks macros &amp; cals with a keto app.

You're probably wondering why I am even asking for links to articles explaining why CICO works so well if my father had the success he did. He was consistent and enjoyed the food which is a huge part of dieting.

It comes down to the app, in my opinion, being inaccurate. The protein is far too low and the daily caloric intake is far too high for someone his age, activity level, and amount of lean mass. 

He is starting the home exercise program P90X, and when entered into the app, it says he needs to eat 3300cals a day! I'm in my early 20's, workout at least once a day, and my TDEE isn't even that high?

What I am getting at here is he saw success in the keto diet and has become partial to it. I want to show him that its the caloric deficit, or your overall caloric value for the day is what is most important for weight manipulation, and that macronutrients are secondary.

I lost 73lbs with Calorie Counting, and have mostly maintained my weight with the same approach. But like I said above, I don't think my success is enough to convince him that it doesn't matter WHAT you eat, its HOW MUCH. And before I get too much into the weeds here, I am aware that certain macronutrients have different thermic effects, etc. etc. etc.

So TL;DR my father had success following keto with the assistance of an app, but the app is telling him he needs 3300cal, which is far too much for him. It would be awesome if you guys could drop some links to articles explaining the effectiveness of CICO"

keto,"26 months on keto, almost half my body weight lost.. update with pics","
August of 2018 I started keto. It was the first time any diet I had ever tried had worked so fast. It was hard as hell at first. Honestly it was hard for a long time. I have Binge issues, but I have been binge free for 26 months!
I started at over 360lb. And it hurt to even wake up in the mornings. I felt like I was never full. I ate constantly and I was sooooooo hangry all the time. But I decided to try keto based on a friends' recommendation. 

So glad I did that, now I'm 32 and under 200 pounds for the first time since freshman year of high school. Its glorious to wake up and not feel how heavy my own body was on my bones. Its been a trip yall. A real trip. Covid 19 slowed me down. I haven't lost weight since like February. But I haven't gained either. So Im hoping 2021 is a bit easier on us all. 

One thing I have noticed about myself is that I do not DO outdoor cardio. I did everything but cardio all year. To make that better, I totally bought myself a little magnetic elliptical for Christmas. And the hubs got a magnetic rower and we already have plenty of weights, so we are just going to be adding cardio back in. Fx it helps us with the last little bit and we can get our cardio vascular health back on track! 

Anyway I mostly posted this because new years is coming and everyone is going to try to sell you a diet pill or a workout plan. You don't need it. Just stick to the principles of keto (so long as thats your decision diet wise) and trust it will work without expensive additions. I really hope you guys achieve all of your dreams. But also that you don't waste money on snake oil while you do it lol. I followed keto strictly for 6 months before I added exercise at all. Focus on the food first. You got this.

keto,Doing keto on a budget,"Hi!

I've been on keto since March, and it's been great so far! I hit my first goal of being down 50 pounds, which is fantastic! I've recently not lost much, so I think I need to refocus for the new year and reel in the different ways that I may have gotten less disciplined.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the biggest struggles I've had, though, is that my grocery budget needs to be notably larger now that I am on keto. Much of the things that are cheap and convenient, like bread, pasta, and cereal, are not an option. I typically cook some form of meat and low-carb vegetables, and that can get a bit expensive, even if I don't choose extravagant foods. I also don't do much ""substituting"", like making keto versions of non-keto foods.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any suggestions for being able to have a smaller food budget while on keto? I've found eggs to be very cheap, but I can only eat them so often before I'm not keen on them anymore."

keto,[Progress pics] Keto: a gift the keeps on giving,"First pic: Dec 2018, 270lbs
Second pic: Dec 2020, 168lbs

I remember being super happy on the first photo. Losing 50lbs (starting weight 320) was already a HUGE achievement for me and I got to buy a nice coat for myself!

I haven’t had the faintest idea I’d lose 100++ more with keto.

Progress has been a bit slow recently since I’ve been doing body recomp and I’ve relaxed on calorie counting (I feel very much contented right now hehe). But I’m forever grateful to my past self for trying keto out and changing my outlook in life.

I finally get to fit small - medium clothes and it feels really nice that I wouldn’t have to struggle looking for a 4XL shirt.

If you’re new to keto, I really encourage you to keep it up. Don’t mind stalling sometimes, it happens and you’ll get through it.

Happy holidays!"
keto,Swerve Sweetener,"So I recently started working with swerve sweetener and I noticed something... I recently made an amazing low carb cookie and I made double the recipe so that I can have some cookie dough in the freezer to have on hand when I want a quick treat . I made these on Christmas Eve with swerve sweetener so I just had a little bite today after dinner and I noticed that , that weird after taste swerve has is almost non existent like it went away . I am just wondering if anyone else has a. Noticed this B. Any science folks know why this happens cause this legit tastes like real cookie dough now . I’ve been recipe testing and so far I feel like I nailed the texture , consistency etc the only problem I had was that little swerve after taste but if letting them sit will make that go away I will try to pre prep my dough from now on"
keto,Confused on some of these recipes,"I've seen a lot of recipes online (mostly r/ketorecipes) and I don't quite understand some of them. If the goal is to keep carbs around 20-30g, why am I seeing several recipes that will easily go over that if following a recommended TDEE. For example, my TDEE at a 20% deficit would be around 1750 calories. I saw a recipe that involved a head of cabbage and 2 packages of hillshire farms kielbasa, which ended up being nearly 45g of carbs at 1750 calories (I understand I wouldn't just eat one huge meal of one dish a day, but I'm normalizing everything). I get that's only one recipe, but I've seen a bunch that seem heavier on the carb side, so I don't even see a reason in posting it. Most recipes with cauliflower I find fits that description. In fact, I'm finding it hard to fit very many veggies in at all. Cheese, heavy whipping cream, and meat is my big 3 at this moment lol what am I missing here?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I am factoring in NET carbs (post fiber carbs)."
keto,Keto for acne?,"Hey guys, I have really bad cystic acne and started keto 3.5 weeks ago upon recommendation from a natural doctor. So far haven't seen any great results in my skin and have actually developed some more cysts since. 

Anyone have experience with improving your acne on keto or an idea as to how long it might take? So far (even with the holidays) I've stuck really closely to the macros and am eating healthy carbs like nuts and veggies. I'm also avoiding dairy (which is hard) upon his recommendation too.

Thanks in advance!"
keto,6kg Gain in 3 days real kick in the teeth seems so extreme,"I have lost 25kg from Sept 1 2020. Really happy as I have introduced OMAD with strategic fasting and healthy clean Keto.
Never thought I would be able to do it but found fasting easier than I ever dreamed. 
But for Xmas I have had 3 days off Keto and in just 3 days put on 6kg which is insane.
Back to Keto tomorrow and back to fasting but it is a real kick in the teeth to have such a huge gain in 3 days. 6kg will take a month to lose I know your going to say water weight. But why 3 days to add 6kg and 30 to lose?"
keto,Anyone else been on a bit of a carb binge over Christmas?,"I've been doing keto almost a year and a half now with almost no cheat meals. Over Christmas I've been on a bit of a carb binge, turkey dinner, some snack foods, etc. Tonight is my last night of carb overload with the turkey dinner left overs and then it's time to get back on the wagon and carry on. Anyone else just let that diet go this holiday season? If you did...don't let your progress go to the way side and get back to eating good in the new year!"

keto,Can I Have Sugar On the Keto Diet?,"Ah, the keto diet—a controversial topic among health buffs and experts alike. Is it too restrictive? Is it healthy? What is it, actually? Well, the keto diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet, similar to the Atkins diet that gained popularity in the early 2000’s. The name keto comes from the word “ketosis,” which is a metabolic state where your body becomes highly skilled at burning fat for energy. It’s known to be effective at helping manage blood sugar levels, and many people love it for weight loss. But because it’s a relatively extreme, low-carb diet, it may be hard to stick with long term. 

That brings us back to the topic of sugar, which is high-carb and generally not recommended in added forms on the keto diet (with 4 grams of carbs per teaspoon of sugar, you can quickly reach your daily keto carb limit of 50 grams daily). What’s the next best thing? Sugar substitutes—but we want to choose the healthiest ones for baking, cooking, and sweetening beverages. Here are four keto-friendly alternative sweeteners you can enjoy: 

## Stevia

Derived from a plant native to South America (Stevia Rebaudiana), it has zero calories or carbs, making it a keto rock star. It’s super-concentrated and a common sweetener for coffee and tea. Find it in powder and liquid forms to see which one you prefer.

## Monk Fruit

Newer on the scene and traditionally used in Asian broths and teas, monk fruit is one of the more expensive sugar-substitutes and is therefore usually mixed with stevia. Most say the taste profile is closer to sugar than stevia is, though.

## Erythritol

This sugar alcohol made from fermented corn doesn’t raise blood sugar or insulin levels. It comes in a granulated form, which makes it great for baking, and it’s actually been shown to reduce dental plaque (many people add it to coconut oil when oil pulling!). However, some people may experience symptoms of an upset stomach, like gas and bloating, with sugar alcohols. 

## Xylitol 

Another sugar alcohol commonly used in sugar-free gums and candies, xylitol is LOW carb, but not zero carb, so it should only be used in small amounts while following the keto diet. Xylitol can be used in a 1:1 ratio to sugar, as it has a similar taste but half the calories. 

Wondering why coconut sugar didn’t make the list? Is coconut sugar keto? The answer is no. It has 4 grams of carbs, just like table sugar, and it can spike your blood sugar levels the same way. 

So, if you are thinking about kicking off your own keto journey, rest assured that your dessert options are still open! It’s easy to find most of the above substitutes at local grocery stores and as well as candy and ice creams that are keto-friendly. Are you keto, or do you have any experiences with alt sweeteners? We want to hear from you!"
keto,How much coconut oil can you consume without diarrhea?,"Just wondering, did some googling around but couldn't seem to find a definitive answer.

I know that coconut oil has MCT's which, given enough, will make anyone shit their pants, but for me even 2-4 tablespoons of coconut oil give me trouble. And yet I see people making fat bombs with coconut oil?

Hence why I'm wondering if there's some other factor in my case.

Any knowledge/personal experience would be much appreciated!

Also, as the titular question states, if anyone can confirm that they can eat spoonfuls of coconut oil no problemo, would be very helpful for my own investigation!

Thanks!!"
keto,Is a rapid heart rate normal?,"I have been eating Keto for about 7 months.  It is going great, but having an unusual symptom I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing.  Periodically, my heart rate will increase for no reason....lately it is actually waking me up in the middle of the night.  I have added electrolytes to my daily intake, and I don't suffer from any anxiety disorder, so this is really strange."
keto,I don't know what to do and desperately need help,"23 (M), been overweight most my life, tried 100 diets, discovered keto 4 years ago, was literally the only thing that got me back to a healthy slim weight, never felt physically and mentally better in my life.

Then I became a yo-yo dieter. I would do keto for a few months, go back to a healthy weight, say to myself ""ok I can go back to eating normal, but I just need to limit my carbs"" but then the carbs just creep up until I'm eating no differently than the average person. I know the problem is that I'm not making any long term changes to my dietary habits, but I find it impossible to undo what I've done for years.

This year has made it 100x worse. I had my first nervous breakdown, been depressed and suicidal, stopped giving a shit about diet and exercise, stopped meditating, now I have nothing to work in synergy with eachother, nothing to compound off each other (e.g. meditation helped significantly with cravings and willpower, healthy eating made me sleep better, sleeping better made me more productive, etc.). I have an emotional attachment to food and I get extreme anxiety when I don't eat until I'm painfully full, and it has to be carbs. Rice in fact. I'm asian and have been eating rice all my life.

I was 71kg at my prime weight after discovering keto, I'm now 84 kg. I feel like an alcoholic who can only live a normal life by cutting alcohol out completely. I can't compromise and do paleo, I CANNOT control how much carbs I eat, I only do well when I cut them out completely.

Problem is I'm just scared of what life will be like if I had to do keto forever. It's been so difficult sticking to it when my family was so against it, I could never join people for meals or buy quick convenient food outside, I had to spend so much time each day thinking of recipes not to get bored of.

All this shit is stupidly affecting me so much I wanna cry. I don't know what to do. I think going keto forever, or at least for a handful of years to come, is my only option. But I'm terrified of how painful it's gonna be, especially now that my mind is half broken and I don't even have the willpower to meditate for 20 minutes. And yes I am trying to look for professional help for my mental health, but it has been extremely difficult due to the pandemic.

Please someone help me"
keto,"Why I did Keto, and why I will do it again even better","I started my Keto Journey at 315lbs.  Male, 6'2"", broad shoulders on a large frame, overweight all my life, struggled mightily with everything I ever tried.  The only thing that ever worked for me was 20 years ago when ephedrine was readily available and in everything.  That stuff worked like a champ for me.  But of course it was all temporary.  

In August of 2019, I started Keto at 315 lbs.  The heaviest I had ever been.  I was miserable and looked like a swollen whale.  I immediately saw the results - I counted calories and did strict Keto.

Then I moved from one state to another, career change, but I maintained the Keto, but not the calorie counting.  I continued to lose, just at a much slower pace.  

Back in July/August, I was down to 267.  I stopped counting calories altogether, but maintained the Keto, but I climbed up to 274.  I stayed there until 3 weeks ago.  Just by eating Keto but not counting calories.  I was strict Keto food only, but realized it was a half measure against the bodyweight by consuming as many calories as I wanted.

Then 3 weeks ago, I broke a bit.  Had some potatoes.  Had some pasta (it was Dreamfield pasta, but still...).  And then Christmas hit.  I survived thanksgiving.  I survived last christmas.  I survived a whole year without eating any sweets.  But this year, I broke.  I broke hard.

Now here's the deal - over the past year and half or so, I've still not had any french fries or chips of any kind.  Those are my weakness.  Sweets never bothered me.  I didn't have to have them.  But this year, oh my goodness.  I broke hard.

And today, I got on the scale, and I was at 284.

315  to  267  to 274  to 284.  I'm bloated.  I've gone up a notch on my belt.  My clothes are tight.  I'm miserable.

I came in and told my wife that i'm miserable and why.  She saw the struggle.  She struggled with me - but she doesn't have a weight problem like me.  She's fit and healthy and active and loves it.  She can eat whatever she wants and it not really affect her overall health because she's always known how to eat things in moderation.  I don't.

She gets it now - after such drastic jump - she gets it.  But this isn't about her, it's about me, and my weaknesses, and my realization that eating a Keto lifestyle works.  

So now, I make my plan moving forward again, this time, counting calories and being strict again.

I need the encouragement. I'm going to do this right this time. Nothing more defeating than being strict for so long, and then seeing the damage done when you give up."
keto,Confused about Net Carbs,"Hello! I was recently diagnosed T2 Diabetic and have since learned keto is one of the best diets to follow.

I went to see a nutritionalist and she told me how to calculate your net carbs: if the fiber is over 5 you subtract half of it from the total carbs. If there are sugar alchohols you can subtract half of that as well. 

So if the item have 10 carbs, 5 fiber, and 2 sugar alchohol it would then end up being 6.5 net carbs.

Everywhere I see for keto says you subtract everything fiber and sugar alchohol, and I can't figure out why. I trust my nutritionalist for obvious reasons, but the fact that companies can sell the product showing lower net carbs confuses me. It makes a huge difference!"
keto,Is keto helpful when it comes Stroke ?,"Hello guys. Hope you're all well ?  I've been a long time lurker here, and been mostly admiring people success with the diet even though I haven't started myself. But today I really need some information and I felt I could get it here. Its just a question I have.

Can keto diet help with recovery from stroke?
Someone very close to me has had stroke for about three years now. Even though they have made some progress, they aren't close to being well yet. They still struggle with speech and shake a little when walking.

So i started thinking of some things that might help speed recovery and keto came to mind.

So....can keto help speed recovery from stroke. Has anyone here had a stroke themselves or had someone close who had it and used keto ? Please share your experience and any tips you may have.

Also,if you have links to any scientific studies that may have been done on the diet and stroke, please share the link .

Thanks in advance for your replies and engagement."

keto,Loose stool when not on keto,"Sorry for the subject matter!

My question is after my last time on keto which was months ago I noticed my poops are rarely ever solid and normal. I pooped normally on keto and my issue now is that being off of keto my poop never returned to normal. I’ve been off keto for about a year now

Anyone else experience this seemingly backwards turn of event? Any info on why and how I can return my digestive system back to normal?"

I want to give keto a go, but my husband and I like to have Saturdays for ourselves, no cooking no cleaning. We usually go out for dinner, but because of lockdown we’ve been ordering in. 

Would it be okay to do keto strictly every day but eat whatever I feel like on Saturday? Or would that completely ruin my work through the week?"
keto,Anyone tried keto for bipolar or depression?,"I struggle with depression and always have. Except for when I was a volunteer for a study involving a keto paleo diet. I commented then that it was the best antidepressant I had ever tried. After the study I stopped the diet but out of frustration with my recent trials of various psych meds, I was considering what I could do for myself instead of waiting to see if the next med will be the one that finally works and keto came to mind. I’m interested to hear others experiences with keto and mental health, including depression and anxiety. I’m bipolar, so even though it’s the depression I’d like to address, I worry about being pushed into a mania. I’ve also heard some say low carbs can cause depression. Please anyone with experience with keto and mental health, good and bad, let me know what your experience was."
keto,keto for a 2-year old toddler,"Hello all! I am on a strict keto diet the last 8 years, (being a type 1 diabetic). My wife also follows a more lazy-keto approach. We have a 2-year old girl, and she kind of naturally eats what we eat. I put a sample of what she eats in a day in [cronometer.com](https://cronometer.com) yesterday, just to check. Calories-wise she was ok (she eats around 1000/day - recommndation from our doctor is around 1000-1400 daily). But her protein was way too much. She gets around 60 grams, whereas she should eat around 15-20 (again, doctor's recommendations). The reason I guess is that it is too difficult for her to eat plain fat, as me and my wife do (olive oil, butter etcr). So she eats foods like eggs, cheese, meat etcr, and these add up her protein intake. So, questions:

1) is there anybody else  doing this with their small kids? Any recommendations?

2) Any ideas for a kid to eat more fat?

3) Any other subreddit / forum you can direct me too, which is dedicated to the subject?

thank you all!!!"

keto,what do you think is the best tasting keto-friendly food source of magnesium?,"so...I think I crave magnesium in a way that closely resembles pica.  Maybe my daily magnesium requirement is higher than average because of celiac, who knows.

I am trying to branch out though and try some new foods.

what do you think is the best tasting keto food source of magnesium?  I am kind of tired of supplementing it even though supplements do help a lot with the cravings.

I imagine a lot of people will respond coffee and dark chocolate... unfortunately I can't have those because of the caffeine, I react to caffeine very badly.  Cashews are not a good option either because I would be way over my carb limit if I ate them in large enough quantities to satisfy the magnesium cravings."
keto,"[Before &amp; After] Interesting journey, not yet over but getting there","I started Keto a few months ago, around October. I weighed about 270. I’ve always been a bit bigger but it started getting out of control with quarantine. I would order a full pepperoni pizza at around noon and eat that in about an hour and wash it down with Pepsi or some other intensely sweet soda. 

If I was really feeling it I would get one with bacon on the crust. It was really out of control. 

I would eat this garbage, be terrified of going to the gym and didn’t really have it in me to start jogging. 

I turned to keto because it was the easiest option. Keto turned into IF and that turned into me doing light exercise two days a week. 

It was a snowball effect. I bought myself a bike and started a daily regiment. It’s become very easy as the weeks went on but it was very very hard for the first few. 

This community has helped me greatly and I’m looking forward to a full transformation next year. Keep at it! 

Currently at 218 - 220 and heading for the GW of 185.

keto,Product labeling and Vitamins,"I am doing really well on Keto, but I've had a few issues with tiredness recently. I'm thinking about taking some supplements as I generally have low levels of D and some B vitamins.

If a vitamin label (and I'm including Omegas) doesn't list carbs, does that mean carb content is negligible or is it just not required for supplements in the US?

I see things like maltodextrin in the ingredients of quite a few of the products.

I'm not talking about chewables, but a one a day or something similiar.  

I know a lot of people are anti-multi, but before the change in ingredients (I'm allergic to berries) I felt amazing when I was on Alive vitamins.

I’ve been keto for 3 months now, and my rash started just after my first 30 days. I feel confident in saying that it is keto related, because after a couple cheat days, it goes away completely, only to come back once I go back into keto. 

I have tried dandelion tea, benydryll black seed oil, and now bile salts. Also a steroid and a couple topical creams. Out of everything, aloe does the most for me. That said, I get maybe an hours relief from itching. 

I’m finding it hard to stay low to no carb with this itch and pain. I also think it’s interesting that the body would have this reaction to what I believe would be a more historically accurate diet. That thought has led me to think maybe i’m dealing with a histamine/hormone imbalance?

When I was younger I gained and lost weight many times doing super restricted calorie diets.

I’ve been considering intermittent fasting, just for overall health, feeling better, but also the potential weightloss as well. There’s a part of me that is worried that this will ultimately slow my metabolism and make me hungrier, gain weight in the long run, like restricted calorie dieting supposedly does. Are there any long-term ketoers that fast and can share your experiences? Or at least help me decide if my current fears are unfounded and stupid?"

I have had a lot of success with Keto for years off and on. With 2020 being so kind to us all, I lost my job, and worked super hard at finally obtaining my dream job, and sticking to keto through it all helped my control the uncontrollable. When life hands you lemons, throw em out, too much sugar. Go eat some bacon!!!"

i also have never been to the gym before and want to start now to develop some muscles. skinny fat is not the move."
keto,Brain clarity after keto? How to keep it?,"One of the benefits that I noticed when on keto is the brain clarity and focus I had. Now that I reached my goal ( yay!!) and transitioning back to steady macros I immediately noticed the brain fogginess. What is this, what is causing this fogginess and how do I get rid of it when not on keto?"
keto,GLUCOSE PROBLEMS DURING KETO,Me and my husband are having problems with our glucose his in 99 and I'm in 95 but we do keto also the doctors told us that we were going to be pre-diabetic. We did some fasting to see if it would help but nothing overall we still the same.
keto,Weight Loss Plateau. Please help.,"I (26, M) weighed 102 Kgs when I started Keto. 10 days later, I am 96 Kgs. Very recently I realised that I have been doing this wrong. I have been consuming around 1000-1200 Kcals per day. I have brought my Maintenance calories so down that I don't feel hungry and I don't lose weight anymore. I exercise/do cardio daily. My weight have been fluctuating from 96-97 Kgs for four days now. 

Should I wait to see progress or change anything in my diet?"
keto,[Before v. After] Some motivation during a slight weight stall for cheery holiday spirit!,"I used to think I don’t pack much weight or fat in my face. 

I am happy to have been proven wrong, oh so very wrong. 

10 months back my life was undergoing many changes: I had quit my job, I started seeing someone new, I was also getting over a lot of self hate. 

I am thoroughly enjoying this transformation journey. 

Yes, I’m facing a short weight stall but I’m trying to remain positive throughout it. 

I also had some delicious brewed beer after a VERY long time, yesterday. Back to proper food and beverages now!

Thank you for helping me feel [cute even in a sweater](https://imgur.com/a/CyfDcNB). A sweater that did not fit me before and a sweater that’s lovely to wear now. 

Oh the strands of my struggle, they weave together,
They make me who I am today, battling against the rough weather.

keto,Is ketose a survival mode of the body?,"I often hear people say that ketose is a survival mode of the body. Is there any scientific proof backing this claim? It sounds rather negative and unnatural to me. 

I believe going in and out of ketose is more natural than a carb based diet. I don't know if this is correct but I assume that our hunter and gatherer ancestors fasted regularly and had often low carb diets out of necessity. Our body is made to go into ketose. And our ancestors were a lot longer on the planet than us modern humans. 

Also, I believe that our high carb diets are just a consequence of the industrial revolution (easy and cheap to produce). Our use of carbs isn't natural then, it's just convenience."
keto,Cheat Day?,Does anyone else allow themselves a cheat day on keto/carnivore? My overall health has improved dramatically in the last 9 months of being on this diet but I can't fathom restricting myself 100% of the time. I allow myself one day a week to eat what I want then return to keto/carnivore the following day.  I'll usually order Chinese food or pizza and make a nice dessert.  Other times I'll just snack on different foods throughout the day.
keto,Am I still in ketosis?,"For my Christmas OMAD I had 25g of net carbs. 

I’m a 5’10, 200lb 20 year old male"
keto,First 3 weeks experience,"I started keto on a whim. I've been eyeing a diet change but was having a hard time deciding on something as I am thoroughly tired of counting calories and I hate doing anything in the kitchen. I am addicted to carbs, do not eat enough protein, and have a problem with ""moderate"" portions. It's hard to eat until you're full if what you're eating is simple carbs and sugar. I don't eat 1 cookie, I eat all the cookies. I don't eat a piece of pizza, I eat 85% of a pizza. I will overeat any simple carb: rice, pasta, tortillas --compulsively.

Keto hasn't really been an option in my head because I believe in the power of veggies. The roadblock is that I am too lazy to prep them. I don't like cutting them, I don't like washing them, I don't like seasoning them or baking or boiling or even eating them raw. I have other shit I have to force myself to do daily, prepping food is unfortunately very low on my list and rarely makes the cut. 

One day I just decided to try keto for the hell of it.  Plopping meat into a crockpot or frying bacon and eggs, or bacon and frozen broccoli florets is something I can do. ... And I've been doing it, consistently for 3 weeks now with very little effort and very little difficulty. THIS IS A MILESTONE. I couldn't tell you the last time I managed my diet for a full 3 weeks, or even 3 days.

I still watch my calories but I am not ""failing"" if I go over because I am still in keto. I weigh most of my food on a food scale before I cook it.

I still drink coffee, but with heavy cream and fake sugar. I'm able to make some tasty low-effort food like quesadillas with cauliflower and egg substitutions for bread. I don't actually like meat that much it turns out, but that's ok. I eat it anyway.

Inflammation is way down in my body. Mobility is like 50% better. I have not gotten the keto flu, but I haven't been tracking electrolytes either. I've had very few cravings, and they were satisfied with my fake quesadilla. I have been THIRSTY and I had to pee a lot at first, which is normal. My um.. other bathroom time has normalized and has been a surprisingly easy process since I started. 

I haven't been losing quickly, but shockingly that doesn't bother me because I don't feel deprived when I eat this way. I even have a hard time eating 1200 calories some days. Honestly though I have gone over my calories pretty much every day except this week and I am down 8 lbs. I know that's a lot for some people but I tend to lose more when I start a diet. I'm trying to do it different this time because it doesn't matter if it comes off quickly if it is not sustainable and you gain it all back right when you stop.

I know this info is kind of redundant for many people but I wanted to share in case someone new is curious about how their body might handle it. My body loves it. I know that isn't the case for everyone and I know this may change, but so far so good.


I want to keep this up for 4 to 6 months. Maybe longer. I have about 60-70 lbs more to lose. I don't know if I want to start adding complex carbs in when I have reached a weight I am happy with or if I will decide to add them in earlier.  I'm content to find out.

I do know one thing though: simple carbs are gonna have to go to hell. They have no place in my life unless I want to gain a bunch of weight."
keto,Keto Meal Bars?,"Are there any actually keto meal replacement bars that aren't terrible? I'm headed out for a 3-week backpacking trip, and would like to take some meal bars for quick snacks/meals. Most of the bars adverstised as ""keto"" that I've seen have more carbs than fat.

keto,"Haven't relapsed since Keto, Thank you so much","  

This is my first post on this subreddit and is pretty much an appreciation post. I’ve always been dieting since high school. I’ve jumped from one unhealthy diet to disorder eating to a full-blown eating disorder. It has been a thing I’ve constantly had to battle with. My love for food and the amount I wish to consume doesn’t exactly sit right with my body. Plus, the fact I love to bake and have a sugar addiction wasn’t exactly helping my case. Then I tend to be a size that I do not appreciate which leads to more insecurity and depression. Anyways this quarantine while doing HIIT exercises at home and eating once a day to lose weight, I decided to try the keto diet. I am not sure what my starting weight was because I threw away my weight scale when I decided to lose weight again so my brain can notice the physical differences and not the scale numbers. But I’ve gotten back to a ‘normal’ BMI (I repurchased the scale back because I was confident I won't obsess about it too much or it won't trigger a depressive episode). 

So thank you, Keto. Since I started this diet in July I have not relapsed once. I suffer from bulimia. Even though I restricted daily and maybe ate once a day with other diets, I always relapsed from time to time. But I have not relapsed at all (I do IF and pretty much eat twice a day). I haven’t felt the need to.  Even on occasions where I may have binged quite a bit, it has not destroyed me mentally to result to the need to allow a relapse. So thank you for saving my throat.

Thank you, Keto, for making me think with a healthy mindset. While starting this diet, I’ve become more alert about making sure I have the required vitamin per day. I’ve learnt a lot about electrolyte things I never paid attention to. I have learnt how to utilise other vegetables (I never knew I’d like mushrooms and Brussel sprout and arugula the way I do now).

Thank you Keto for making me feel full without feeling guilty. If I wasn’t still hungry or starved, I felt I was doing something wrong. As I’ve tried to change the way I think, having this diet has aided restructuring how I think about food. Being full is not a bad thing. It's nice to not be constantly hungry and to enjoy my food without guilt.

Thank you r/keto and r/ketorecipes . Your posts have made it easy to transition into this diet. Educating me on the different kind of sugar alcohols, some which may not be the best alternative. Reading your post and learning from your struggles which are similar to mine has made me more knowledgeable about what I need to do to succeed with this food style.

Thank you and Merry Christmas. 

**Quick question**: I have a bunch of sweeteners for coffee because I usually like to make my own lattes at home (Matcha latte sweetened with a peppermint sweetener is my holiday obsession right now). Is it okay to take sweeteners every day? I usually only take two tablespoons per day or when I do make my lattes."
keto,Consuming Vegetables?!,"Hi guys so Im little confused on how many carbs I can eat from vegetables to not get kicked out of ketosis or does eating vegetables not kick you out at all for eating alot of them?

If i eat more than 20g of carbs in day that comes from vegetables will this kick me out or like If i had a small amount of carb intake from other foods that are keto friendly but ate alot of vegetables that added more carbs that exceeded my daily carb intake is this bad?

Im sure this is an obvious answer but i just would like to get some opinions on this."

keto,NSV: I did not exceed my carbs for christmas dinner!!,"I just wanted to share that my planning for christmas eve dinner at my mom's house paid off.

keto,What could be the causes of diarrhea on Keto?,"I never had issue with diarrhea being on keto, the only time this happened was when I accidentally eat too much carbs. 

This time however I eat too much yesterday, but it was mostly chicken and salad, except I eat a cup of nuts (Almonds, peanuts, cashew) and drank wine for the first time in over a year. I don't think a cup of nuts is that much high in carbs though."
keto,The last 4 months of keto have changed my life,"
The past 4 months (we’ll post keto flu) have been phenomenal.  As a person who has spent years eating my feelings and trying every diet under the sun, I’ve come through a year of counselling to deal with my family issues and started keto. 
I’ve spent the past 4 months with no food cravings, no over eating,no fighting hunger, no eating when my emotions flare, and I don’t spend every minute watching the clock for my next meal like I used to. It’s magic, ok so I know it’s science but it feels like magic.  

My hba1c is down a couple points which is moving in the right direction and I’m down 18lbs. 

Today (Christmas)  is the first day I’ve eaten the wrong things. My stomach feels uncomfortably full and I’m craving something, but who knows what.

I can only put that down to the pull of Christmas or the fear of missing out.  All I’m missing out on now is the sated feeling I usually have after a normal keto meal and the feeling of being  comfortable in my body which an overfill stomach definitely doesn’t give. 

A shitty way to be  reminded on why I started this lifestyle though awesome to realise how far I’ve come when I used to have this feeling all the time. Blech!

Happy Holidays keto peeps.  Thanks for all the great advice on this community you’re amazing and keto is literally a lifesaver if my blood tests and scales continue to trend downward.   Stay safe out there."
keto,Does waterfasting 24h before eating keto get me in ketosis faster,"Been wondering cause I see it as some sort of ""cleanse"" to fast for 24 hours before eating keto cause my body needs it or something but is this even real, does it even help or should i just eat keto asap and that will get me faster in it"
keto,Not sure how to do keto while visiting family!,"Hi there! So i’m honestly feeling really crappy and super insecure having gained so much weight through 2020. Worked my ass off all 2019 just to gain it all back this crappy year. Super upset with myself, kinda feel like I just let myself go. I’m ready and eager to be back on keto but i’m running into a problem. 

Anyways, I don’t wanna wait till January 1st to begin keto again. I REALLY want to start now, and be back in the groove by the new year. My problem is, I’m traveling down to visit my boyfriends family for about a week (26th til new years) and the thought of spending a week there and eating a bunch of crap feels like torture. I’m bloated just thinking about it. His parents are Mexican and cook amazing meals for us every day when we visit and it’s the sweetest thing, and I have NO idea what i’m supposed to do or how to be on keto while visiting them. We will be fully staying with them so it’s not like I will be able to prepare and eat my own meals during the trip. I cant help but feel like it’ll be disrespectful and also confusing to them if I decline their offerings of food while we’re down there. 

I really don’t want to just shrug it off because it’s “just another week” as i’m super tired of feeling so crappy and down and I truly miss being committed to keto. I’m considering maybe doing an adaptation of keto+IF possibly? Maybe wait until dinner to eat (as that’s the meal they/we traditionally all share together)and try my hardest to limit my carb intake for that meal? Stick to meats, avoid tortillas, bread, sweets etc.  

Just super stressed and looking for some tips or input! Really don’t want to be rude by not eating their food but I also really want to do this for myself! Help!"

keto,does anyone else just use the diet to correct a few kilograms away at a time,"i have a normal diet (doesn’t incorporate pretty much any sweets cause i’m not much of a sweet tooth, occasional beers, normal cooked food and wine most of the time, bimonthly takeout) and usually in about half a year I get one stressful period when I snack more often than usual. some weeks pass and I noticed I gained a few kilograms, so I course correct them off by going on strict below 20g carbs keto for 2 weeks. I noticed that I tend to do this cycle rather consistently these days every half a year or so and I’m wondering if anyone else uses keto simply as a correction tool rather than buying wholly into the lifestyle for long periods of time for large weight loss (or just as a lifestyle choice) as most folks tend to do on this sub?"

keto,Dear Tall Male Keto'ers: 1200 calories is not 'low for an adult',"Hi. I am a 38-yo 5'4"" 140lbs  woman with at least 30% body fat (verging on normal weight obesity, or more colloquially, ""skinny fat"") , and I'm interested in shedding some of that extra fat. According to the sidebar calculator, someone with my stats eating at a 20% caloric deficit should be eating 1170 calories per day. No problem! I'm a little over 2 weeks into keto and I consider myself pretty adapted, and sometimes I have trouble breaking 1000 calories in a day, though I usually try to. 

However, in thread after thread I see people responding to women with similar stats as mine (or even shorter and with less body fat) telling them that 1200 calories is 'low for an adult', or even offering them their TDEE and telling them to start there, instead of telling them the calories they should be eating at a deficit if they want to lose weight. 

I consider myself to be average height (in fact, 5'4' is exactly average for women) , and I especially consider myself an adult. My caloric needs just are what they are. I just don't need as many calories as a 30-yo 6' man who weighs 250lbs. 

According to the keto calculator on the sidebar, a 30-yo 6' 250 lbs male with 22% body fat eating at a 15% deficit should be eating 2007 calories per day, and this of course increases as height / weight goes up. So yeah I know 1200 \*seems\* low when you're eating &gt; 2000 calories a day, but it's just not. Not for people with stats similar to mine. 

So please refrain from telling people like me that our caloric needs are 'low for an adult'. You wouldn't tell Mr. 6' 250lb to eat at TDEE if they're trying to lose weight, nor should you tell people like me the same. 

Thanks!"
keto,My Keto Experience-Sugar is Poison,"# I have been on a keto diet for a little over 2 months.  

*I am 52, my health was declining and I had to make a decision, either suffer the consequences which would have ended up a heart attack or figure out how to get in better health before it was to late.*

The first 30 years of my life I could eat whatever I wanted and it did not affect my weight at all.   I ate tons of food and at least half of that had sugar in it, I was addicted to sugar early on in my childhood. From about 4 years old to ten I was allergic to milk so ice cream and most chocolate was out of the question.

It was really hard to watch my brother, friends and adults eat ice-cream and chocolate when I could not have any.  I would not touch it as had extreme reactions that were very painful. I remember once eating a small cake at school that had whey in it, the teacher told me it would be ok, whey was not the same as milk.  I never believed what a teacher told me about food ever again.

    Late that night I woke up in extreme pain, my lips were on fire!  The reaction had caused them to swell up about 8 times the normal size and they busted open in more places than I could count.  I couldn't go back to sleep  and missed school for the next week while they were healing back up. The doctor confirmed it was my allergic reaction to milk.

I outgrew the allergy at about 10, I made a commitment I was going to make up for all the lost time eating ice cream and chocolate. I wasted no time doing so and any time either was in the house I would eat as much as possible. I had to have the biggest bowl of ice cream,  I had to have twice as much chocolate candy as anyone else. 

 I would guilt my parents and grandparents into giving me what I wanted using my previous allergy as why should have more because I got cheated the past few years. It worked well for about 2 years, after that I would sneak what I wanted when no one was looking.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In my thirties it had gotten so bad I was drinking a twelve pack of soda most days,. my favorite was Coke. I drank so much I had horrible acid reflux and it burnt out my  lower esophageal sphincter. So I switched from Coke to Dr Pepper and continued on my  sugar crusade. 

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up many nights choking because the soda and stomach acid had come up in my throat  and went down my wind pipe. This was some very scary experiences, many times thinking I was going to choke to death.  I did not put 2 and 2 together so I continued with sugar and soda. **How I did not die during that time is beyond me.**

In my forties I slowed down on soda as I had finally started gaining weight, but I did not change my sugar intake.

&amp;#x200B;

*  My weight continued to rise. In my late 40's my health really started deteriorating. 
* I would easily lose my breath. 
* The weight of the fat on my intestines caused an inguinal hernia. 
* My blood pressure untreated was 240 over 120. 
* I started getting chest pains 
* My energy level was just above non existent. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I entered my fifties my weight began to rise uncontrollably. I could not seem to stop it no matter what I did I could clearly see I was headed for a catastrophe very soon. I had been following a keto coach on FB for a while had seen her transformation. I felt like that was probably my last hope.

I did a little research and found a food guide and a keto friendly shake that was suppose to help with breaking the sugar addiction, help me sleep better and give me more energy.

**It has been amazing to this point, When I started I weighed 240lbs I want to get down to 190lbs.  I am currently at 230lbs I have lost 4 waist sizes my belly no longer drapes over the top of my pants, my blood pressure is on the decline, my chest pains have stopped, my energy level has sky rocketed.**

&amp;#x200B;

I can't run a marathon yet,  but I don't easily run out of breath and I can run a block with out having to worry about falling down or having a heart attack.   So I am doing tons better, I still have a long way to go but I am doing great and am very happy with my progress so far.

&amp;#x200B;

*When it comes to the bathroom scales here is what I have found out.*

**Measuring your weight  is the worst way to track your progress, you definitely want to monitor it but alone does not tell how well you are doing.**

For me the best time to weigh myself is early in the morning after I have peed and pooped but before I have had anything to drink or eat, with minimal clothes on. Here is why.

&amp;#x200B;

*  Water weighs 7.33 pounds per gallon so every 8 ounce glass of water you drink is almost half a pound. When you add things to water it increases the weight. so coffee and tea are a little heavier than that.
* Food of any type has has weight so any meal you eat increases your weight.
* When you go to the bathroom you loose weight when you pee and poop.
* these two factors are one of the biggest reasons your weight is constantly changing and makes it really hard to get an accurate measurement.

&amp;#x200B;

 As crazy as this sounds it is absolutely true.  When my scales are facing east I weigh less than any other direction, if they are facing north i weigh more than any other direction usually 3 to 5 pounds more than east. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**I would love to hear your experiences with this. Does the direction you and the scales are facing have an effect on the weight the scales show?**

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the [food guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xpVyAsvLqsxz_MWREBcKPt6SdGg0W8WU/view?usp=sharing) I have been using, maybe it will help others as much as it has helped me.  If you would like more information on the shake you can find it [here](https://richardcaldwell.myctfo.com/product_details.html?productcode=extremevan2pk).

&amp;#x200B;

I have recently done a lot of research on sugar, the things I have found are mind blowing and disgusting.  I will make another post concerning sugar soon but here is the short version

&amp;#x200B;

1. Heart disease in the number on cause of death in the U.S. Sugar is the main cause of heart disease.
2. The main cause of diabetes is sugar.
3. Sugar is the root cause of thousands of physical and mental diseases.
4. Sugar causes inflammation which is the main cause of pain in the body.
5. Sugar has been linked to  Alzheimer's    

   

It is my suggestion to get as far away from sugar as possible. 

It does taste great and is awesome to have around holidays but for the rest of the year staying away from it is a good idea.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to here your thoughts.

# Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!"
keto,43lbs gone!!,Started keto and calorie counting the day after Thanksgiving. Starting weight was 310 current weight of 267. The success posts and informative comments have been huge in me starting this and doing it correctly.  Thank you everybody.
keto,Does skin get more sensitive first couple months of keto?,"35F, PCOS diagnosed a month and a half ago, recent hair loss this year and likely sebderm issues. Every couple weeks I get what seems to be a flare-up with red, irritated, burning scalp, some flakes. I started keto/low carb about 2 months ago and I feel like these flare ups are more frequent now. They are driving me CRAZY, and it's a constant reminder of my hair loss. I also feel like my skin everywhere is much more sensitive, esp on my scalp.

Anyone else experience this on keto/low carb? Did it get worse before it got better for those of you that keto/low carb worked?"
keto,Need some advice...,"Hi all! I have relied on you all so much over the last year. I am down 80 lbs now because of it! I have 2 things crossing my mind: I need to tone up my mid section for sure. Already do planks, sit-ups, and Russian twists. Looking for standing exercises I can do. 
Secondly, I still have 40 more to go but was wondering what then??? I love keto but would like to put a few more carbs in but every time I do, I gain 7 lbs instantly. Any suggestions? Carb cycling maybe? Thanks again for all your help!"
keto,Traditions involving food,"Does anyone else have food traditions that are bad for you but you only have them the one time a year? Do you still allow that on keto? We have a NYE tradition with a not good for you food ""buffet"" (aka all the food out on my kitchen table). Things like pizza rolls and White Castles, peach Bellinis, etc. I only eat these things at NYE (ignoring the immensely stressful quarantine summer with the kids).

I'm still planning to do this but without the ""eat all the things"" mentality.  What are some tips for not going completely off the rails? I added some keto friend veggie dip and an aging a lot of veggies to the table, but I'm thinking maybe I should also lay off the keto fat content... Avoid carbs and sugar that aren't part of the most ""important"" of the traditional food (not getting Doritos and chips and salsa for example)."
keto,IQ Bars thoughts?,I picked up an IQ at CVS and it says 4 net carbs per bar and the ingredients look pretty good but there’s one thing that popped out at me which was rice flour? Is rice flour a fiber or something or just a plain carb? So I guess what I’m asking is if rice flour is a fiber is it a fiber I can’t subtract like IMO?
keto,Working out and keto,"Hi everyone! I'm new to this subreddit and I've been on keto for a month this Saturday. Its been going good but I'm struggling with working out. Before keto I'd do heavy hiit workouts 6x a week and can survive them. Now, 5 min in and it feels like I havnt worked out in years. I have no energy to even continue but I still push with having to stop alot. I've stopped doing hiit for now and incorporated lower impact like martial arts, power walking, more target specific areas. I really love hiit so is the keto lifestyle and hiit possible? Or should I get used to only doing lower impact maybe incorporate lifting?"
keto,Is too much water on keto bad?,"I’m starting keto on the 1st. I’ve been doing hours and hours of research and blog reading before I begin my journey and I’ve been quietly creepin on this sub Reddit, reading stories and recipes ect. But I’ve yet to see anyone mention they realized they drink too MUCH water - I’ve been drinking a gallon of water at least for the last two years, and you lose weight initially that is water weight, so does that mean if I continuously drink this much water, I won’t lose weight..? Thanks for any advice in advance."
keto,Amazing results after just 8 weeks!,"I am so happy to let y'all know that I am officially down exactly 50lbs since October 27th! I am a 26 year old Male, 6'0"" SW: 322.8lbs CW: 272.8lbs. I am overjoyed this holiday season with my new lifestyle :) 

For anyone who is having a hard time, just know that I am no one special and this is my second time going on keto. Never give up on yourself and don't get discouraged by anything that may come to you during this difficult journey. You got this!!! KCKO!"
keto,"Massive HR spike, pretty sure it's electrolytes, how the heck are you guys supplementing enough?","Hi all, I'm about 2 weeks into keto / OMAD and feeling generally fine...except for a massive concern over my heart. As background, I do have a heart condition (mitral valve prolapse) and take beta-blockers to keep my HR and BP low, so I'm immensely worried.

Normally my resting heart rate is at 50. On keto, I'm finding it from 85 - 100. Having researched a bit to know that my kidneys are flushing sodium, I've started taking around 1 teaspoon of salt per day in my morning water. I also bought some electrolyte pills. The pills have 50 mg Mag, 202 mg sodium, 99 mg potassium. And my heart rate is still sky high. I went to the supermarket yesterday and bought magnesium (250 mg) and potassium gluconate (90mg) supplements. Took them yesterday, took them today, RHP still massive.

I came to these boards and read more and saw posters advising to take 5000mg sodium, 1000-3500mg potassium, and 500mg bioavailable magnesium. My question is...how the hell are you guys hitting these massive numbers? As someone that's going OMAD and essentially half-fasting, I definitely do not eat enough food to salt the hell out of everything. Do you guys have any suggestions on how to hit those numbers? Are there special powders? Because all the powders and pills I'm seeing would require like 10 doses to hit the values I'm seeing suggested."
keto,Is there any major organ damage when you slip in and out of ketosis regulary?,"Is there any major organ damage when you slip in and out of ketosis regulary?  


Like staying in ketosis for 6 days a week and then having a full blown cheatday with sugar, popcorn, oreos, ... on the 7. day. And that every week."
keto,I lost 13 lbs in 6 days.,"I (SW: 262, CW: 249) lost 13 lbs in 6 days. For reference i just started keto 6 days ago. Should I be concerned? It seems unhealthy to lose that much weight in such a short amount of time. Any words of assurance would be greatly appreciated :)"
keto,Best lettuce to use for unwhiches/lettuce wraps? How do I make them not fall apart?,"I'm trying to make a solid unwhich at home. Tired of paying 10 bucks at Jimmy John's for 3 pieces of lettuce and 5 slices of deli meat ;-;

But whenever I try to make them at home, they unfurrel as soon I take away the parchment paper. Also, what lettuce do I use? Romaine doesn't work, it's too small. Do I use butter lettuce? Collards? Iceberg?"
keto,Backfire?,"Dear keto fellows, 
I hope you are staying away from carbs!

I pursued Keto for six months; the results were astonishing. I lost 36 Kg! I’m 5 kg away from my perfect weight. 

BUT today I ate all kinds of Carbs: chips, bread, chocolate, fruits. I officially broke the diet. My question is, do you think this thing would backfire? Can I just return to my life?  Is it ok to stop the keto like this?

Thank you!"
keto,Allulose VS Monkfruit,"Hello! I have a quick question that I really hope someone can help me with...I was trying to reorganize my pantry, and putting things in jars rather than the bags/containers they came in. Before I had a chance to label them, I picked up my jar of Allulose and my jar of Monkfruit-Erythritol blend and im worried I may have mixed the two up.

One of the sweeteners has much larger (almost sparkly) grains, whereas the other is finer and almost powdery. Im just wondering if anyone in this sub might be able to help me figure out which is which?"
keto,Merry Christmas to me!!!,"As of this morning, I’ve lost 20 lbs!!! I’m making keto Christmas dinner, dessert, and pancakes in the morning. My back inflammation has decreased (disc degeneration) and I think my depression is a little improved as well. Hooray!"
keto,I need a recommendation for the great Books for KETO Daily meal plans for Bodybuilding.,"Hello,

 I am a male 170 cm tall, I am currently following a 60%, 35%, 5% keto diet. I am having hard time finding recopies to meet my nutrition demands. I am trying to find a book that is helpful with regards to detials daily meal plans. For example, tells you what to eat per day, gives you meal samples, etc.

Can you please make a recommendation for book that goes through a daily meal plan Keto of course for bodybuilders or weight lifters. thank you"
keto,how many calories should i be ingesting a day for the keto diet,"i started the diet about 2 and a half weeks ago and im seeing some good progress, but im worried that i might be doing something wrong. im not sure how  many calories i should be eating a day, on a bad say ill eat maybe 1000-1100 calories, is this more then i should be eating? im not sure exactly what my weight is since my measurer broke but i think i started out at around 102 kg M."
keto,My HWC addiction. How do I substitute?,"My carb tracker was telling me HWC (Darigold 40%) had 0 carbs. So naturally, I am no stranger to having a whole cup. I just learned better.

Question: How can I use less HWC, but get a similar thickness and creamyness?

How can I get a low-carb pudding like consistency in my occasional hot chocolate pudding?"
keto,First Christmas on Keto,"I re-started Keto 3 weeks ago knowing fine well Christmas was approaching. I regard myself as a carb addict (Dr Rob Cywes helped me realise), so I knew this time of year would be a challenge. 
Even as resently as yesterday I was tempted to just fall off the wagon and buy the food I would normally eat around Christmas.... but I didn't. This is a huge step for me as I would normally just give in.
Anyone else experiencing their first keto Christmas? How are you feeling?"
keto,Epilepsy medicine and keto,"Hi everyone! 
 
For ages now I (27f) have wanted to try a month of keto with my bf (29m) but he is put off because of his medicine, and believes it will prevent him going into ketosis or getting anything out of it.

I have PCOS and he has epilepsy, which is why I’m so keen for us to do it, but he is on Keppra oral solution and lamictal dissolvable tablets twice a day, which he says have a carb content of 12280mg (of basically pure sugar) per day. 

Would this prevent him seeing benefits? Does anyone have experience of the interaction of medications this way?

Any advice much appreciated"
keto,Merry Xmas!,"Hello. 

I've ketoed over a month now and I think I'm fat adapted already.

Over 1k deficit everyday. 

How bad is it if I eat 2 days whatever xmas food I want? 

Could it even help with fat loss? 

Or destroy the fat adaption.. 

Stay safe♥️"
keto,Please Review my Macros and Timeline,"

Hi, I fell into depression this year and one of the main reasons has been weight. I went from mostly lean ~15% (navy bf calculator and comparing reference pictures) to borderline overweight. I recently got a DEXA scan and it came back as 23.2% fat. This was surprising to me because the keto calculator projected body fat % was really accurate at 23%. I was wondering if a 20% deficit would help me get to my goal of 10% in a year? How accurate is the timeline because it projects me to be at 10% body fat at around mid-September of 2021. Thanks

keto,"Stuck at 82 kg ( 180 lbs), Need your help to continue losing fat!","Hello,

I started the keto diet about 6 months ago. I lost 20 kgs. (102 kg to 82 kg) I have been stuck at 82 kg. I need your help. During my weight loss, my diet consisted mostly of meat such as burgers, beef which are high in animal fat. right now I am tight on finances and need an alternate source for fat (non diary)  to help me continue losing fat.

&amp;#x200B;

Please if anyone has gone through my same phase. share your experience and how you were able to continue losing weight."
keto,Lost 2.2kg in 4 days on the 19th week,"Hello fellow ketoers!

I started the Keto lifestyle on the 17th of August this year with the main intention of losing weight. At the start, I weighed 130.3kg and as of today I weight 103.1kg. I am 168 cm tall and 28 years old and female. I consume about 1200-1300 kcal daily and mostly staying well under the Carb limit of 20g.

I usually weigh myself on Monday but if I’m extremely tempted, I weigh myself once again midweek and I happened to do that today. This past Monday I was 105.3kg and today I’m 103.1kg. That’s a lot of weight for just 4 days, considering that it’s not the initial water weight to whoosh just like that. I haven’t really worked out and I have not been consuming enough protein this past week because of some personal reasons(stress etc.). I do intend to eat upto my protein limit again but now I’m worried that the 2.2kg that I lost in 4 days, is my muscle weight. 

Can someone here make sense out of this and give me some reasoning as to what might have happened?

Thank you in advance!"
keto,List of Foods,"Hey! So my husband and I are new to the Keto lifestyle. He is 43 and I am soon-to-be 32. We have found some staples for our pantry that are ""Keto necessities"" if you will. We currently live in Wyoming. If you haven't been to Wyoming before, then it may be hard to picture. The closest Walmart to our house is a 1-hour drive to get there depending on traffic [40.3 miles]. We don't get to town very often, and when we do we always forget something. Sometimes it can be hard to stay Keto when you forget a staple during your town trip. You know how it goes!

We both work at our local grocery store, my husband as the supervisor and me as a cashier/carry-out/stocker. We currently do not have very many Keto-friendly products available [we do, however, carry ZERO CARB/ZERO SUGAR heavy whipping cream (not &lt;1....totally 0)] as well as a coconut almond milk that is also zero carb/zero sugar. I was pretty excited about those as carbs in desserts can add up and by cutting it out of the heavy whipping cream and coconut milk it leaves room for other goodies. 

The store we work at was recently sold to new owners. With any transition of ownership, it has been stressful. The good part of this is that the new owner is totally for us taking control of the store, what we sell and don't sell, and arranging it as we see best. With this information, we can look to see if our distributor carries Keto friendly products that we can put on the shelves. Staples to a Keto-friendly pantry if you will. 

So, as other Keto households, what are staples you look for at grocery stores and what do you wish grocery stores carried? I would love to get a list together not only for things we can look at ordering but as a place for beginning-Keto followers can refer to for ""staples"". 

As a side note, we do use Swerve and have already added it to our shelves :) 

Aaaaand go....."
keto,Egg replacement,"Hello, I'm new to the keto diet and have have been trying to find an egg replacement for some cheese sticks that I am wanting to cook.

keto,Mike Israetel from Renaissance Periodization says carbs help slow down muscle breakdown rate,"Yes I do understand that eating adequate protein minimizes muscle loss. But he says higher carbs also help muscle and protein loss. Are we losing anything with low carbs?

keto,How to deal with the loss of fave foods? I have wild fantasies about fresh mangoes lately,"Beginner here.

It’s not that I’m hungry. I can be fully sated from two scrambled eggs fried in butter, no problem, but I still find my mind wandering to thoughts of mangos, baked beans, apples, carrots dipped in hummus, breaded schnitzel and all kinds of other foods that have some carbs. 

I’m not even thinking about the hyper sugary foods such as donuts or pasta, but even the loss of fruit is tricky to deal with right now.

Just wondering if you just blacklist them altogether, or manage to squeeze them into your 20 gram daily allowance somehow."
keto,Staying keto on a post-surgery liquid diet,"Hello all,

I am having major orthagnathic (jaw) surgery in June and will be on a strict liquid diet, followed by a period of ‘soft foods’ that don’t require any chewing. I will be unable to make any chewing movements for *at least* 6 weeks.

I first started keto about 2.5 years ago with insane success and have really fallen off in the last couple months. I just had an appointment with my surgeon and am hugely motivated to get into the best shape possible so I recover well, as this is going to be an intense procedure. 

Since I have 6 months to prepare for this surgery, I am planning a 5 day fast to get myself into ketosis again  and maintain a strict (&lt;20carbs) diet after that leading up to my surgery.

I find keto to be easiest to follow when I have simple meals.. but that means I end up eating a lot of eggs, meat and cheese, some vegetables and added fat sources as well obviously... but I really haven’t had much success with keto ‘products’ or supplements... and I refuse to try putting meat in a blender (yes, people have suggested that to me haha).

I am in a panic as to how to stay in keto while only being allowed liquids. I know I can make a shake with protein powder/ MCT oil / heavy cream.. that kind of thing, but I think that’s going to get intensely boring when I can’t even add in some fruit or something to mix it up flavour wise. I know avocado &amp; cocoa go well together but again, can’t be having that 3 times a day. 

Does anybody have any ideas? I’ve heard of keto chow but I tend to have a really bad time with sucralose, I hear they have one flavour made with monk fruit but the reviews were really not great. 

Any ideas you kind folk have for me would greatly appreciated! Happy holidays everyone!"
keto,How much damage if i eat every thing this holiday?,"Typing this from phone, sorry for typos.  So im planning to eat everything thats presented to me this holiday lol.  Lots of pasta, deserts, and alcohol.  Im just wondering how much damage will i do? Will i gain easy 10 lbs over night? Thanks!"
keto,Have you guys cut out diet soda?,"I'll start by saying: there's nothing wrong with diet sodas, they don't kick you out of ketosis (as far as I can tell).

But I've just decided, for myself, that I don't want to be drinking a liter of some chemical cocktail every day. I'd rather just drink water, or maybe some sparkling water. 

What are you guy's opinion on this? Do you guys think that it's good to drink it daily, or that it's just a crutch for getting off sugar?"
keto,Unpopular opinion: sweetness is a drug,"Why cant people just enjoy the food without the sweet taste. I can understand if you just switched from eating crap that you may want to sweeten your food (like any drug, change may need to happen slowly), but a lot of Keto/Paleo bloggers just can't cook without them. Surely one big part of the Keto diet is to eat wholefoods no additives."
keto,Is anyone concerned about the Vegan/ anti-meat lobby?,"Is there any reason to worry about the anti-meat sentiment. Like, could you see them getting their way on legislation and policies? I don’t really don’t want a future without meat being widely available and affordable. 

I feel kinda stupid for asking, but I worry about stupid things all the time. Lol"
keto,Holiday Carb Bloat? Yes its real,"I thought I'd share this experience for anyone thinking about what happens when you blow up your keto routine over the holidays.

Last weekend our properly quarantined daughter and son in law came to visit which of course turned into a party.🍾🍺

Beer, bourbon, chips, snacks, which was fun but of course made me feel like crap the next morning.🤢

Feeling crappy naturally required some very un-keto bagels and pancakes to remedy 🤨

Before this for months my weight was a nice consistent 170-171😇

After the kids left 176 😢

So instead of giving up, I went back on full keto which is 50g carbs for me

2 days later I'm back down  to 171 !!!

So there is hope and a plan that works when you stray from keto

Don't give up!

keto,Keto made me depressed and lacking in energy! Could this be due to hypothyroidism and tpo antibodies? Maybe it's not the diet for me,"So I have been doing 2 months of keto and I never experienced any mental clarity or energy, no motivation or drive to do anything, I felt depressed and I could barely get out of bed in the morning. Not to mention how constipated I was( sorry, tmi). I have read about it not being the best for those that have thyroid antibodies as carbs shouldnt be kept that low. Can someone please explain?"
keto,Best tracking app for Keto?,"Trying to decide between Cronometer or MyFitnessPal- to track food for my Keto diet.

Any thoughts on which is better for someone following Keto?

I’m in the UK, if this makes any difference with regaards their food databases.

Many thanks."
keto,This is dumb and embarrassing but I’m kinda scared to go the bathroom now WARNING bathroom talk inside.,"I was an idiot a few months ago and let my fiber intake slip to 0 for a few days which resulted in a really scary experience. I was woken up in the middle of the night by intense stomach pain and ran to the bathroom to take a number 2 but nothing would come and my stomach felt so bad. I ended up passing out and falling off the toilet and bashing my head on the wall and cut my lip. I woke up on the floor dazed and I didn’t know where I was for a moment. I’ve tried to be better about supplementing my diet with fiber since then and have been well and that kind of pain hasn’t happened since. However I just drank some fiber right now and I think it was a mistake. I had an all protein dinner and I realized I needed fiber so I just drank some and now my stomach is making all these sounds and I feel slight pressure and I’m kinda scared. I know this is dumb, I had fiber earlier as well so I should be good. I don’t want to panic."
keto,Veteran advice please?,"F/39/sw:254 cw:224 GW:160. Hi all. Ive been on keto since August 20th,  2020. Weight has been slower to come off than some of my fellow keto'ers but I am trying to be patient with myself. I have PCOS, endometriosis, and have a history of extreme yoyo dieting/eating disorder. I am determined to make this lifestyle work for me, primarily for my health and my family. I have been practicing IF of 16:8 4-5 days week with at least 1 24hr fast each week. I have also started endurance and strength training 3 days a week this past November. My question is, can dairy slow progress and has anyone had better results without it? I have been tracking macros and calories and been sticking to strict keto but i am desperate to see quicker results. I am honestly starting to get discouraged. Is there something else I can/should be doing? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Btw, my macros are F117 P120 C20 TC1600."

keto,Clean Keto in hotel?,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to transition back into the keto lifestyle but in a cleaner manner this time. However, I will be living in a hotel room for the next 4 months as I work 72 hours a week at a nearby hospital. I will have a full refrigerator and 2 stove eyes for cooking, thankfully. However, I will not have a vehicle to do grocery pickup and the only choices I have for grocery delivery are Walmart and something called Wegman's.

&amp;#x200B;

I was trying to make out my grocery list while simultaneously making out my meal plan for the next month. But I wanted to reach out and see if anybody here had any recommendations for meals/foods considering my restrictions.

keto,An emotional binge eater needs help,"Emotional binge eating has been a problem most of my adult life. The holidays make it worse between all the awkward family gatherings and the due date of my lost baby coming up. I need help. Does anyway have good podcasts or books that might help? I feel like I start to make great progress and then days like today happen and I feel so defeated. 

Therapy doesn’t seem to work because my binge eating comes on by high stress events which may happen in a time frame where I can’t talk to someone. Just taking walks and showers and that kind of advice didn’t work for me. I’m looking for something I can listen to or read the immediate moment I need it."
keto,DAE get occasionally tired as they lose weight?,"Not from over-exertion but just a feeling of, you can feel your weight-loss - if that makes sense, and occasionally need a day of doing nothing or just low effort day now and again to feel kinda balanced?"
keto,Does anyone have any advice or experience in risking eating sugar?,"Since I started eating Keto three months ago I’ve found my sugar cravings totally non-existent. I’m used to desperately wanting sweet snacks on a diet (like eating a whole 6-pack of “diet” popcorn desperate) but Keto has totally curbed my desire to snack. It’s amazing and I’m really happy. 

That being said, I like to join in at social events. I have eaten sugar 3-4 times since I started this WOE but each time has been... weird. It’s been like eating sugar right after brushing my teeth or something. I did taste it but it didn’t taste quite right and it definitely didn’t make me feel good in the way it used to. The closest to good was the highest fat/lowest sugar dessert I ate (churros). 

Crucially, on previous diets “cheats” like that would be the beginning of the end. I would wake up on a sugar low - hungover - and then eat more sugar the next day. That hasn’t happened for me this time. I’ve woken up and snapped back to eating Keto with zero problems. 

Right now I’m home and surrounded by chocolate and snacks. I don’t really feel much of a desire to eat any of it but I expect that I will eat some on Christmas and Boxing Day to “join in.” However, I’m a bit anxious about it because my “cheats” before have been ONE meal on ONE day. This has the potential to be a lot more than that depending on how I feel once I’m drunk and festive. I’m worried that if I eat sugar for too long, or on too many occasions, it will get control of me again. 

Sorry this is a super long post - has anyone else experienced the weird death of sugar cravings? Have they come back?"
keto,Potassium?,"The FAQ says to get 1000mg of potassium, but mostly everything else I find online recommends 3000mg+. Can anybody explain why the discrepancy? And how much potassium is too much potassium? 

I’ve been doing keto for almost 2 months and am just today experimenting with “ketoade.” I’ve been feeling fatigued at times and often getting headaches. 

Appreciate your advice on the potassium or anything related."

keto,I stopped losing weight after first month,"Hi,
I am 30 years old male. I am 5' 6"" and my weight at start was 260lb with 40% fat.

I have been doing keto for 10 weeks, but It seems that my body is stopped losing weight. I only lose about 15 lb, while 12 lb were in the first 4 weeks.

I eat at max 20 carbs, 110 protein, 110 fat. I have never been out of ketosis since I start as I always test it with keto tube reader.

It is frustrating, and I am not sure if I should continue doing it or not. I know that I do not do enough excercises but I was not gaining or losing any weight before starting the keto not matter what I eat. (I usually don't eat a lot and my daily calories in take does not reach 1500.

I anyone had similar situation, please advise."
keto,Keto after kidney donation?,"I have reason to believe that I may be donating one of my kidneys in the foreseeable future. I'm aware that generally keto isn't a problem for people with healthy kidneys, but I'm not sure if that changes once you are down to one kidney.

I'm just looking for information at this stage. My research suggests that most people can do just fine with one kidney, but not much is said about diet after donation.

Obviously I will discuss it with a medical professional in the future, this is just part of my research ahead of time."
keto,glad i didn't give up! plateau / SV and NSV,"m35 SW 305 cs 289  gw 199

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone.  On Halloween I was 305 but I was about 310 a couple weeks before that.  I cut out some snacks and lost 10 pounds in like a week! I skipped a couple meals.  

I got serious about keto at 305 and went down to 295 pretty fast.  However, I spent almost 24? days alternating between 293 and 295.  

I finally broke through and fell out of the 290s.  What I did was follow your advice.  I prioritized getting over 100g of protein while keeping my calories pretty low.  I found some recipes and made some meals that allowed a great amount of protein.  Plus I make some shakes that have extra electrolytes, collagen and other goodies.  I started taking 2 tbsp of ACV + the mother every other night. 

I swim a few times a week, go for long walks and that's about it. my job is sadly sedentary. 

I did have some success with alternating days of intermittent fasting or extra deficit for cals.  I know this might not look super sustainable or favorable to some of you but keep in mind i was a whopping 310 pounds and I have plenty of stored fat on my body to survive having a couple days a week where i only eat about 900 cals.  

I go from about 14-1500 cals to 900.  I track them the best I can but because I am human and make mistakes I find aiming super low a few days a week is giving me some wiggle room so I am averaging about 1200 a day etc. maybe a little higher sometimes, a little less other times.  

In any case I went from 295 to 289 in the 7 day span I have done this.  

The keto yogurts and bars are great but if you can learn to just prepare high quality meats and veggies, pound that water and watch your electrolytes that is far  better than eating out and trusting the restaurants. 

Getting down to 275 by February 1st is my current goal, and I believe I can do it!  Once I get down to 250 I think I can exercise much more healthily than at my current weight"
keto,4’11 not losing weight but Keto community got me in the right track.,"Hey everyone, I posted a few weeks ago about how I wasn’t seeing any changes with Keto and I got tons of helpful replies. I got a food weigh and decreased my calorie intake by a lot. You guys encouraged me to keep going and now I’m down to 106 lbs. It’s been a very slow weight loss process (maybe cause I’m so short) but it’s weight loss nonetheless. It takes some patience but the pounds come off eventually, half a pound or so a week. Thanks to everyone who helped me out in the original post. You rock!

keto,Has anyone tried Strength Training while on keto?,"I did keto/low carb back in 2017 with great success with regard to weight loss. I didn’t lift weights though. I’m currently into strength training.

Okey, no problem, cause I am not going to eat it.

Except I accidentally tasted it.

And felt nothing. Like, it did not taste sweet. Weird! Like no high. Started to wonder if this was a suger version of methodone.

You would deliver each post as a Word document along with the images, and somebody else would take care of properly getting it posted on the blog.

keto,Keto progress: 20lbs down!,"SW: 358 CW: 338 GW: 180  


I started Keto on Dec. 10. It's been nearly 2 weeks and already 20lbs down. I can't believe it's working, and I tried a lot before this (atkins, low-carb, weight watchers, ACV and fasting). None of it worked. Now, being on Keto, I'm already seeing results and it's fantastic. Gonna wait for the 3 and 6 month mark to take pictures to really see my progress, but this is amazing!"
keto,"Going over the emotional pump, how snacking affects us.","Hey, I'm 55 days into Keto, I lost tons of weight, I'm walking like crazy out of excess energy (127km this December according to Google Fit)  


Yesterday I had to go to the doctor, after my visit my emotions were high and I went for my Starbucks Almond latte, no luck, so I went into a supermarket looking for keto snacks.  
The Carb addiction doc on YouTube had this saying that a snack is almost always an emotional event, I never understood  this till now.

  
My Starbucks was to some degree my bridge something I take to get over any emotional disturbance, failing to get my hands on my fix  I went in a local supermarket looking  for dark chocolate, I found a CANDEREL 0% sugar bar,  had one and  it was great, like addictively great.  
I grabbed a few of them with different tastes, got another bar in the car and finished it  really fast (like I couldn't believe I was done with it) tried yet another and it tasted bad and familiar... OOPS it's a MILK CHOCOLATE bar&gt;  


Guys snacking while having an emotional event usually leads to poor food choices like not reading labels... even though it had no sugar, my colon went haywire, I'm still struggling with it today, the funny thing was I always felt bad drinking Lattes but I always thought it was the caffeine turns out I was lactose intolerant to the max.

Now feeling bad and annoyed I went home and binged on some keto food, went to sleep and tried to restart the day, but I was moody and emotional even my coworkers noticed it, the constant growling from my stomach didn't help... I had my breakfast at noon and then finished my work and played some Dota2 when I got home.

  
I had a soccer game of my favorite team coming up, but they haven't been the best lately and I always get mad watching their games...(they won yay...)  so instead of watching it and getting even more emotional I decided I would go to a walk during the game and only checking up on them after the game was over.

I got my phone and earphones and went for a walk ( I listen to Fake Doctors Real friends podcast which you should totally listen to if you're a fan of Scrubs )  


9km into my walk, I felt the best endorphin rush ever, it was so great I laughed like an idiot, somehow walking has become so pleasurable to me that it basically saved my day and helped me see the big picture which I guess I'm going to sum up:  


Don't invite Keto look a likes to your diet, if your problems are emotion based you will over eat them and they are usually not great for you.

Food should not taste so good you can't stop, even if it was Keto friendly.  


Don't try new products in your car or in the super market, give yourself time to read labels and learn about the products

  
Heightened emotions can be treated in healthier ways, find an endorphin activator that doesn't require eating.  


Find multiple bridges to cross emotional tension instead of relying on one bridge that you may fail to get.

keto,Will Eating a Keto Calorie Surplus Occasionally Hinder Progress?,"Hi All, I'm trying to get back into keto after some successful bouts in years past. Currently I am somewhat active (hiking/jogging/resistance work) and I've done IF pretty religiously for almost two years, but I seem to have plateaued and even gained a little weight lately.

 I am in a routine of staying very close to my calorie limits/benchmarks most days but then every once in a while (especially on days when I work out) my appetite just goes nuts (most days I eat between 1800-2000 cals and then on these other days, anywhere from 2500-3000cals). 

If I do the same thing on keto, but ""overeat"" foods that are still keto-appropriate, will it hinder fat burning and weight loss? These more-intake days occur I'd say, once every 5 days or so. 

My main goal here is fat loss/weight loss. I'm currently 5'11"" \~188lbs. 

Thanks."

I read the ingredients list and see that it will have pieces of dried fruit or fruit peels and wonder how many carbs would it be, if any considering the amount. I avoid teas that state they have any kind of sugar added (like candied fruit, caramel, maple syrup) but was wondering about the dried fruit aspect. Any insight would be helpful."
keto,Monk Fruit or Stevia Cause Gastro Pains?,"I've been using a Keto lifestyle since mid-July.

I tend to rotate between the two of them but lately i've been getting stomach pain around my belly button.

keto,The importance of micronutrients: an abstract,"https://www.pnas.org/content/103/47/17589

I thought this paper was interesting and wanted to share. I admit that I don't track my micronutrients like I should, but I am going to do better. 

---

Inadequate dietary intakes of vitamins and minerals are widespread, most likely due to excessive consumption of energy-rich, micronutrient-poor, refined food. Inadequate intakes may result in chronic metabolic disruption, including mitochondrial decay. Deficiencies in many micronutrients cause DNA damage, such as chromosome breaks, in cultured human cells or in vivo. Some of these deficiencies also cause mitochondrial decay with oxidant leakage and cellular aging and are associated with late onset diseases such as cancer. I propose DNA damage and late onset disease are consequences of a triage allocation response to micronutrient scarcity."
keto,How much can I expect to gain?,"So I’ve been doing keto for about 6 months. I’m taking a break until the second week of January. And honestly, I’m super scared about gaining my weight back. 

I know it’s very unlikely I would gain 45 pounds in a month, but being obese all of my life, I’ve really really enjoyed being thinner. Like recently, I’ve fit into 1X shirts for the first time since 7th grade. 

I think I would be able to better adapt, if I could just have an idea of how much I can expect to gain. I’m still going to do 20/4 and OMAD during this time.

Here is what I'm struggling with, I'm an emotional eater and always have been. Wtf do I do with these emotions now that I don't have food for comfort anymore. I'm losing weight for sure, but I am so very unhappy. Idk what to do. I'm not quitting keto, and I'm not going back to he food but seriously, what do I do???"

keto,Am I doing keto properly?,"I started last Tuesday. That Tuesday I had cabbage soup, the next day I ate plain honey mustard chicken with green beans, then the next day I had eggs with ham and cheese along with some turkey and cheese roll ups, then the next day I ate cheeseburger no bun, salad with Honey mustard and chicken. 
I also am only drinking diet soda, water, or sparkling water, or crystal light with my one meal a day  I just cut out diet soda completely and switched to sparkling water and water. 
Saturday I had a cauliflower pizza, then on Sunday I ate cheeseburger bowls with zucchini fries. Then last night I ate keto cheesecake and philly cheese steak stuffed peppers with zucchini fries. 

Today I ate scrambled eggs with cheese, later I'm having keto meat loaf and green beans. 

Am I doing this right? Starting tomorrow I'm going to be more strict with my intermittent fasting. 

I felt like I may have eaten too much yesterday. 

I cut out processed sugars, bad carbs like bread pasta rice etc, and I'm only eating under 30 carbs a day I believe.

The first time back in 2018 my results seemed better and faster but I never weighed myself and ate a dirty keto diet. This time I have tracked my weight loss every day and tracked all my carbs. While I have lost 50 pounds in a little over 3 months,  the scale has not moved in 9 days. I am stuck at 250. I have not changed anything in my diet. Does this sound normal?? I am really missing some fries and if I'm not losing weight anymore I am really debating giving up. My target weight is around 210-220 for being 6 ft."

Lately it has been my SEN school Christmas dinner and my daughter's 10th birthday. I let myself have a day off for both as the kids really want me to be involved. I was really worried about gain, but I remained stable even though I'm clearly not going to be in ketosis. I'm being strict for a few days and I'm going to have Christmas day and boxing day off. 

What I really learned is that it's a lifestyle. The world doesn't end if I slip up, I just get back on and ride the mini keto flu. My main problem is that I need to eat more as I don't get hungry very often! Need to up my fats!!"

This is all done with just eating as ketogenic as possible. I'm sure I wasn't perfect cause I don't exactly track things like I should. But in trying to keep my carbs as low as possible cutting out all the stuff I love, and then finding suitable replacements for some of those. It's a world of difference.

So Reddit friends, give me some advice? Should I follow it as close as possible for the few days? Should I break my diet and begin again in 4 days doing a sort of system restart? Will it affect my weight loss?

keto,My experience/opinions with Keto. (24 F),"I first started keto 3 years ago because I was fat and depressed. The first 3 weeks, I was counting everything to make sure I was doing “ real keto “. I lost 10 pounds and I felt great. Then I started fasting 16:8 and that’s when I really started to noticed a difference in my body and energy. After about 2 months I lost 40 pounds and been the thinnest I’ve been in. I went from size 14 to 8. Had to buy all new clothes because nothing fit me anymore and I was excited to show off my new body. 

But then.
I started seeing a boy, not just any boy but the one I had a crush on since I was 17. I stopped keto because he always wanted to take me out and make me drinks (he’s a bartender). Then I had this fear that I’m gonna gain all the weight back. Soon after, work for me got really busy and I only ate once I got home. It just felt like IF thats all. I continued to lose another 15 pounds with just IF alone with no restrictions on what I ate which was mostly carbs tbh.


I kept the weight off for 3 years just up until the beginning of this year. Then we had to shutdown everything, I was home for 4 months in total. I moved into my boyfriend’s house and would cook breakfast lunch dinner and desserts almost everyday. Once summer hit, I tried on my summer clothes but didn’t fit me anymore. So I panicked and tried to do keto again but it didn’t last more than a day because I felt so hungry all the time. 

For the past month, I been strictly fasting 16:8 because it fits with my busy functioning alcoholic lifestyle. I stop feeling hungry every hour and felt more energized. I stop weighting myself but I can see that I’m losing weight again. My favorite pair of jeans at one point only came up past my knees and now they button! 

This week I started keto again and today is day 3, one of the toughest day. My fiancé loves my body the way it is but I know I can look better and be healthier too. 

Moral of the story: Sometimes IF alone can help you like its helping me"
keto,Quarantine weight gain (keto),"I was doing keto before the pandemic. It totally works.

keto,My 2020 story 240-&gt;200lb,"Early in 2020 I was afraid to get on the scales. I didn’t stay for long enough for them to record my weight, so I can’t say for sure my starting weight but it was around 240lb.

My clothes were tight, I snored like a boar and my back hurt like hell every morning. I had a COVID-like flu in January after returning from international travel and had breathlessness through June. It was time to make a change.

I’ve yoyoed in weight since I started traveling for work - putting on 5lb on average for the last 8 years. Sometimes losing 10lb only to put it back on, and then some.

By June I’d shed 15lb just by exercising and was feeling better. But come September I was stuck around the 220lb mark and I had lunch with a friend who had tried Keto near the end of September.

For October I went on a hard keto diet and bam. I lost 13lb in October alone and then another 7lb in November and December combined (not such strict keto).

Now I’m 200lb and 16% body fat, and I can wear clothes I haven’t worn in years. The muffin top is gone and I ran 3 miles in 22 minutes a few weeks ago.

I’m trying to figure out my goals for 2021. 16% body fat is hardly Men’s Fitness so I’m wondering if I might go to cut the body fat a few % and go for ripped. Will see.

Anyhow here are a few of my thoughts about keto weight loss. Hope they help.

1) With keto you never feel hungry. If you do portion control you won’t end up craving.

2) What is dragging you back? I found it was pizza, bread and beer. Don’t give them up, just cut back. Don’t make this about not enjoying the foods you love.

3) There are keto recipes for anything. Pancakes? Check. Garlic Bread? Check. And they are delicious. Non-Keto members of the family will approve.

4) Keto ensures you will never undereat protein, which means you can put on muscle whilst losing weight. Win!

5) Don’t worry if you miss your goals one day. Long term gains are made from long term trajectories, they are delayed by misses but not lost. They are only lost if you give up.

6) You pretty much can’t overeat on salmon. Try it.

7) When you want to transition off keto you can keep the good parts. Slice the bread thinner. Drink one beer instead of four. Share a pizza between two instead of eating it all yourself.

8) Exercise on keto is amazing. I did a 70 mile bike ride one day and only snacked a normal amount. The only downside is your maximum intensity is slightly limited.

9) Apple Watch helped me a lot to ensure I got the right amount of exercise.

I really hope these thoughts help someone else on their journey. I just went back to my progress photos taken on November 8th and you can see a good difference. Looking forward to setting new goals for 2021!"
keto,Will eating the same number of calories on a keto diet vs. a low-fat diet result in the same weight loss?,"I have been reading old posts on the forum about this question and I know that it's been asked before and also discussed in various capacities, but I also know that the composition of this subreddit has changed over years, and maybe the science has developed more also, so I'm curious about what people's takes are on this question. 

I understand that calories / CICO are important, and I also understand that hormones play a role. There seems to be two schools of thought in the posts / comments in this subreddit: One school seems to be saying that keto is just easy CICO due to fats / real foods being more satiating and nutritious (and thus it's easier to eat fewer calories because people don't feel hungry. 

The other school seems to be saying that 'calories don't matter' (although I think they're usually being hyperbolic; I think what they mean is that if a person was to maintain their current calorie intake but change the macros to align with a ketogenic diet they would start losing weight instead of maintaining their current weight). 

So yeah, I know all of that is complex and maybe even controversial, but I just want to know what people's thoughts are: Will eating the same number of calories on a keto diet vs. a low-fat diet result in the same weight loss?"

keto,Recording carbs with MyFitnessPal- total carbs vs. net carbs confusion...,"The keto calculator set my daily carb ceiling at 29 g. I'm using MyFitnessPal to keep track of my food, and it seems like it's using total carbs rather than net carbs. I end up getting to the daily limit long before I have reached my calorie or protein goals. Is it only net carbs I should be counting toward my daily limit, and if so, how do I do that if MyFitnessPal is counting total carbs?"
keto,If you ruin keto “a little” do you eat back into ketosis faster?,"I’m sure the answer is obvious, but I want to ask to be sure. If I break keto one day by only like, 10g carbs, will I get back into ketosis in like 2 days versus 4 days by breaking is by 70g carbs, for example????
Inspiration: Might break it BARELY on Christmas Day."
keto,Motivation needed,"So recently I have been eating over my calories and carbs. Not sure if its because I feel like I look like Im at a good weight now that I lost so much but Im not at my goal yet. I usually am on track to hit my macros but then around 9 pm I am starving and eat over. Any advice or motivation to lose the last 14 pounds would be appreciated. Also any advice to keep it off would be helpful also. I havent gained weight back just have been staying at 179 for 6 weeks.

keto,Keto &amp; COVID-19,"Hi r/keto, 

I've recently acquired the infamous COVID-19 virus and wanted to document my experience. I believe my symptoms so far have been less mild than the average person since the inflammation I usually experienced has been mitigated to my diet. WHat I mean by this is that my sore throat lasted less than a day and did not impact my voice or discomfort when swallowing food or drink. 

I have a spreadsheet that I am going to compile day over day with timestamps, temperatures, and what I ate. Let me know if you are interested in such a thing."
keto,Thinking about quiting. Words of encouragement/advice?,"Hey guys, 10 days in here and I feel like piss. I think I skipped  the infamous keto flu stage thanks to some decent prep work and already being low carb; however, my sleep has suffered greatly. Most nights will be around 3 hours. I've been supplementing melatonin but its given me headaches and negating the mental clarity that I started keto for. Any words of encouragement? What do you guys think?"
keto,Successful weight loss with keto after discontinuing SSRI?,"Has anyone successfully lost the weight they gained from being on an SSRI-type of antidepressant by doing keto? 

I’m desperate and could really use some encouragement. I’m tapering off Lexapro (escitalopram) and am just feeling so discouraged. I was able to lose weight with keto last year but it was insanely slow. After the pandemic hit and my life changed a lot, my eating just went to shit. I’m now struggling to get back to keto. First time I tried to post this it got deleted first being too short of a post (???) so ignore my ramblings. The main question is the top line of the post. Thanks in advance."
keto,Can you become fat adapted on low carb?,"Do you have to be in ketosis to become fat adapted?

For example, if I was to do 18:6 IF and keep my carbs to under 75 net, mostly just complex carbs from vegetables, not like, table sugar, would I still become fat adapted? I hear it's a scale, not a switch, so I should still receive some benefits right?"
keto,BEWARE of Sugar Alcohols!,"In another thread, one of our type-I diabetic keto-brethren who uses an insulin pump -- and therefore is very well-aware of just exactly how different foods affect his blood sugar -- said that Costco's protein bars (a knockoff of Quest Bars) cause his blood sugar to spike, in spite of the manufacturer's claims that they are low-carb and keto-friendly.

I looked up the ingredients list for this particular brand of protein bar, and as I suspected, they contain erythritol, which is a type of ""sugar alcohol."" Sugar alcohols are often used to sweeten products meant to be diabetic- and ketogenic-friendly.

I have read reports from prominent physicians who prescribe ketogenic diets to their patients saying that contrary to popular belief, sugar alcohols are NOT keto-friendly and will cause your blood sugar to spike as though you've consumed actual sugar.

Another possible factor for those of us whose pancreatic islets produce insulin -- as opposed to our friend with the insulin pump -- is that the mere taste of sweetness on the tongue can trigger insulin production, regardless of the carbohydrate content of the sweetener.

So that you can avoid consuming sugar alcohols, here is a list of them to look for in product ingredient lists:

**Sorbitol**

**Mannitol**

**Maltitol**

**Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates**

**Erythritol**

**Xylitol**

**Isomalt**

**Lactitol**

Personally, I avoid all gimmicky ""fake foods"" made for diabetics and low-carb dieters, in favor of eating real, normal foods. This means I don't get any bread or diet soda or other sweet stuff, aside from small amounts of berries, etc. but I'm not one of those people who crave what they can't have. There's so much protein and fat in my diet that I don't go hungry and never feel deprived.

Your mileage may vary."
keto,Keto IV drops (Mineral supplement),"I’ve been doing lazy keto for about 6 weeks and have hit a bit of a plateau, so I’m meal prepping and watching my consumption of carbs. I ran across Keto IV drops while looking into ordering zipfizz (i find it to be the easiest way for me to get an everyday dosage of minerals). Has anyone tried the IV drops? For 15$/30 servings, while zipfizz is double the cost, I might just try it."
keto,Coffee &amp; Fasting,"First, I normally drink my coffee black. I've been doing 16/8 IF for the past two weeks. I was considering adding heavy cream to my coffee to bump up my fat intake. Do you think my body will think that it's ""eating"" (hope that makes sense)? I can only drink coffee before 8AM or it upsets my stomach. I usually start eating around 11AM. Thanks for your input."
keto,Keto PSYLLIUM Husk Rate,"So I have been staying keto for almost 2 months and down from 245-255 to 230.

I definitely feel better and fit better in my clothing.

I started to feel constipated , so I took a table spoon of psyllium husk and felt a ton better.

How often should I take a teaspoon? Once a day? Once a week? I see some people make pancakes.

I generally only eat eggs, cheese , meat and protirn shakes so unless I get an advocato or kimchi, it is pretty hard to get a good amount of fiber.

Any advice? Psyllium husk feels like a nuclear option due to how fast it works but I am wondering if feeling backed up is also bad."
keto,Struggling to get my fat nacros,"What is a good idea to add to my lunch and dinner that adds a lot of fat. I seem to be trying to catch by eating string cheese, yogurt, cottage cheese, etc... in bits and pieces instead of reaching it with 2 meals. 

I’m trying to reach 115g per day."
keto,Do non-dairy AND low carb cheese replacements exist?,"Can anybody recommend their go-to non-dairy shredded/sliced cheeses that *aren't* carb-heavy? I'm on keto and I'm trying to replace my dairy intake with alternatives because I suspect I have a mild lactose intolerance.  
I found one that my local grocer carries -- this Violife Grated Cheese: [http://prntscr.com/w6q4kz](http://prntscr.com/w6q4kz) \-- but it's potato starch based, and pretty carb heavy compared to my usual zero carb dairy cheeses. I've heard there are soy and nut-based cheeses out there, though."
keto,Did this diet truly improve your seizures?,"I have seizures where I space out for ten seconds and my mouth tingles and my hand shakes. 

Does anyone have those seizures that tried this diet? I'm wondering if I legitimately need to do it for health reasons. I can't go to a doctor to ask. Any insight would be great."
keto,Been going at it for 10 months,"I’ve lost roughly 100 pounds in a year. I still have a bit of stomach left, but I want to get out of keto correctly. I want to focus on building muscle now. I had one cheat meal throughout the entire journey and it was on my birthday. Any recommendations to come out of keto and not gain it all back? I try and workout every single day. I’m 18 btw if that helps in any way?"
keto,"Migraines, just wanted to share","So I went on keto because my doc decided that since I wasn't in college at the moment, I shouldn't be on Adderall anymore (don't get me started-I just graduated as a RN, but you know, I don't need to focus while trying to NOT KILL PEOPLE. Not like I'll be learning more as a new RN either, right? Ugh). However, I also have idiopathic intracranial hypertension (read: I make too much spinal cord fluid, which puts pressure on my brain and eyes) and for whatever reason, Adderall helps control both that, and the ocular migraines I would get if not on the med. These ocular migraines were flat out debilitating, lasting 4+ hours at a time, and making me essentially useless, with no apparent trigger. Obviously, this isn't ok for a nurse, but my oh-so-craptastic doctor ignored this. While working on finding a new doc, I decided to give keto a shot, since research has shown some possible benefits for both migraines and my other head issue. 

It's been a month since I've had any meds. I haven't had a single ocular migraine. Normally, I would have one within a week of being off the meds. I'm also finding that my pressures are staying pretty low-I can tell when they get worse not just from the increased headache, but because I get tinnitus as the pressure increases. No tinnitus, no worsening headache, just my baseline mild headache I've had for 16+ years.  The only time I've had a worse headache is when I didn't get enough sodium or fluids; correcting that corrects the headache.   


Obviously, I'm still early in, and YMWV, but damn, for me, this is amazing."
keto,Alcohol combined with wrong order of wings and consequences,Had two large vodka/soda with lime yesterday and ordered 10 naked wings smothered in garlic Parmesan sauce at BWW. Wing stop garlic Parmesan is a dry power rub with almost zero carbs. Didn’t realize BWW sauce had added sugar. 4 lbs gained oh well it’s just water. 😔 I have my first DEXA scan post keto tomorrow. Will post the details.
keto,"T1 diabetic who ruined Costco ""quest bar"" knock offs, back to discuss the Aldi Keto bread:","Sorry it took so long to get back to you all, it's been over a year since I ruined Costco protein bars for the sub at large. Many of you asked if I would try Aldi's keto bread and report back, and I finally have.

As you may recall from my last experiment, I found after weeks of eating costco's brand of questbar-style protein bars, that the blood sugar readings I got didn't line up with their listed net carb counts. (I get the privilege of taking insulin from a pump instead of making my own, so I know how much I take at all times.) Whenever I ate a quest bar, I would take the prescribed dosage of insulin for the carbs listed. Then my blood sugar would inevitably reach 200-250 within an hour or so, and I would take as much insulin to correct those readings as if I had just eaten straight sugar. So don't eat them, if you want to keep your insulin low!

So let's talk Aldi Keto bread:

IT'S LEGIT. I can't take insulin for it or my blood sugar drops as if I forgot to eat. When I eat this bread, I take no insulin, and my blood sugars still stay stable. 

So enjoy, my keto friends. It may taste kinda like ass, but I don't have to worry about my blood sugar, so it's sort of a fair trade off, I guess."
keto,It’s working!,"6’1” SW: 351 CW:267 GW:225

The pandemic has been a godsend for me. (And I feel guilty about that as it’s been so hard on so many). But I usually travel 200+ days a year which led to years of bad nutrition and excise habits. 

I’ve been very disciplined in diet since mid-Feb and now I’m adding in the exercise I need as the weight loss is starting to slow a little. 

Thanks for encouragement everyone!"
keto,Finally in onederland!,"I finally made it to onederland, which means my goal isn't far off! I am off work for 2 weeks which means I want to really take advantage of my quarantined life and do a 2 week pilates challenge. Anyone wanna be my workout buddy???"
keto,"Stupid question, but going to ask anyway","So my dad bought chickens that are stuffed with bread, if I just eat the chicken with no stuffing it's still keto, right? Probably, but wanted to check with the experts. I really like this diet and have been sticking to it pretty well so I really don't want to mess up even unintentionally. Thanks!"
keto,Conflicting Info!,"I'm about a week into ketosis now and loving it! I'm still figuring out how to eat, though, and finding a lot of conflicting information on the Intardwebz.

It's meat meat meat for me, some cheese (mainly hard cheddar and brie), and small portions of leafy greens. I thought I didn't like asparagus my whole life, but have discovered that it was because I'd only ever had it boiled until it was mushy; asparagus sauteed in butter is a revelation of tastiness, and I am a big fan now. I often sautee mushrooms and/or onions with my generous portions of meat, which I generally cook in either bacon fat, butter, or coconut oil.

I've been a BIG milk drinker my entire life. Nonfat and low-fat -- ""the blue water"" -- have never been acceptable to me; only whole milk will do. Looking at carb info, though, has prompted me to seriously cut back on my milk intake. It's my big treat once per day to have 1 - 1.5 cups of whole milk; I've switched to heavy cream in my coffee.

The [keto calculator tool](https://calculo.io/keto-calculator) I found here in this subreddit was a big help in getting started; according to that I can have up to 26 grams of carbs per day. I've been keeping it below 20 grams anyway.

I'm not craving anything; there are some things that would be nice -- like more milk, and fruit, and just bready sugary anything -- but I don't feel deprived at all. I'm eating hearty and loving it! I don't feel hungry and can easily turn my nose up at foods I do like but can't eat on this diet.

The issue right now is that I have a cantaloupe in the refrigerator that needs eating. In my first few days of the diet, I googled up some information about foods to eat and avoid, and found a list that included watermelon and cantaloupe as keto-friendly fruits, along with berries. Well, that's not entirely right, is it? Cantaloupe has like 14 grams of carbs per cup; why is it listed on some of these sites as keto-friendly?

The same is true of the whole milk I love so much. My initial, very cursory research also listed whole milk as keto-friendly. Baloney Mahoney malarkey! I used to drink like a quart a day -- sometimes more -- of whole milk, and that would completely ruin my ketosis if I did it now.

Does anyone have a rough rule-of-thumb for how much cantaloupe I can eat without balling it? Like, how big a slice can I have if I keep my milk consumption down to, say, 11 grams of carbs?

Are there any really reliable sites that you use with very large lists of foods that are acceptable?"
keto,Keto at Topgolf?,I’m going out to topgolf tonight with some friends and I was looking at the nutrition to see what was low carb there and the wings without any breading have 9 grams of sugar! Then I looked at the burgers and they have 11 grams of sugar! Why does a burger need sugar!? Has anyone been to topgolf before and if so any suggestions on what to eat? Worse case scenario I eat before I go
keto,when you’re fat a lot of women like to stand near you.it makes them feel thin(my story)," 

So here we are after having gone through Reddit, again and again, I realized that many people like me have been badly in their bodies because of overweight due to pregnancy, illness or snacking ( I also have this little weakness: D).

[I just want to share my story with you](https://medium.com/@ziyad_50572/when-youre-fat-a-lot-of-women-like-to-stand-near-you-it-makes-them-feel-thin-my-story-d41b593b7613), I promise I won’t sell anything but I give my positivity.

So here I am Sam I’m 27 years old I’m the mother of two beautiful children of 5 and 7 years old, I’m a big woman, I’m 1m83 tall and I’ve always been between 58 and 62 kg, without diet without sport."
keto,Addicted to sugar no more,"just wanted to share my little story, this is my second time going keto (first time was set up for failure). all my life I've been ADDICTED to sugar, like eating multiple giant bars of chocolate in one sitting, then literally scavenging for anything I can find to get more of it, even as far as eating literal sugar. going down to the corner store at 2AM and buying a bag full of chocolate bars, onion rings, M&amp;Ms, literally anything to get a fix.

I've got a big environment change recently, new city, new life, and got on keto again two months ago. the sugar addiction is gone completely now, because of keto. it's so gone that I can have a bunch of chocolate - the best european kind - in front of me and it won't even occur to me to eat some. it lifted a huge weight off my shoulders, it made my mood a ton more stable as well as my energy levels. I combine it with IF, honestly just because it makes things a ton easier on top.

Long story short; keto made my life-long sugar addiction go away, I feel a ton better and don't have any kind of cravings whatsoever (except the munchies that I supply with almonds and brazil nuts haha). I don't really count any macros tho, because I just don't need to. I just pay attention to have only keto-friendly stuff at home and that's it. body fat is going away as well.

thanks keto."
keto,Exogenous Ketones,"
Hello,
I’m wondering if anyone has experience with taking exogenous ketones. I’ve hit a bit of a roadblock with my weight loss and I’m looking to switch things up! I don’t have a whole lot of weight to lose, about 15lbs total and I’m currently at a normal BMI .... this is purely vanity weight.

keto,Struggling after trying to get back into it,"I 1st started keto over 3 years ago now. I lost about 60-70 pounds. I fell off the wagon and I have been trying to get back on and off for a bit now. I've gained back a decent amount of the weight I had lost. 

I've been back on track and I have noticed it is not like it was the 1st time at all..

Has anyone else noticed a resistance when trying to get back into it? Like did my body adapt to cutting carbs? I'm still trying and making an effort but am admittedly a little discouraged.

keto,Is it possible to eat 6 eggs and 100g of bacon each meal?,"I'm 20+% bodyfat, don't have a scale right now but I can tell from looking in the mirror. Gyms are closed, so I walk maybe 5km every day. I eat 6 eggs and 100g of bacon for breakfast and in the evening 200g of lamb leg.

Can I instead eat 6 eggs and 100g bacon both meals? It's certainly cheaper, but is it sustainable?"

Anyone got any advice on how to flatten the belly? Would the egg fast be suitable to get losing again? Possibly intermittent fasting im not sure."
keto,"Depression and tiredness on keto (6 months on it), what did I overlook?","So I am following a carnivorish-keto diet for a good amount of 6 months. At the first couple of months I felt amazing, anxiety gone, alot of weightloss, improved wellbeing, etc. 

But after like 4 months I became depressed, I tried taking more electrolytes (via supplements and also via using more salt with trace minerals and also the lite salt, and this didnt work). 

I also tried eating various organ meats once per week and that also didnt work.

So I eventually started incorporating more vegetables (I limited myself to asparagus, broccoli, avocado) and I also started adding nightshades in my diet. This also didnt work.

I also ate the right amount of fat on keto-carnivorish (70% +)

So I decided to cheat last week by drinking beer and eating pizza, and I feel much much much better. And I have quit keto ever since. 

But I still want to try keto again, but this time with the knowledge of what I did wrong before, since keto did improve alot of things to me."

keto,Coming to terms with this being long term,"I have IBS symptoms and I also am doing keto for weight loss and I haven't had the symptoms since starting keto. I've been on keto for about a month now and lost 11.5lbs probably mostly water weight so far.

Yesterday I ate a bit of cake that someone  got for me and some mince pies because its Christmas. Within an hour my stomach was so uncomfortable and I realised that I need to stick to keto even after I lost the weight. 

I don't know how to do this long term. I love my carbs which is probably why I gained weight. I've been enjoying the keto food but I still miss my pasta and pizza. And I'm a fairly good cook but all the recipes I know have carbs. 

Anyone else had to change to keto long term? Does it get easier?"

keto,Appetite has dropped like magic - but is it possible to eat too little on keto?,"I know keto isn't supposed to slow your metabolism when you restrict calories - that's part of the point. But this is just SO foreign to anything I've ever experienced. I'm 4 weeks into keto, have done a 3 day fast, and am now doing IF 20:4. My appetite is so small that it's work to take in less than half the calories I'm expending. Not complaining!  It's a wonderful feeling, and the weight is melting off.

keto,CICO and binge eating,"CW: binge eating

Hi,

I struggle a lot with binge eating due to emotional stress. I don’t always eat much, just super high calorie foods. Nothing to do with hunger or anything. But my emotional stress has been here for most of my life and it’s not looking like it’s gonna disappear soon.

I really need to lose weight. Keto is my last alternative. Is it correct that you still need to eat in a big calorie deficit? Again, regular food is fine, it’s the binges that rack up the numbers. Have any of you found that keto helps with binging? I’ve also seen low carb chocolate and stuff; is it worth getting or is I better to quit cold turkey? 

Thanks"
keto,Ketosis versus just high fat/moderate protein,"I'm curious about the feelings of people on this subreddit on whether ketosis is truly the magic of the keto diet, or if it's just about a high fat/low carb diet causing much greater satiety? I ask because I'm 3 weeks in and have found since the beginning that the greatest benefit of keto is feeling full all the time. Regardless of ketosis and regardless of occasional cheating, it seems to me that the nature of the diet causing lower calorie intake is where the magic lies?"
keto,Alternative to all purpose flour for breading without using eggs as a binder?,"Hi, my dad uses all purpose flour to act as breading for fish before cooking it in oil to prevent the oil from splattering on to him. I see people recommending whey protein isolate and pork rinds, would they be a good alternative? My dad doesn't dip the fish in egg to save time so I don't know if it would stick to the meat really. Also how good would ground flax meal be? Would like to use it as its higher in omega 3s and lower in saturated fats.


Sorry if the wording is kind of weird, I'm big noob when it comes to cooking. 


Also, I know saturated fats on keto aren't terrible, its just my dad isn't really keto, I'm trying my best to lower his carb count (he's older so its kinda tough), but he still has a somewhat moderate level of carb intake and has heart issues so I'd rather use a low saturated fat product"
keto,Reducing waist size,My waist size was 35.5 inches 2-3 months ago. Now it's 33.5 inches. I didn't exercise much (like only 60 pushups 9/10 days and 2 daily 1 minute planks on average). I think the biggest change I did was totally remove orange and carrot juices from my diet. Good and Gather Orange Juice and Bolt Carrot Juice ... used to drink them a lot. I strongly believe these were the main culprits. Just sharing: someone might benefit.
keto,Transitioning off of Keto,"Hi all! 

Don't know if there are already pre-existing threads about this, and if there are, I'm sorry about posting a new one. Would just like to ask a couple of questions!

&amp;#x200B;

I've finally reached my goal weight and it's time for me to transition off of keto onto a regular diet. Looking for some tips!

I've started my keto journey in February of 2020, weighing in at 123kg / 271lbs and as of yesterday, I've reached my goal weight of 80.4kg / 177lbs (80kg / 176lbs was the actual goal, but I want to transition to a normal diet in time for Christmas!)

Now I'm aware that it takes time for your body to adjust to a diet change, and that's exactly why I want to start transitioning to a regular diet today so I'm ready for the 25th of December! 

I've heard that you're supposed to slowly increase your carb intake, which makes sense, was wondering if there's anything more I should look out for. 

Will I get the same flu that I had when transitioning to keto and if so, is it just as bad as the keto flu? 

Also, any tips on not gaining the weight back? I've heard you gain some water weight when going back to a regular diet, which I'm totally okay with. And I don't think self control will be an issue considering I had no trouble staying away from cheat meals while I was on keto.

Is there anything weird or strange or interesting you've noticed when going back to a regular diet? 

Did carbs make you more hungry than usual?  

Are you still tracking your calories? are you still in a caloric deficit or are you trying to maintain your current weight? 

I've got so many questions, but these will do for now!

Thank you!"
keto,My last hope is keto (or maybe it was),"I've started doing keto again one week ago. During the first 5 days, I've lost 7.9 lbs and I know that might sound awesome but I approximately ate 600-800 kcal per day only. Yesterday, I had raw milk, kimchi, and ground beef. Early this morning, I went on the scale with clothes on and saw that my weight was up 3.9 lbs (pants and a t-shirt aren't that heavy). I don't get this because I was in an optimum level of ketosis **and** had a caloric deficit. No, I'm not expecting to lose 20 lbs per week and I'm okay with weight gain as long as I can logically explain why it happened. But now I just feel stuck, bored and tired because I've done so many diets and put all my hope into keto."
keto,"It's not a huge thing, but it's an important thing to me...","I started my keto journey in earnest in June at about 335 (was 350 in March, but lost without keto at first). From June to September 1 I lost 35 more pounds. I've bounced up and down (though trending lower but much slower than then), and now I'm right in the 284-286 range on the daily. 

My minor victory/brag is this:

All of my clothes fit me now. 

All of my pants are too large, but I know I can wear without busting out of.

I can wear pants without \*overheating\*

I can MOVE again.

I'm so cool now, I stopped shaving my head and I have hair again-all because I'm \~65 pounds lighter and not sweaty all the time!

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the reason I came here, though: I bought my first XXL shirt that fits without pretending it fits in a decade. It just fits. It fucking fits. No stretching, no uncomfortable tweaking with it. Just put the fucker on and wear it!

Hallelujah. Where's the tylenol?

Happy holidays y'all. Keep up the hard work and don't slip too much this season."
keto,Is there a way to find keto recipes that arent specifically keto but just naturally keto? Sorry if this is confusing,"Basically when i look for keto recipes i usually get results like ""how to make keto bread"" or ""make this califlour rice"" i dont really want subsitutes i just want ideas for food that has low carbs. Like a salad is low carbs if you do it right but i never see that pop up when i look up ""keto recipes"" its mostly just how to turn something keto thats not. Or like plain old steak is keto but i dont see that when i look because its not really a recipe it's just a food item. Im not sure if what im asking makes sense but basically i just need help thinking of good keto ideas that even people not on keto would make and not even realize its specifically keto."
keto,Finished 3rd Week,Finished my 3rd week of keto. Averaging about 1700 calories a day and 10 g of carbs or less. SW 203.8 CW 203.4. A whopping .4 lbs in three weeks.   I track everything I eat with MyFitnessPal. My morning glucose reading is 117. Not very happy at this point. I’ll keep going but it’s pretty frustrating.
keto,Calories vs Fat Intake,"Hi friends, I am a new keto crusader eager to get healthy (and lose fat weight). I am not sure if this has been covered already but am really struggling to understand why its OK to not hit all my fat. I understand that I need to hit protein (to keep muscle) and carbs (for making the ketone shift). But if this is a high fat diet, why is it OK to not finish eating your fat. Btw, I am actually 100% of not finishing your fat (its disgusting to consume just olive oil or butter or ghee) and in a way not finishing your fat also leaves below your target calorie (which is good for weight loss?). Thank you in advance for helping out a beginner!"
keto,Digestion issues,"Hello everyone. I’ve been a longtime lurker and have found success with the Keto diet a couple of years ago. Since then I have developed an incisional hernia that has given me trouble with digesting certain foods that contribute to partial obstruction issues. I was wondering if anybody else has similar issues and how you go about helping your body digest the food you eat better? 

My trigger foods are cruciferous vegetables, red meat (ground beef seems to be okay in small portions), olives, nuts and onions. I try to stay away from raw anything these days. 

I’m struggling and I’m the heaviest I’ve been in a very long time with Keto being the only way of eating that has truly worked for me. I’ve tried and failed 6 times over the past 2 years with each time almost lending me in the hospital with obstruction issues."

keto,Sad about stop in weight loss,"Hi guys, this marks my second week with no weight loss on keto. I know it's not long enough to be a stall but I'm struggling with motivation after this stop.

I've been on keto for 14 weeks now. I'm F/26/5' 4""/145lbs. My starting weight was 166 and I want to reach my goal weight of 120lbs. I don't mind the slow weight loss, I had been losing less than 2lbs until week 12.

Last week I ate really well but I think I forgot to control my cashews and they ultimately added up so I didn't lose any weight.

I'm just quite sad today because with lockdown and everything going on, the tiny loss every week was something positive to look forward to. I work hard on it every week. Maybe you can share some positive ways to deal with this because I don't want to give up. I know I just need to keep on going...but it's just hard some days."
keto,Atkins bars yes or no?,"Hi guys. I just bought some atkins brownie bars and thought they were perfect because they are 2.4 net carbs. It tasted absolutely delicious.

keto,Tall\beef dripping without cooking?,I was wondering if it's safe to consume tallow straight off the shelf. My love supermarket sell Britannia beef dripping and I wanted to put i t on pre cooked chsicken to fatten it up. Is it safe to consume beef dripping straight off the shelf?
keto,Questions for long term Keto Protocol users,"Hey everyone,

So a little bit of background, I've been practicing keto for about 2 years now  (either a relatively short time but possibly longer than general) since around November 2018 and I have been experimenting and tuning my protocol for my personal needs but 2020 feels like it has absolutely wrecked my habits (dunno if anyone else feels the same). Before going in 120% full force into Keto back in late 2018, I had implemented several strategies that helped me lower my weight in the form of: 61 day juicing fast, typical ""eat less, move more"" diet, no processed food, extended water fasting with no processed food, intermittent fasting, high fat low carb, to keto. And while in Keto, I've implemented Clean Keto (absolute best results), dirty keto, and carnivore keto (Not sure if there is too big of a difference between dirty keto and carnivore keto, at least the way that I practice it).

Through out my journey, I've lost about 140lbs from my heaviest to my lightest (Went from 305 lbs to averaging about 162lbs). This year I went up from about averaging 162lbs from January and February back up to about 170's from March to about May, and starting in June I was back in the low 180's to recently. In the last 2 weeks my weight has started to go back down to the high 170's (I found out that I have an allergy to coconut products, and as soon as I removed Coconut I stopped retaining as much water and my weight has started to go back down).

The biggest drastic change that I've had this year from Covid lock downs (I'm in the Los Angeles area in California) has been that my physical activity has drastically gone down (I work in IT and before working from home, my average daily step count was anywhere easily from 8k - 12k but now it has gone down to an average of 2k - 4k) and my water consumption went from averaging about 5 1/2 - 6 1/2L of water, down to about 4L of water.

The entire time that I have been figuring out my body, and what protocols work for me I have been practicing and implementing 100% without any health insurance or any oversight from any doctor. All of my experience has been self guided with A LOT of research being done, with guidance on what to continue to implement through the drastic changes on how my body feels. I've never really felt like I've been in any danger except for a couple (When I was figuring out the best daily quantity of water to drink without drinking too much - thank you hyponatremia)

My question to long term practitioners---

   \-Do you have a primary care physician?

   \-How did you go about finding a trustworthy primary care physician that is knowledgeable in regards to Keto to make sure that you're receiving the best care you can get?

I feel like I've been having to climb this mountain on my own blind and it's gotten to the point where I have to get the baseline taken care of because I fear that I may be potentially causing long term harm to myself (I just turned 33 on Dec. 6th). I know I definitely need to get some baseline blood work taken care of along with checking inflammatory markers. 

I have a lot of severe food allergies that I've been having to figure out through a lot of trial and error:  
  Major Allergies and issues:  
   \-Celiac Disease  
   \-Milk and any derivatives of Milk (Creams, cheese, whey, binder)  
   \-All Berries (Severe enough to react to the touch, I found out black pepper is part of this...)   
   \-All Treenuts    
   \- Coconut (Recently found out)  
  Minor Allergies  
   \-Sweet Potato, Peanuts, Honey, Pineapple, Honeydew, Cantaloupe, Thyme, Dates, Peaches

Sorry for the long post, but any information regarding finding a good doctor would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you everyone!"
keto,Interesting blog article about measuring ketones,"I really like this article because it is written in an accessible no-nonsense but still technically precise way.

I'd be interested in what you think about it, as I have not done any research on it myself.

keto,2 Feel Goods,"Two things happened to me this week that were huge things to me, but I just didn't know where or how to share it.  They may not be much to some - but like I said - they were huge to me.

1.  I had a specialist Doctor visit because of some hearing loss.  The female ENT doctor said to me ""you look like you are in great shape.""  I'm 6'0 on a good day and weighed 265 and was not happy with my image.  Since being on keto for \~6 months I'm down to 213 - still disgusted with my gut. But look much better in the face gains department.  I think thats the first time someone has ever said that to me which is why it was huge to me.
2. I've been wearing size 40 or 42 pants for as long as I can remember.  My pants are not working anymore no matter how much I cinch the belt down.  My belt!  My belt is down to the last hole.  Anyway, we went to Kohls to buy jeans.  With COVID and all they have decided to close the dressing rooms.  My wife wouldn't let me try them on near the rack so I picked up a size 36.. being optimistic.  My wife argued with me and convinced me to grab a size 34...  I laughed but got them.  Got home and the size 34 fit.  WHAT IN THE WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS?!  How am I in a  size 34 pair of jeans......................

Anyway.  They were huge feel good moments.  This thing works.  You just have to make a choice.   Am I in this or not?"
keto,Fed up!,"At the tail end of 2019, I was depressed, jobless and the biggest I’ve ever been in my life (365lb, a pound for everyday of the year). I told myself i was ready for the massive change of losing 100lbs. I am a 5’11 woman &amp; my only goal is to see 250, and if I see fit, keep going from there.

Back in June of this year, I got down to 293. That was a 72lb loss in 6 months. I was running a 13 min mile and was so proud of what I looked like. With 43-ish more pounds to go, I was extremely excited that 2020 would be the year I “figured out” my weight problem.

Then August hit. And I found myself in a real defeatist depression. I ate french fries for every other meal. Bread whenever i saw it around the house &amp; stopped running.

I saw the scale was 308 in early September... and thought “if I stay here, I can turn it around when I’m ready.” But that soon became 315, then 325, and then 336... and lastly 340 at the tail end of November.

And there I was the first week of December, angry at myself for basically letting my depression dig me so deep that I didn’t care about something I’ve wanted since I was 10.

I’ve restarted my keto journey 2 weeks ago, and have gone from 340 to 328. At 328, I stall &amp; go back to 330lb. At this weight, I know this can’t be right to stall so early.

Typical day: HIIT workout or run for 30-35 min. 
No breakfast. lunch around 1PM, typically rotisserie chicken with avocado, salsa &amp; sour cream. A gallon of water a day. Dependent on if I’m hungry or not, I’ll make some bacon and baby bel cheese as a dinner/snack.

I think I may be eating too much protein? But all my carbs are vegetables (Broccoli, brussels sprouts, spinach, cucumbers… I like salad a lot).

I also do go for a keto dessert once in a while (theres a bakery here that makes them).

At this point I feel like I’m rambling, but I would appreciate some advice. I did it before... and I know I’m capable of doing it again... but this time it feels impossible. 

I’m just happy I’m not starting off completely at square one."
keto,I weighed 235 pounds in July of 2020. Today I weigh 177 and... IM PREGNANT! (struggle with fertility),"I haven't been this light in years. Or this healthy! My body must know because im pregnant. Im going to switch to low carb because of doctor recommendation and I dont crave sugar anymore so I'll keep with what I have. Even while pregnant im still losing about 2lbs a week which my doctor said is fine the first trimester.

keto,Celebration post,"A day that years ago I’d never thought I’d see. Morning weigh-in today: 160lbs. SW (12/26/2016):  260lbs. That’s 100lbs ⬇️!!! Year 1 of keto I dropped 80 or so lbs. years 2-3 were a maintenance phase and some breaks away from keto but I should stayed strict tbh. When lockdown started in March I put on 10lbs then decided May 1 to get back on keto. 

Walked 1-2 hours a day from May-sept 1. Started working out at the gym again 5-6 days a week. I’m extremely happy with my success and I know this isn’t the end of it. Right now looking to recomp a bit. LBM is low at 125-130lbs so looking to beef that up following r/ketogains protocol. 

Hope you have a great Friday!"
keto,Sparking water has helped me a lot during keto,"I’ve been on and off keto this year, right now jumping back into it (a week in so far) and one thing that has helped me significantly with curbing sugar or snack cravings is Sparkling water. I often get flavored ones like strawberry, white grape, just recently tried orange and cream (which tasted just like the ice cream and was amazing) and best part Is it’s keto friendly 

I definitely would recommend trying it for anyone who has trouble with cravings. My brother bought macadamia cookies yesterday and they’re one of my favorites, I was tempted to have at least one but I just grabbed my sparkling water instead and haven’t thought of the cookies since"
keto,What do you guys usually top your salads with? dressing/sauce wise,"I just recently discovered my love for raw spinach so I've been having a rather Big bowl of Spinach salad daily for the past 2 weeks to go along with my meal. I love it because its high volume lower calorie/carb. 

Like the ranch dressing im using has more calories than my actual salad. Believe me i don't mind a fatty high calorie salad but for my spinach ones i really am looking for some lower calorie dressing and was curious to know what people here use for any of their salads

Been watching a lot of fitness youtubers and greg doucette has me hooked on spinach salads lol. But the sauces he puts in his makes me wanna gag sometimes.

Does anyone have any tried and tested recipes for things that would be good for presents? 

Maybe like some keto cheesy biscuits or something chocolatey with cocoa instead of chocolate? 

I only have almond flour as a substitute at the moment. I'm nipping to shops tomorrow so I can possibly grab other ingredients then.

keto,[SUCCESS STORY) I've lost 210 pounds on keto (280 in total),"http://imgur.com/gallery/9NyoMR8

I've been on keto for about a year and a few months and I honestly can't find words to describe the pure joy from loosing this much weight.

3 years ago I finished culinary school during it, I stress ate took horrible care of myself and delt with a whole load of self deprivation. I always held my weight well and it never really hindered me until one day I could barely cook anymore.

That day was the day my scale hit 490 pounds (it was a dam good scale) I would get winded getting out of chairs, avoid stairs like the plague and had to lean every chance I got. As you could imagine working with food is a very fast paced environment and I noticed I lagged behind my class mates not because of lack of skill or effort but physically.

I graduated the next month and when that photo was taken was the day I started being healthier. I lost about 70 pounds from just cutting calories (down from 4000) and being active.

Cut to about a 14 months ago and I discover this diet called keto and decided to give it a go. It was the single best desicion I ever made.

I'm down to 215 pounds for the first time since I was maby 10 ( im 24) and I have all of you to thank for the motivation and information.

So from a guy who just wants to cook thank you for saving my life."
keto,Ketosis struggles,"I have been practicing an iifym diet for 6 months but did about a month of very clean keto beforehand and was in fairly deep ketosis.  I’ve been dropping carbs to 50g a day for about 2 weeks and have converted to full clean keto 3 days ago.  I don’t feel I’m in ketosis but am eating mostly Whole Foods (with the exception of a stevia sweetened whey isolate shake post-WO) and increasing healthy fats.  

Any tips? Should I fast for 18 hours?  Should I try fat fasting?  Fat loading?

keto,Does anyone else get puffy face syndrome when not on Keto?,"I have been on and off with keto for a year, because i keep failing after a couple months. I've tried counting my macros, I've tried slowcarb. But I noticed in pictures my face was always at its thinnest while on Keto. My neck and chin and cheeks get bloated and puffy when not on keto. 

Does anyone know why this is or perhaps have a similar experience?"
keto,Gastritis on keto?,"Has anyone here developed gastritis (or reflux?) on keto?
For me it started about six weeks ago. Not related to NSAID and I had cut down even my occasional alcohol because i would get dizzy with even a sip of wine.

Started with some dizziness, then strange heart symptoms (pounding and fast rate) that would wake me up some nights. Now it happens almost every night.

The heartburn/acid pain came last. Radiating to my back and sometimes in my chest. Antacids and famotidine have helped.

I was also h pylori positive (but on blood test which could mean not a current infection) and I did the two weeks of antibiotics but three weeks later I still have pretty bad heartburn - I’m starting to think it wasn’t related to h pylori. My heart rate also continues to be elevated and pounds at night, and my cardio has plummeted. I played tennis once and my heart rate remained elevated to 90 bpm for four days. 

Since keto is high fat and fat is supposedly a heartburn trigger I’ve been eating lean meats (sliced ham/turkey), sliced cheese, eggs, and salmon. I haven’t had a burger since this started,  though ground beef/burgers was one of my staples prior to this.

(And I’ve seen doctors but nobody has a good explanation for what is causing this and why the elevated heart rate)

I thought being keto I’d be immune to this kind of thing but I guess not. I appreciate anybody that has any experience of anything similar."
keto,How do you handle people pressuring you to eat carbs?,"
Backstory: I’m Indian and like 99% of our food is carbs (dal, roti, rice, etc.) I had a solid streak going with eating Leto but recently visited my GF’s parents. The pressure to consume is so intense! My GF’s mother started thinking I didn’t like her and stuff because I didn’t eat the food she prepped (all carbs). To top it off, explaining what keto is to them is like pulling teeth! Have you experienced anything similar? If so, how’d you handle it?"

keto,Please help me make sense of my blood panel: cholesterol &amp; GFR,"Hey, everyone! I recently received the results of my bloodwork and have a few questions. I've been roughly LCHF for the last year and a half. Not die-hard keto, but I have significantly cut back on my carbohydrates. 

A typical day of eating for me looks like:

Breakfast - eggs; sausage; protein shakes with avocados, blueberries, and heavy cream; etc.  I often skip breakfast but have been more regular with my meals because of my weight training.

Lunch - I generally skip lunch.

Dinner - meat; vegetables; maybe the occasional sweet potato; etc.

I exercise three to four times a week, mostly by lifting weights and walking at an incline. I’m 6 feet 6 inches tall and 222 pounds. (I occasionally consume one of those caffeinated pre-workout drinks.)

I supplement with Vitamin C (3 g), D3 (5,000 IU), Magnesium Citrate (\~ 1 g), Zinc (30 mg w/ copper), and Creatine (usually 5 g daily, but I have recently been taking 10 g daily). I also consume 3 to 6 cloves of garlic, daily. I usually supplement with fish oil (4g daily) but have not had any for about a month.

These are my cholesterol numbers from the last several years:

1. 2013 - Total 186; LDL 130; HDL 31; Triglycerides 121. 
2. 2016 (July) - Total 173; LDL 114; HDL 35; Triglycerides 119. 
3. 2016 (December) - Total 171; LDL 121; HDL 31.5; Triglycerides 89. 
4. 2017 - Total 183; LDL 128; HDL 32; Triglycerides 115. 
5. 2018 - Total 194; LDL 133; HDL 30; Triglycerides 176. – (When I took this test, I also did a particle count test and had many, small LDL particles. I don't have the exact number(s) on hand but could find them later.)
6. 2020 - Total 231; LDL 165; HDL 48; Triglycerides 77.

**I'm super, super excited about FINALLY getting my HDL above 40, and I'm pleased with the drop in my triglycerides.** However, when I spoke with a nurse over the phone, she acted like my **LDL** and **Total** numbers were problematic; she suggested a statin. Thoughts?

Also, my **GFR** was 47.6. In 2018, my GFR was 57.9. Is this something I should be concerned about? I don’t drink alcohol, use ibuprofen, etc. I’m not sure why my GFR is low.

Any help is greatly appreciated!

PS. My grandfather died from a heart attack in his 60s. My father had a heart attack in his early 40s."
keto,Weight Loss Plateau after increasing Protein intake and continuing weight lifting,"This might be a dumb question as maybe it’s because my muscles are increasing therefore my weight as well, but I’ve been on keto for about 2 months now. I didn’t do any exercise apart from Swimming for the first month to get myself accustomed to keto. My weight melted off in that first month. Sure a lot of it was probably water weight but defo some fat as well. The second month, I started weight lifting again and slowly started increasing my protein intake while reducing my fat intake (to stay in the same calorie range). However now on the 7-8th week, I haven’t seen much of a drop in weight at all.

Would you recommend that I decrease my protein intake and up my fats? I’m currently eating around 120g of protein a day and 70g of fats a day while keeping carbs below 20g for a total of about 1200 calories. I weigh approximately 67KG and an 5’5 male. Starting weight was 77KG. 

Thank you all!"
keto,How do you up your calories on keto?,"Anyone else dealing with this? So right now my calorie goal is 1200 but so many days my stomach hurts to much to eat that amount. I end up more around 1000 or less. I'm afraid I'm not getting my nutritional needs meet. I tried adding things like butter but adding fat just ends up hurting more. PLEASE LETS KEEP THINGS CIVIL. I don't want the mods to lock and remove my post again.

Awhile back I really messed up and was doing a low amount of calories a day (300-900) on top of full multi day fasts. I dunno whats going on inside but since trying to raise the amount of calories it hurts real bad. Especially since keto is really filling. I do plan to see a dietician eventually but getting an appointment is going to take a while, I'm in the process of getting a referral from my doctor.

EDIT: After someone noting it in the comments, I am adding details of my current foods/habbits:

Im 5ft 2 1/2in, dude, 195lbs, do intermittent fasting everyday 18:6,  moderately active

I eat primarily: Tuna / shrimp / yogurt / cheese (gouda/parmesan/sharp) / eggs / low-carb keto protein bars / premiere protein powder

I do eat meat (turkey, beef, chicken, pork) but admittedly have an disliking for it. (I dunno why I don't like the taste of meat) I try to avoid it or replace it with a small amount of bacon."
keto,Sugar and ketones both dipping during OMAD,Hi I started on a ketovore journey on oct 1 and I have settled into a OMAD regimen. I have lost 25+ lbs and I have been tracking my BG and ketones twice a day once when I wake up and once before my meal in the evening. Fasting levels are 80-88 of BG and 1-1.5 ketones. I only consume water coffee and herbal tea during the day. Evening BG levels are 65-70 mg/dl and ketones are at 0.5-0.8. I’m just confused by the lower ketone numbers as I read that they should go up. It’s more of a confusion than frustration for me. Is it time for another long fast? Any insights or advice into the biology are helpful.

keto,From 183 to 120 LBS 5 foot 5 Male - Strict Keto (March to December),"Hi All! I wanted to share my results from being on strict keto since March. I've had a couple of attempts at keto in the past, but never like I have now. Even after I have reached my goal weight I am sticking to keto and making sure to count calories at maintenance. My main goal through all this was to finally get a 6 pack, and this week I finally got there! Progress ptc Keto https://imgur.com/gallery/jdBLwYQ"
keto,One full year on Keto [Success Story],"A few years ago I got diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes and was told a lot of things by a lot of people. Doctors, friends, family, people I worked with. There is a lot of information out there and a terrifying amount of it is in conflict with itself.

But I had to find something that could help. 

My blood glucose was a mess. I was swinging up and down and felt horrible and unsteady. I remember one night I went out and had a small amount of Sushi and then spent the next ten hours trying to control the madness of blood sugar spiking after the fact. And it was around then that I realized I had finally reached my limit. I'd had enough.

Against what many will preach to T1 diabetics, or really diabetics in general (t2, t1.5) I went Keto. And for my own sake, I have stayed Keto. My blood glucose levels since then have been steadier than I ever imagined, and while sometimes I still mess up and get a random spike, my body does not feel sick all the time. With a 5.1 A1c I actually had a moment with my doctor where they visibly and audibly stopped short, mid-lecture on why I need to eat more carbohydrates, and then nodded before telling me to keep doing what I'm doing. That as long as my blood tests keep coming back normal, they were not going to rock the boat.

So anyways, in my opinion: Keto is great. It took a lot of tinkering with it before I found my stride, but just sticking with the bare-minimum basics of cheap cuts of fatty beef, bags upon bags of broccoli, and small amounts of peanutbutter, has taken me far. Cutting down to no more than two meals a day within an 8 hour window, and I've found weight-loss and exercise to be more manageable too.

I know at this point I'm ranting a bit, but I'd just like to say I've lost weight, gained muscle, and overall feel much much much healthier than I did prior to starting this, and I encourage people to try it themselves. While non-diabetic people might be able to handle the accepted levels of carbohydrates in the average diet, I strongly feel that continuing down that path as a T1 would probably have killed me, eventually. I feel that dosing larger quantities of insulin to try and control the serious spike that comes with large amounts of carbs is just too much on the body, and with the very real chance of error, it was not healthy for me.

Below I've included some observations that might be helpful for people. I am a fun control group for Keto because I make 0 insulin, so when my blood sugar spikes it's a pretty good correlation for what might knock a normal person out of Ketosis. Just note, these observations are purely subjective to me. I am just a singular person who wears imbedded tech in his arm to monitor blood sugar 24/7, and not a large scale study or anything.

----

**Meat:**

Beef - Slow but steady rise of bg (blood glucose), lasts a few hours. Nothing major.

Chicken/Turkey - Slow, yet larger rise of bg than beef. Nothing major, but consistently larger increases than beef. Not sure why.
Wondering if it has to do with what the birds eat.

Bacon - Basically like beef, but sometimes see the increase of bg continue for longer periods of time. Since it is so high in salt I don't tend to eat a lot of bacon.

Pork - About the same as beef.

Fish - does not have much of an impact. Possibly less than beef, but fish tends to be more expensive near me so I almost never buy any.

**Veggies**

Broccoli/Cauliflower/Celery are the safest. Tomatoes can be trusted in small amounts, but NOT more than 3-4 cherry tomatoes. Then things get wonky.

Brussel Sprouts are also relatively trustworthy, but they seem to spike worse than broccoli for me.

Onions/garlic/green peppers/carrots - only safe in small amounts. Large increase in bg.

Lettuce is honestly pretty bad depending on the kind. Would recommend spring mix, seems to impact bg less.

**Other things**

Nuts of any kind are safe, but only in small amounts. Larger amounts absolutely spike bg. There's def a misconception that this isn't the case. Same for meats. People say these don't spike bg, but I can tell you with consistent data that they most certainly do if you eat too much of them. No more than one spoon of peanutbutter at a time (no matter how good it is)

Diet sodas do nothing to blood glucose, but they make you bloated and seem to make water weight stick around.

Regular soda is the worst thing you can do, short of just drinking maple syrup or something.

Honey is also bad, but less bad than maple syrup. Still would avoid.

Juice - this is an interesting one. I will drink 5-10oz of fruit juice before going for a run or doing any heavy physical activity specifically because it increases blood glucose rapidly. For normal people on keto who do not need to inject insulin, I would avoid juice, but for my own personal health and safety it is a necessary part of the tool kit.

Bread is the devil.

Rice is the super devil.

Fried foods of almost any kind like you might see as take out will destroy you. Chinese food is dangerous. Pizza is equivalently difficult. Extreme bg spikes and larger doses of insulin needed to handle those.

Whiskey/bourbon/rum/any alcohol like those seem to have almost no impact on blood glucose. But if you drink too much your blood glucose goes down. Possibly to a dangerous degree in my case. Moderation suggested.

Beer is ""ok"" if it's a light beer and only one. IPA are like drinking bread, and off the menu.

Black coffee does nothing, and is wonderful.

I lost 7 pounds in the first week! I’m doing Keto, IF, and go to the gym (mostly do cardio, and some weight lifting). 

I’m trying keto because I wouldn’t lose weight on IF alone even while eating at a deficit (Nexplanon?)

Anyways, I am very proud of my weight loss thus far! 

I do get nauseous sometimes. 
I don’t know if I should blame my birth control or if I am suffering from lack of electrolytes. 
I try very hard to get my electrolytes in. 
Any tips?"
keto,Carb Manager app can track decimals!,For anyone using Carb Manager to track their macros if you go into settings and enable decimals the app will track half carbs for you!

keto,"down 113lbs (410-297) since last April, feeling alive again",What an incredible/hard journey it has been so far. I teach so when we moved to virtual last year I decided to make the changes I needed.  I started riding a stationary bike and made goals for a certain amount of miles for the week. I had friend suggest keto and at first it was miserable but it has gotten better and better in time. Not only has keto helped me lose a bunch of weight and feel better than I have ever felt but it has also helped me retrain myself and my approach to food and health.  Finding the ability to stay strong and not cheat on the diet has allowed me to be mentally stronger in other areas. I am not done with my journey but I have no doubt I will get to my goal weight (230) and maybe beyond. Just wanted to share the success :) lurking here has helped me so much.

My metabolism went up. I have even more energy than when i was just on keto alone and quality of sleep has improved but i still only get 6 hours max in.

Anyway i hope this helps anyone in need of it."
keto,My journey,"Hi guys. Here is my story. I started out big boned and my whole family is that way. I was never obese growing up. I got chubby stages here and there throught out youth but i was always moving and doing afterschool sports. I went to college and thats when stress eating had begun. 

After college my best friend  passed away and i balloned from highschool at 80kg (175lbs) to 147 kg (325lbs) and at the age of 22 starting a new job and having the dr tell you at the medical check that you are diabetic (fasting glucose was 8 if i remember correctly) 
I was still in denial for a year while taking metformin for my blood sugar. 

I tried gym and cutting calories but i was always hungry and irritable and i yoyo'd allot. After looking up atkins i went on a self constructed diet based around atkins induction phase which i eventually found out was keto.

I love all types of protein and cutting out carbs was pretty easy and in 2 years i was back at my graduation weight 80kg and ripped. I used myfitnesspal to track my food, bodybuilding.coms app to track my weight workouts with a polar hr monitor to track cardio.

Needless to say i was a health nut and then....
I met my partner who also loves fitness but who also loves carbs. It was harder to resist and for 3 years i let things slip and slide here and there and in 3 years i gained 16kg back. My sexy clothes didnt fit anymore and my loose fitting ones were tight and my partner tried to get me to go shopping and thats when i was just getting back to the gym and diet so i told her to hold off untill i lose the weight.

This was January this year. 

Corona hit us like a shockwave and i didnt have any way to work out. Things were getting worse and worse and i ended up drinking more out of boredom and it got to the point i seriously thought i was an alcoholic. 
Id wake up some mornings and drink and 4 months of no gym , bad eating and a cruth habbit later i was 109 kg.
I was upset but from the lessons i learned along the way i knew putting myself down does nothing and positive reinforced thoughts was the way forward.
I invested in a home gym which took a few months of being tight financially but was worth every penny.
I went back on keto 2 months ago and today im back in singles land. 99kg! In 2 months im down 9 kg and i feel great. 

So for anyone who has lost the plot or gone off the keto waggon its ok. 
Love yourself and love the journey not the destination. 

99 kg doesnt mean anything other than a goal ive seen on the internet that gives me an indication im doing the right thing. Stay positive and stay happy throughout and dont stress. 

Failure is the first step to success."

I get embarrassed talking about my weight loss for fear I might put weight back on and then what would people think and say? But I’m confident that this time I can keep the weight off long term.

I’m a 185lb male, probably around 20% bodyfat, and I’ve been doing a restricted calorie keto diet with intermittent fasting, with around an hour of cardio and an hour of lifting every day. I read somewhere that I needed to eat grams of protein equal to my lean mass to maintain my muscles while I lose fat, so I began eating around 100g fat and 150g protein every day, around 1500 calories per day. I’ve maintained that for the past week and today I’ve been getting mixed signals about how I’m ruining my ketosis by not consuming enough fat per day, and how to truly be in ketosis around 75% of my calories should come from fat intake (right now its about 60%.

keto,Questions about Keto and Covid-19,"Hi all,  Congratulations on everyones’ incredible journeys! I am on a keto journey of my own, down 30 pounds in 3 months! Some basic stats: M25 6,1 current 247lbs.

But I write this post seeking some answers or just maybe polling the crowd because I have recently tested positive for the Covid-19.

Now as a preface, I have been religious about my keto diet, under 20g of carbs a day. I have a strict meal schedule and have basically been eating the same things on a calendar for the last three months. I even twice daily check my ketone levels.

So this is where my confusion starts.....

****Please note this is absolutely no medical advice and I could just be crazy.****

But, ever since I have had covid (two positive tests) my ketone levels have drastically dropped, and I have no clue why! Has anyone else experienced this with Covid? Again I am well aware of the difference between cause and correlation, this post is more out of curiosity. 

Also, to add to my confusion, my Covid-19 symptoms are extremely minor. I’m talking, I’m still remotely working daily, and my vitals haven’t changed much. My respiratory rate has also not changed very much at all for my historical averages. I have a high level of data on my body to make these remarks. 

Adding more to the mix, I live with my girlfriend, who is not on a keto diet, also C-19 positive, and her symptoms are pretty bad. 

Again, this could all be completely unrelated!!! I just wanted to see if anyone could speak to the matter! 

Cheers and stay healthy!"

keto,The Energy,"I’ve been awake for 36 hours.

Before I changed my diet, I passed out 10-11PM every day, up 8-9AM.

Since the diet change (been STRICT keto since the day after Thanksgiving), I’ve had this slow surge of energy building in me every day. 

Not manic, but just...steady. It’s getting harder to sleep. I lay in bed for 2-3 hours before I gave up last night and troopered through the night.

Sure, throughout the day, my eyes drooped and I may have nodded off in the dull moments, but now, I’m thinking about any sort of bed time, and I’m indifferent. I can feel the exhaustion behind my eyes, but I’m not *tired.* This is the second time in two weeks staying up straight through, with several nights not sleeping longer than 3-4 hours.

Caffeine: two cups of Bulletproof coffee, and two-three Coke Zeroes in a day, none after 7PM.

I’ve dropped ~15 lbs since I started. Starting at 285, and now 265-6. It’s been significant, and concerning. I expect to hit a fast plateau soon. 

I did also get diagnosed with Sleep Apnea and have a CPAP machine around the same time. Been sleeping *better,* but it doesn’t feel as consequential. Honestly, the biggest thing I’ve noticed is I’m not cold in the mornings like I used to be. Feels like overall circulation is far better now.

How do you deal with the steady surge of energy? Have you experienced this, and what did you do? Anecdotally, is it more the sleep than the diet? 

Figured I’d start here.

Appreciate any feedback."

It is CICO after all.,"If I eat 1500 calories eating a normal diet vs eating 1500 calories on Keto, I would assume weight loss would be the same. Maybe maintaining muscle would be easier as you'd usually have more protein in your Keto diet.

My take from some comments is that Keto helps with cravings (which makes sense since carbs are not that satiating and are very calorie dense). Is that it?"
keto,Help! Keto rash on the attack,"Hello all! So I was on keto for 8 weeks and then took a 2 week break and am back on it (it’s been just over a week now). In my first 8 weeks I developed a super itchy rash that was horrible, I did some research and saw that it could be caused by being in Ketosis. I took a 2 week break due to losing a loved one and the stress of it all, and the rash disappeared almost as soon as i introduced more carbs into my diet! Now that I am back on keto, the darn rash is back even though I am taking a multivitamin, probiotic and mineral supplements! What the heck, has anyone experienced this and if so is there any solution to get rid of it besides giving up keto?!"
keto,Seat-of-the-Pants Keto,"I've been reading this subreddit for a couple of months now, and have finally decided to go ahead and give keto a go. I only have a moderate amount of weight that I need to lose, but would like to improve my BMI. The big reason for doing keto, though, is that I'm type-II diabetic, and sick and tired of being sick and tired. I started cutting out carbs this morning.

When I searched around for specific foods to eat and avoid, I was surprised to find that my normal diet was already pretty close to being a keto diet; I just need to stop eating things like bread and potatoes, add coconut oil, and maybe eat more fats and not so much protein. I'm accustomed to subsisting on things like eggs, whole milk, Greek-style yogurt, berries, watermelon, cantaloupe, avocados, nuts, green veggies, MEAT, etc. but I also typically have toast (with Vegemite) at breakfast, bread at other times (like in sandwiches) and other carbohydrate-laden foods. I've been avoiding sugar for several years, but I got on a new medication that really works well on my blood sugar levels and a1c, so lately I've been indulging in the occasional bowl of ice cream and other sugary treats.

No more treats. This morning I had my usual bacon &amp; eggs, a small amount of cheddar cheese, a nice pile of asparagus sauteed in butter, a small glass of whole milk, COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE, and skipped my customary Vegemite toast. I ate the last of the bread yesterday, and didn't buy more when I ordered groceries.

I just had a light lunch consisting of homemade plain Greek-style yogurt with a handful of blackberries and another of strawberries, a hard-boiled egg, and a large avocado. I stirred a heaping spoonful of coconut oil into the yogurt.

Tonight I'll have either pork chops or salmon as an entree, probably some onion and tomato, who knows what all. . . but I'll leave the carbs out.

I am a little leery of the ""keto flu"" and slightly worried about diabetic ketoacidosis, but we're doing this.

I just can't calorie count, is the thing. My personality just isn't suited to it. I'm making an effort to keep my portions reasonable, and hoping that'll be enough.

The only thing I think might be a problem -- but maybe it isn't -- is that my natural tendencies are going to lead me to eat perhaps more protein and less fat than is ideal. I love meat!"
keto,Any recommendations for big-batch freezable 1-bowl meals?,"Hi Folks! I'm looking to make about 20-30 pre-made meals in the right carb/protien/fat ratios so that I can freeze them and just not have to put the thought into daily calculations. I'd like to make 5-10 servings of 2-4 different 1-bowl meals (like a chili or a soup or similar) that I can just reheat each day. I'm not too worried about variety, as I'd much rather just know what each day's rations are over trying something new. 

I just finished my first 3 weeks of following the keto method. I started off slowly by just eliminating the carbs, but not really worrying too much about the exact ratios or calories. It's day 21, and I'm down 10 pounds already (1/6 of my goal). Now that I'm certain that I can stick to it, I'd like to up my game and start to focus more on the proper ratios and calorie limits and such. 

If you have a great go-to recipe for anything that would be good for this, please let me know. Thanks!"

keto,Keto is no joke!,"I'm not one to post things about myself but this time I thought I should because it might motivate someone to start as well.

That's all it took,  1 year and I'm no longer obese or even over weight.  I can do all the things I want to do with my kids.  My life is better in every way. 

So if you're here thinking about starting and are on the fence, do it.  It works if you stay on it."

keto,I gained instead of lost this week....,"I've been losing 3-4 pounds a week since I started keto two months ago. This is the first week I not only didn't lose, but actually gained 2 pounds.
That is 5-6 pounds different than where I had hoped to be when I stepped on the scale. 
I could understand two pounds being a normal fluctuation, but if my weight loss had continued I would have been down several pounds. 
Has this happened to you and what did you do to keep losing?
My net carbs have stayed under 20. I have done less strength training than normal so I know it isn't muscle. 
I really want to get back to my pre-sickness size by march or so and that means another 20-40 pounds."

Macros: 1700 cal, 20g carbs, 130g protein and 122g fat. 

It’s been a while since I’ve posted here, and since I’ve been on keto. I started back up last Monday and I’ve been seeing results already (of course). Been lurking on this sub since I stopped a year or more ago just to keep it in my mind for when I want to get my shit back together. Finally I got tired of the same old thing so I decided to start back up. 

Been doing well and keeping within my macros pretty easily. I’ve included those above in case I’m doing something incorrectly. Thankfully I’m pretty full even when eating 400-600 calories less than my daily limit and typically less than 10 carbs per day. 

Happy to be back on the bad wagon and hoping to keep this up and get down to my goal weight. This time I’m looking into recipes so I don’t get burnt out and can have some variety. 

Thanks for all of the support in this community. You guys are awesome!"

Well, I just had a pregnancy scare (my 3rd is only 6 months - we have no plans for a 4th)...I’m late but had a negative test and I’m thinking that just did the trick. When I *was* consistently keto, my period was the most predictable it’s ever been. I knew, to the day, when I would start and it never fluctuated. Needless to say, I don’t like these scares and don’t wanna do it each month. Started tracking my food and looking for success!"

keto,Is weakness normal?,"Hi all! First post in this community! 

I have been successful doing keto in the past. In 2016 I dropped about 80 pounds in less than a year.

Flash forward 4 years later, new relationship with some happy weight, and the pandemic of course. So, in short I decided I want to do keto again and get back to where I was. I know a lot of what to expect from doing it before. I'm about 3 days into strict keto.

I have a Peloton and I try to ride a few times a week. Sure, some rides are really tough, but I can usually push my way through. However, this morning (my first ride since recommiting to keto) I felt EXTREMELY weak, and after 15 min I had to back out of the ride I was in to basically struggle through a cooldown.

I honestly don't remember this happening before. Is this normal? Will I eventually feel stronger?"
keto,How difficult is gaining muscle on keto?,"Greetings everyone! 

I'm having a really hard time deciding whether I should go keto again. I have tried keto for one month some time ago, and I know my pros and cons.

Pros: really helps my mental state and seems to improve focus and willpower; more stable energy levels

Cons: more expensive, takes longer to cook, harder to handle partying, feels harder to digest.

But I would still do it if I wanted to lose weight, 100% sure. The problem is I want to gain (muscle) weight. I'm not very good at gaining it even with carbs haha. They say keto is only to be used in 'cut' phase. Or is it a myth?

I don't feel like I have extra weight to lose (quite the opposite). Would really appreciate any advice/stories/information to help me understand and make a decision."

What would be really great is if there were cheaper frozen keto meals or just frozen foods I could pop in the microwave without having to weigh them (like i have to do with meat/veggies).

keto,If I don't do it the way I did it before I feel like it won't work.,"In June (ya long time ago) I did keto and omad.  I lost 21lbs and was super happy.  I haven't since lost weight because I haven't really tried all too hard.

When I did keto during that time I counted ALL of my calories to a T.  I followed my macros I received for my stats from a keto calculator that broke it down 70%(fat)/20%(protein)/5%(carbs) and it worked really well!

I was uneducated at the time about the keto method when I practiced it that way.  It was only until I joined the sub that people told me that it's not actually necessary to eat keto in that way as long as you stay under 20net carbs!

To me, that sounded wayyyyyyyyyy easier than doing what I was doing.  So I stopped doing that.  I stopped doing my diet seriously all together it seemed once I stopped eating my macros like that.

The no brainier seems to get back on that same train I was doing since it worked.  I stopped eating like that because I stopped eating in general.  Food didn't taste nor sound good at the end of my 21 days.

The thing is...I could of easily been at my goal weight of 140 (cw: 180).  Why does it seem so hard to motivate myself the way I was motivated when I was 201?  Apparently, I am ok with being overweight but not obese.  Once I lost my obesity I got comfortable again.

Right now, I feel a skinny me is unattainable.  I'm posting to see what gets you guys passed these points to where you finally reach your goal?  I'm unhappy with my self image but I always have trouble breaking my food addiction.  How do others break their addictions to food and hit that goal?"

I was thinking of going keto for a month (to try it out) while working out. My workouts include free weights, abs, and cardio.  But before I get started I wanted to ask a few questions...

1) Can I have cheat days? Once a week?

2) Is this a good diet if I want to build muscle/6-pack too? 

3) After losing the weight, do I gain it right back if I stop keto?

Any help is appreciated. Thank you :)"

keto,Jealous Best Friend?!?,"Hey everyone! 
So I have a rant/question 

Does this sound like jealously? 

Look we all can admit everyone can fall off keto but that’s NORMAL and LIFE. I love ketosis and absolutely love what it has done for my life. To the point I say it’s for medical reasons. 

My anxiety, depression and PTSD seems
 to be way better when I am on keto. Actually my mental fog is gone to the point I can deal with my issues! I also have a small food/sugar addiction which is controlled with keto. I love feeling full and eating in a smaller window too. Although I give my body a break and don’t think it’s restricting because I choose happily to just substitute everything. It’s a hobby to lose and maintain weight. 

I lost almost 60lbs. I am 5’1, 20 year female. 118lbs my goal is 115lbs but by the time I am 24 I want to be 100lbs only because I want to have children and take a break due to pregnancies. My BMI says it’s fine. I also am not going to bash myself if it never happens. 

Anyways my best friend hadn’t seen me in awhile. She’s a bit over weight. Almost 200lbs. She’s also gained weight but works out constantly, but admits her diet is crappy. 

I was severely criticized and even told “drinking bang (I have a caffeine addiction.) is not sustainable. My weight loss was too fast and just a crash diet.” And “How I eat like a bird and never eat” 

I almost laughed and was wide eyed. 

I was just shocked and I think I surprised her how confident I was. 
I looked to my husband (who lost just as much as I did and religiously fallows keto strictly.) 
I asked him “How much do I eat honey? Tell me honestly” 
His reply “Oh my gosh don’t get me started. You eat more than I do and raid the fridge. You need to eat less.” 
He’s serious. I can eat just as much as a regular man. Not starving at all. 

I beat around the bush saying I agreed it wasn’t sustainable but how I am doing it is super comfortable. I am happy eating this way and also don’t care to cheat once in awhile. Which I did. For her birthday. They had bbq (that had sugar) pork. I ate it like a kid who never gets ice cream. I also had coleslaw. It tasted like sugar. So when they had cheese cake offered of course I said “no thanks” I thought the freaking pork tested better than my own desserts. Anyways no shame to enjoy the holidays. 

It’s not because of weight loss anymore but mental health for me. Guys I almost committed suicide once (not on keto) and have been seriously abused and the one thing that gives me control is saying “no sugar or carbs.” 

Like I said I lost a ton of weight, I don’t even fit in clothes I have and super comfortable with myself. I have done this for almost a year now. Probably won’t stop. I get it’s not for everyone. But she came off super challenging and defensive. 

I signed up for this not her. I signed up to not really eat carbs again and if I fall off, I face the consequences. My aunt until she had an injury and could not cook for herself but before that she lived in keto over four years happily. Although she did it the way I did it not shaming or stressing over an occasional life event.

 I don’t care what size my best friend is, I love her but this is for my safety and life. But I wish I could say “please this is what makes me stable and happy. I love my size now and my confidence is up which is what I need now after recovering from a serious rape during the time I was over weight and gained more because of it.” 

Sorry for the rant guys. I didn’t get into the entire conversation I just felt shamed."
keto,Wondering if Keto is for me?,"I'm not overweight and I'm not looking to lose weight, instead I'm looking to lose excess fat and gain muscle/get fit and toned (which typically muscle weighs more than fat). 
I was wondering if anyone has a similar experience and what they recommend? Is Keto a good way to go for a diet while working out?
I'm looking for a good diet and workout routine.

I'm 5 foot 2 inches tall, 25 years old, and weigh 117 lbs. 

Thank you for any and all feedback!"
keto,Help me! Keto problems.,I am a 35-year-old female. I am 5’11” tall and I weigh 209 pounds. My goal weight is 175. I started working out 3 to 5 days out of the week about 2 1/2 months ago. I am also dieting with keto. I am doing all the research I am making the correct meals I am doing my proportions. I try to stay between 60 and 70% fat. The rest mostly protein but some carbs. I have not lost any weight. And I mean I have not lost a single pound. I am very frustrated and I have no idea what to do. I physically feel better from working out and things are changing obviously but no weight is being lost. I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong. I would sincerely appreciate it if anybody has any advice or thoughts on why I’m having so many problems. Thank you in advance.
keto,How much is too much and keeping the weight off,About to wrap up my 5 weeks on keto and am really pleased with the results. 20lbs down! I’m a little concerned if this is too much weight loss and curious what are the best ways to keep the weight from coming back quickly.
keto,Anyone have problems from a blood sugar perspective with Mission Low Carb tortillas?,"Trying to pinpoint why my weight loss has stalled, and that's really the only change. Most breakfasts, I have a couple pieces of bacon, then fry one of those tortillas in the leftover bacon grease, add some melted cheese. (And depending on the morning, add some eggs, avocado and/or raspberries w cream). It's the only highish carb but lowish net carb thing I eat, and I haven't been noticeably triggered when it comes to sweet foods or going off keto. The rest of the day is meat/cheese and low carb veggies.  


My calories are higher though, I'm a lot hungrier. and it's really the only add. Once a week or so I may have a bag of Quest chips, or an Atkins candy. But I won't keep them at my house/and they're rare enough I doubt they're the issue. Something is though."
keto,What can I exchange in my diet to be able to eat a cookie?,"Currently I’m allowing myself a maximum of 2 cups of coffee (1 serving of creamer in each allowed) and no more than 7% DV of carbs. Sometimes I use that on low carb chips, sometimes a serving of frozen prepackaged meal.

How much of that would I have to sacrifice to eat a chunky chocolate chip cookie?

I’m thinking I would have to sacrifice my coffee for it, but since the cookies were a gift, I really don’t know. Is there some kind of metric for this?"
keto,"How to determine ideal calorie intake with fasting, keto, and working out combined?","Hi all, I am new to keto and working out in general but I am embracing it and highly motivated. I have always been a large human but always moderately active for my size, with my job being physical and just hiking and outdoor stuff in general, just not any actual workouts or anything. But I'm changing that. 

I was recommended MyFitnessPal to help track meals and my workouts.

I am only confused on figuring out how many calories I should be intaking daily to maximize my efforts and time. I did a few online calculators that estimated anywhere from 2000-3000 calories a day for me, my goal is to lose fat weight and gain muscle at the same time ideally.

Any insight on how I should try to figure a good number out would be appreciated!"
keto,Need help with fatbombs.,"I followed keto for 4 months at the end of 2018 and lost 20 kgs. Maintained it for a year. But then Covid happened, I became home bound, was jobless and in tight money, let depression run over me and gorged on carbs against my best judgement and I'm back to where I was.

Anyway, I wanna start again but can't seem to do so. The biggest challenge I'm facing right now is maintaining fat content. Help me with suggestions about how I can keep my fat content up. 

Please keep in mind that-
1. I can't eat pork, so pork fat is not an option for me.
2. Money is still tight, so budget friendly options only.
3. I work at least 12 hours a day, so not too much time to prepare food."

keto,WHAT IS THE KETO DIET?," 

The Keto Diet (Ketogenic Diet) is a high fat, low carbohydrate with immense health benefits. You like myself may think, ok well I need to get rid of fat so why a high fat diet?. Coconut, avocado, fatty fish are some examples of fatty foods, which promotes cell growth and the absorption of nutrients. As a result studies have shown that the overall of the Keto Diet helps in health improvement and weight loss, (get this results here, [Ketogenic Diet for Obesity: Friend or Foe?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945587/)).

**WHAT IS USED IN THE KETO DIET PLAN?**

Upon my examination and use of the Keto Diet is that most of the foods used were easily available to me since I am from the tropics and can grow my garden year round. My produce were most potent cause I grow soley organic.

COCONUTS

This one in my opinion is one of wonder when it comes to health benefits. I truly prefer this wonder food raw fleshy, crunchy, sweet and very filling. Coconut/oil is also used in cooking and making salads and shakes, used as a hair moisturizer and skin oil. Coconut/oil is one of the high fat foods which are high in antioxidants, help reducing some risk factors in heart disease and lowering blood sugar just to name a few. {more info [5 Health and Nutrition Benefits of Coconut](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/coconut-nutrition#TOC_TITLE_HDR_9)}

Avocadoes tropical usually bears twice a year, with health benefits

* Folate
* Magnesium
* Potassium
* Riboflavin (Vitamin B2)
* Niacin (Vitamin B3)
* Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5)
* Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)
* Vitamin C
* Vitamin E
* Vitamin K \[info of avocadoes benefits taken from [A Non-Profit Hospital in Los Angeles](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/)\]

&amp;#x200B;

Seafood and shellfish are accepted in the Keto Diet plan, tuna and salmon are examples of carbohydrate free foods high in potassium, selenium and vitamin B. (For an in depth search go to healthline.com).

CHEESE

These cheese are perfect for the Keto Diet, they are low in carbohydrates and high in fat, they are as follows. mozzarella, string cheese, swiss, provalone, pepper jack, goat cheese, feta, just to name a few.

MEAT AND POULTRY

With the Keto Diet these are considered staple foods with provide a rich source of protein, which help to retain muscle during weight loss, they are low carbohydrate and are also an important source of minerals and vitamin B.

EGGS

*Eggs* are a very good source of inexpensive, high-quality protein. More than half the protein of an *egg* is found in the *egg* white, which also includes vitamin B2 and lower amounts of fat than the yolk. *Eggs* are rich sources of selenium, vitamin D, B6, B12 and minerals such as zinc, iron and copper. [www.bbcgoodfood.com](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/ingredient-focus-eggs).

CHOCOLATE

Ahhhhhh sweet chocolate, which is a delicious source of antioxidants. These are tropically grown.

I get these raw, my kids and I enjoy sucking the seeds and then put them to dry, then I would roast, pound them with my local spices till they are sweaty and roll them in a stick, then my local chocolate tea is made. I cannot begin to tell you how beautiful this drink is.

NOODLES

SHIRATAKI

made from the plant Konjac a.k.a. glucomannan.

COFFEE AND TEA \[no sugar\].

To increase your metabolism \[caffeine\].

OILS

Olive and Coconut Oil.

Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, helps with weight loss, reducing the risk of diabetes, cancer are among the health benefits of using these oils.

NUTS AND SEEDS

A great source of fiber, these can be a fun snack time.

BERRIES

These are low in carbohydrates and high in fibre. Healthy snack time.

YOGURT

Can be used to put more flavour in your fruit and nut collection, very paletable. Great source of probiotics which is a healthy bacteria in promoting health immune system and great digestion.

IN CLOSING.. my experience with the Keto Diet is one of excitement and education, the knowledge you will acquire will be astonishing, learning and exploring the different simple ways to prepare those lavish and attractive meals.

keto,Need some advice- seem to lose appetite for most meats in last 3 weeks,"Background is i started over 500 lbs and got to 425 in a year. Stayed the same for about a year going through major life problems. Started going to a doctor again in July and am down to 400.

In the last 3 weeks I have had almost no appetite for any lean meat such as chicken and turkey. Even some hams and other lunch meats. I have been craving peanut butter , steak, bacon and hamburger. For some context I have been on metformin and Wellbutrin since July and Adipex for 8 weeks with 4 weeks remaining. Has anyone ran into this problem or issue before. Even the smells of them seem off.

Also I have zero covid issues and I can taste and smell other food fine."
keto,Cleared my first goal weight - 16kg down!,"3 months and I've finally managed to hit my first goal post of 80.0kg! When I first started keto in September, I had gained 5kg sitting around at home for 3 months and being fed by mum...it truly hit me when I stood on the weighing machine and realised I was 4kg away from triple digits...

As a woman diagnosed with PCOS 13 years ago, weight has been the most frustrating factor in my life and no matter what I did, it would just go up and up. These past 3 months have put my weight back to what I was at age 19 (I'm 27) and I am stoked beyond belief!

Just wanted to let anyone else struggling today, especially those with PCOS complicating their weight profile, to keep carrying on! Not only has my own self-esteem leaped in bounds, but I also have other small non scale victories like not snoring in my sleep haha! I still have 20kg more to go, but at least now I know I can get there...thanks so much to the tips and the constant stream of success stories on this sub that has gotten me here!"
keto,Could not getting enough calories in on KETO be the reason behind me having anxiety/depression isssues on the diet?,"Ive attempted keto at least 20 times over the past years. Ive read all the books so Ive gone through the ""induction flu"" stuff and experimented and monitored plenty enough on the electrolyte side as well as adding other supplements such as magnesium etc.

The only thing left I just realized is that Ive never tracked my calories. 

So just curious if anyones had any cognitive/emotional issues with not eating enough calories without realizing it... as its easy to do on this diet because the satiety"
keto,Mud wtr good or not?,Hey so ive been doing some research before spending money on mudwtr i know its nothing new and saw a post on thus subreddit about mudwtr scamming people with how much they serve for portions in the 15-30 servings options. I was just wondering if that ever got resolved? Or if anyones tried it recently and hasnt found any problems with it in general? Im probably gonna buy it just covering all my bases before i possibly waste money lol
keto,Is keto really worth it?,So I started keto about a week ago and in short it has been awful so far. Keto flu set in on day 3 and up untill day 6 I didn't realize I needed higher amounts of electrolytes. So for the past 2 days I have been taking the recommended doses and I still feel like crap.  I have been getting severe nosebleeds and have been so fatigued I can barely get out of bed in the morning.  I just want to know is keto really worth it? I really don't know how much longer I can keep going like this.
keto,Do you have to be under 20grams of carbs a day for Keto?,"Hey all hope everyone is doing fine.

**Context:** *I (34 f) have hashimoto's and celiac -* *now hypothyroid i've just started levothyroxine.* 

I need to try to lose weight i gained with hashimoto's. It's a tricky balance i find, because if i go too hard with fasting, my body seems to attack itself (get run down and sore throat), yet if i don't balance eating i gain weight rapidly.

I'm currently doing IF 16/10 &amp; low-carb. It feels good. 

But i was bummed-out when my Keto friend said i *must* be under 20grams of carbs per day to lose weight. The reason i'm bummed is because - i already can't do gluten and dairy, so for me, in hot Australian summer, a soy iced latter (no sugar or sweeteners) is my luxury. I don't have sandwiches, bread, chips - none of that. So, would one soy iced latte (large) 2 to 3 times a week really break keto entirely (with fasting)?

*Thank you kindly &amp; appreciate you helping me*"
keto,Vegan-keto-friendly alternatives to yogurt.,"Hi,

My breakfast includes eggs and cream cheese - which I want to replace with some non-dairy alternative.

What I like about cream cheese is it's very fat and salty and I enjoy it. But I feel like since I've started adding dairy some of my skin conditions (psoriasis mostly) have been worsening due to that.

Any suggestions for similar tasty alternatives I can rub on my flax-seed bread?"
keto,New here! Been on keto for a month and a half and lost almost 20 pounds :),"I got diagnosed as prediabetic on oct 30 and got on keto on nov 1st, I did lazy keto in the beginning but now I’m fully trying to do keto and it’s been a good journey! It’s always tough in the beginning but luckily I’m not a sweets person so it helped a lot. What I did struggle with was carbs and over eating since I used food to help with depression. 
I started at 255 and in the almost 7 weeks since starting I’ve lost 17 pounds and still going. I think it’s a good pace for me because i do struggle with food but i do wanna pick it up more and I’m glad I found this sub to help me with staying on track. I went back to the doctor maybe by the start of dec and my sugar levels as well as cholesterol were vastly different from what I started with and I felt proud and knowing I’m going in the right direction.
I’m 5’5 starting weight was 255, end goal is honestly just getting better, reversing my prediabetic and maintaining it lmao"
keto,Holidays!!,I’m going down to my dad’s family to celebrate for Christmas! I won’t be able to go keto keto but I was wondering if one cheat day is allowed. Would it knock me back to the start? I’ve been on keto since November and have lost a stone (6kg/ 14lbs). It’s not the best but I have no clue if I should’ve lost more. So two questions! Am I losing weight at the correct amounts (should I have lost more) AND am I allowed a cheat day! Can’t wait for your inputs ❤️❤️
keto,Help! Cereal is sabotaging me,"It’s is my only true (lifelong) weakness and the only way I avoid gorging on it is by not having it in the house. But my husband loves it and it’s not ok for me to ask him to avoid it.  (I’m embarrassed but it’s just not possible for me to eat a tiny amount that would fit with my macros.) I tried &amp; liked Magic Spoon but it’s SO expensive. 
So, has anyone found a good substitute for cereal or am I doomed?"

keto,ISO simple recipes for desserts,"Anyone have any simple (no hard to find ingredients like monk fruit etc) recipes for desserts that could be easily packaged in a box or treat bag?  I’m contemplating doing some surprise boxes of goodies for some keto friends since we can’t be together for the holidays.  Things like cookies, brownies, firm cakes/cupcakes etc....you know, things that can handle a car ride in a box or bag but also won’t stress me out trying to find ingredients and make the things."
keto,Cottage cheese and Keto,"Been on Keto for a week.   This is my second try since pandemic and since we are on quarantine I figured I should give it a try.

I am going to jump back into exercising today, and my favorite after exercise snack is daisy light cottage cheese.  It has 5g of carbs per serving and I usually eat three servings.  My macros per the calculator say I should be at 28g or less.

Questions:   Anyone else eat cottage cheese on keto?  Second, is 15g at once a bad idea?  I will be staying under the the 28. 

Thanks all!"
keto,Hard time keeping protein down and fat up.,"Hi guys! I’ve tried the keto diet in the past and I drink ketones.

I’d stay within my calories and keep my carbs under 20 net grams per day and would be disappointed when it didn’t work for me. 

I’ve previously been dieting as I have gained a LOT of weight over the last 5 years and am a 5’4 female near 250 pounds 

I’m struggling with inexplicable insomnia that doctors still haven’t solved so I really don’t have energy between that and 3 small kids, working and being inside all day to do working out .. I will get there but I am good at sticking to diet and was previously losing 8 pounds a month at 1700 calories a day (no working out.. yet)

I’m giving keto another shot for a different reason this time.. to bring down my A1C.. a year ago I didn’t even know or care what an A1C was but now I am at 5.8 and was having full blown diabetic symptoms.

I quickly changed my diet and lost weight and went to do bloodwork again and my A1C hadn’t budged so I knew weight loss alone wasn’t the cure and I’d have to reset myself with keto. 

I only plan on doing keto until I’m around 5.0 A1C I guess and then slowly adding back complex carbs and making sure my A1C doesn’t rise.

I’m struggling with keto bc I do great with macros and calories and steering clear of all carbs and hidden carbs but I keep not getting enough fat and having too much protein which I know can defeat me lowering my A1C.

Anyone have any tips? Also, it’s hard for me to always cook a big meal so on top of regular tips any quick tips on what to do, keep in mind and eat when I sometimes have just minutes between my kids?"
keto,Looking for a comment about setpoints/“plateaus”,"I was sure I saved it but I can’t find it.

It was a really encouraging comment about how what seems like a discouraging pause in weight loss can be seen as a really encouraging body set point reset that should be welcomed because it means your body is settling into a homeostasis/comfort level at a lower weight, and in the long time it will make weight maintenance easier even if it’s frustrating in the short term.

Anyway that’s much where I am now. I’ve been hovering right around but over 170 for a few weeks. Trying to focus on the positives of how far I’ve come and keep calm and keto on. I was saving that comment for a time exactly like this one, and now I can’t find it 🤣

In the mean time I’m working on creating some before and during images, and so much thanks to everyone in this community."
keto,Best low carb noodles...that don't taste like plastic,"Ok, before you say it...I love spaghetti squash and will even occasionally make zoodles from fresh zucchini. But sometimes I crave a little different texture. I tried pasta zero. 🙄 The package said to rinse thoroughly to get rid of the 'earthy' taste. Ha! To me they tasted like straight plastic no matter how long I rinsed them  or soaked them in my chosen sauce. Has anyone found anything similar to pasta zero that actually tastes decent?"
keto,Organic Cage Free vs Pasture Raised,"I have a bit bigger of a budget for food now, and since I eat SO many eggs, I figure it'd be smart to get some higher quality eggs than just the 99 cents a dozen ones. Yes, I know, it's not NECESSARY, but hey, I want to invest a bit in my health.

But my grocery store doesn't have pasture raised eggs, and if I want to get the pasture raised organic eggs I'll have to go to another store and spend like $6 a dozen.

I could do that, or I could get the $3 a dozen organic, cage free eggs. They do say ""Free to roam, nest and perch in a protected barn"", but I doubt that matters.

From a health and taste standpoint, is it worth it to upgrade to organic? Or should I either just stick to cheap eggs, or go all the way to pasture raised?"
keto,Whey protein isolate vs protein powder?,"I've seen a couple of recipes recently that call for protein powder (specifically a quest unflavoured protein powder)

I don't know much about protein powders, but know my local bulk barn do an unflavoured whey protein isolate, just wondered if there was a major difference between the two or the isolate will work in the recipes?"
keto,Breasts vs. Thighs,"Hello everyone, new to the keto diet again, and had a quick question that hopefully someone can shed some light on for me. I got a keto cookbook, and most all of the chicken recipes call for using thighs or thigh meat, but when I went to the grocery store for my meals this week, I bought breasts, just out of habit. Will they substitute for the thighs, or do I need to go buy thighs now? Thanks for your input."
keto,Any people go keto after doing plant based?,"What were your experiences on plant based vs keto? How different did you feel? I love keto but I’ve recently been so disgusted at meat (just tired of it after eating so much after years of keto) and I’ve recently been ethically / morally conflicted about meat. I know vegan or vegetarian keto exists, which is what I’ve been doing the last few months, but I’ve considered going plant based for more variety as a vegetarian... but I like the way I feel on keto. So I need any advice and experiences for those that have done both. Thanks :-)"
keto,Keto without some basic foods,"Does anyone have any advice on doing keto without eggs, avocado, coconut, peaprotein,  dairy or salmon. I feel like it's almost impossible or really difficult to start as I'm intolerant to all these foods and high fat right now adds to my gut distress. Does anyone had the same issues or have any advice?"
keto,Keto take 2 begins,"“Just stop eating, it’s simple!”

“You want to live a healthy life into late adult hood, right?!”

“You’re eating habits worry me, I’m scared for you and your health...”

These are the things I’ve been dealing with and it’s really frustrating hearing it from people who don’t have a binge eating problem and think I can just turn it off whenever I want to. I know they mean well but they just don’t understand what’s it’s like to be someone who’s addicted to food— I turn to this community for some positive stories and advice as I begin my second attempt at becoming a healthier and happier person with the help of keto! I’ll share a bit of my story to put things in context:

My 20s: I put on approximately 100 lbs over the course of a decade as a result of binge eating. While I once felt ashamed to admit my weaknesses, I no longer feel that way. I was severely depressed and anxious, and had no idea where I wanted to go with my life— while I always enjoyed food growing up, it became an addiction out of the comfort it provided the empty shell of myself that I had become. Queue New Years 2020 and my first legitimate go at keto.

January 2020: starting weight was 260lbs and I was able to maintain keto for 6 straight months and drop to 200lbs— I felt great, had a lot of energy, and was proud of myself for staying the course on a goal I had set for myself.  There were still many things I struggled with but this was something that really started the momentum in the right direction

June 2020: I started seeking therapy to help figure out my life and decided to leave the career I hate and go back to school— I started finding discipline in more aspects of my life and things were great. The person I once was started coming back to me and I couldn’t be happier. This is also when I let my guard down and decided to cheat on keto.

Since the early July 2020, I’ve gained back 25 of the 60lbs I lost. So much is going right in my life and I couldn’t be more excited about that, but the food addiction crept back in slowly and eventually took off. Lately I’ve been really frustrated because several people who are important to me asked what was going on, and when I told them, they scoffed as though I was just making excuses and it was easy. I’ve decided to let that frustration go and do two things: focus on getting back on track so I can start to feel good again, and stop listening to those who don’t understand. I’ve lurked on this server for a long time and I know I’m not alone. Today I make the decision to do what’s best for myself and reach out to the community that has inspired so many to become a person who isn’t controlled by their impulses!

keto,Fiber?,"Wondering if u all eat a lot of fiber or not. I unfortunately have an anal fissure which sucks. It started way before I went on keto so I know keto didn't cause it. My colorectal doc recommended I take citrucel fiber but that eventually caused me nausea and vomiting. I am never constipated on keto and feel less bloated. However, high fiber is recommended to heal a fissure. (Softer stools).

I was getting around 7-10g fiber daily, and last week I started bumping it up over 20 which is recommended for the fissure. My #2 feels a bit softer, but now I have to go way more often, and am generally feeling bloated and like I need to do #2 almost all day. 

My fiber primarily comes from chai seeds and raspberries, along with some mixed nuts and nut butters.

What do you all do for fiber, examples of the foods you eat and grams per day would be quite helpful. Thanks!"
keto,Some tips for Detoxifying Your Body," Detoxification is the method by which your body gets rid of debasements. This is often an imperative prepare for progressing wellbeing and advancing weight loss.

keto,Managing Health Anxiety,"40y/o Male.  I have been eating LCHF and 20/4 intermittent fasting for almost 4 years.  I’ve done this in stints in the past, but this is by far the longest I have stayed on the wagon.

I lost 30lbs immediately, and I have maintained this loss within a few pounds ever since.

I eat A LOT of fat - mostly from beef, chicken, fish, butter, and fish oil supplementation.  I would estimate that more than 70% of my calories come from fat. 

All my lab results are excellent - insulin, hba1c, triglycerides, liver enzymes all very low, kidney function is high.  Trig:HDL = 0.79.  Bioavailable testosterone is of an average 30 y/o male.  Everything is in an optimal range except for....well, you know which one. 

Given the wealth of knowledge available on YouTube as to why high fat diets are safe and why LDL isn’t dangerous in the right metabolic environment, I still get nagging worries about the long term consequences.

Even today there are studies being released that claim negative effects of fat consumption on heart disease, stroke, cancer, Alzheimer’s.  I suspect many of these studies have confounding sugar consumption alongside the fat consumption, but it still promotes worry.  The overwhelming majority of doctors are still firmly in the High LDL = CAD camp.  

If you deal with the same health anxiety, what sort of internal dialogue do you have to reassure yourself?

My plan is to eat absolutely nothing but chicken breast and beef with no sauce for a month or two to drop back down to easy breezy body. 

To supliment fat I thought about frying the chicken in corn/veggie oil but this is one of the things I'm not sure about as veggies are not exactly right in my understand of this dietary style. 

I also wanted to know if it was ok to take a 1aday vitamin to get my missing nutrients line sodium and potassium.

keto,In Search of the perfect Chia Pudding Method!,"Hi All! 

I've been all over the internet and down the rabbit hole of Keto subreddits but have yet to find a solution here, hopefully someone has a suggestion! 

I have found that incorporating a serving of about 2 tbsp chia daily is the magic solution to all my digestive distress. No more pooping to little or much or anything, no discomfort at all. It is a real game changer and I feel so much better. 

I'm not much of a keto baker or smoothie person, so pudding seems like it should be the best option time and skill wise. Problem is I cannot find a really good chia pudding recipe. For the last week and half I have been experimenting with not much luck.  

I don't know if it's the ratio of liquid to seeds, I've tried between 1/2-3/4 cup unsweetened almond milk per 2 Tbsp seeds and it seems to be always to thick and chunky or watery. Never a happy medium. 

I have been whisking twice 15 minutes apart then refrigerating the mix overnight. I have to say the texture is the biggest turn off. I've tried grinding them up before soaking with the same time frame and method but that seems to create an even worse texture somehow, like gritty? I have yet to come across a recipe that suggests anything outside of this ratio of liquid to seeds or general process. I'm not sure where to go from here to change the method. 

For flavouring I've been sticking to coca powder and a little dash of sugar free hazelnut syrup for a dessert feel, the flavour is good. It's just the texture that's blech. I feel like it's just so promising and the benefits are just too good to give up on! 

&amp;#x200B;

Soooo if anyone has a successful method to improve the texture of chia pudding I would be eternally grateful! Flavour ideas a bonus!"

keto,"Fighting Diabetes, One Wing at a Time","Hi /r/keto, Scoots here.

I started my Keto journey at 586 pounds, with an a1c of about 9 and dangerously high cholesterol. Having been on keto before, I decided to try and go back on to address these mounting health concerns. I started march 24th of this year.

It has been quite an adventure, full of testing what foods and ""carb-alikes"" my body will tolerate (Joseph's Pitas and Aldi Zero Net Carb bread have been a boon), and exploring the amazing food that can be cooked using strictly traditional ketogenic foods. I have definitely ""poisoned"" myself a few times going over my carb limits, and I think I finally have my ceilings and optimal macros figured out! 

I've very much enjoyed Ketogenic eating, because it's very simple. I do not count calories, I only track my carbohydrate intake, I eat as much fat and protein as I want. My cooking skills have improved significantly! I'm now searing, braising, poaching, steaming, and slow cooking all manner of things, and learning how to develop flavor and make substantial meals without starches. 

Anyhow, I made this post to share my results so far and say thank you, from a lurker, to all you fantastic folks. Down to the results!

I lowered my A1C by almost 2 full points, from 8.7 to 6.8.

I weighed in at 453 pounds this week, for a total of 133 pounds lost. Still a long way to go, but this is good progress!

My total cholesterol was 169 as of a week ago. 

My fasting blood sugar was back into non-diabetic ranges.

Keto has probably saved my life, and for that, I am extremely grateful. Thanks y'all."
keto,"Lost 8 lbs- 5 lbs were muscle, WTF?","I’ve been on keto and training super hard for the past 3 weeks and lost 8 lbs. All my lifts have been going up despite me being at a very heavy caloric deficit. I weighed in today at the gym with my trainer and I found out I am literally the exact same body fat because most of the weight I lost was muscle. I am freaking out because I have been bodybuilding for years (prior to the current situation, where I gained a lot of sedentary weight) and that muscle was NOT easy to come by. Literally years of blood, sweat and tears.

We did inBody scans both times I’ve weighed in; first time I wasn’t on Keto, second time I was. I am probably not eating quite enough protein (this is changing TODAY) but I am eating a good amount- probably .75/lb of lbm on average- some days more, some days less. My diet is basically just meat and veggies.

Really need some guidance. I am just praying if I actually did lose this muscle that I can gain it back soon."

-There is such thing as a minimal amount of carbs to keep this ketosis state? How much is that?

-If I exceed this amount what effect I would feel and/or see once I am no longer in ketosis? I know of liquids accumulation but I might experience something else like similar to the keto flu?

Yay, all you folks have given me the tools to never be fat again!","Like so many of us when I hit GW (of 138lb) something inside allowed me to then put on weight in 6 weeks to end up heavier (as a sad 145lb).

When I was nearly hitting 200lb, so as a short arse 5'5"", that means I was virtually round like a ball, I mostly randomly chose 138lb as 'ideal'. But when I got to 138lb I was still unhappy with the handfuls of fat I could grab onto.

I think the secret to my success with maintaining below my goal weight has been to slightly lower it. Yeah, a year ago fat me thought 138lb was ideal. Having lived with that for 6 months I now know my body can easily loose another 10lb of fat, so my new GW is 128lb.

And I'm happy to take OVER A YEAR TO ACHIEVE THAT.

Recently being back into ketosis (fantastic stuff btw, mental problems cleared up!) of course I've been reading a lot about it again, since it is not the simplest of diets.

I see the phrase, 20 net carb will 100% keep you in ketosis, so I was thinking, if there are people who actually get kicked out of ketosis when they consume say 25 or 30 grams, can you share your story? Like, do you know why you are so sensitive? Does it have to do with being very thin maybe, or having extra kilos, or other lifestyle factors?

I have resistance bands and little 5lb dumbells and some kettle bells in my home, and not sure what kind of workout to do to really maximize toning and weight loss."
keto,1 year Keto Anniversary!,"I started keto this time last year. Started at 270 lbs and was basically a walking Big Mac with a large fry. 

Today I weighed in at 180 lbs. 

The best part about this weightloss journey wasn’t the weight loss, the boost in energy, or kicking the sugar addiction. 

It’s the fact that in a month I will have my first child and I’m confident I can beat her in a foot race till she’s probably in high school. 

Wherever you are in your journey right now especially with the holidays and Covid, remember the fight is hard but victory is on the horizon.

...and victory tastes sweeter than that sugary garbage."
keto,Deadly hangovers,"Hey guys. I hope everyone is healthy and safe.
Yesterday i had a few drinks after giving up alcohol the past 4 months for keto purposes and today i feel like absolute crap. Im 36 so i know that age plays a role but before this i could have 2 or 3 measures of spirits and drink enough and im fine. 

Yesterday  i was drinking water even more than usual but i wake up today and feel like ive been to a rave for 3 days straight. 

Im already leaning towards becoming teetotaller but after the way i feel this morning its a sure thing.

Anyone else go through this?"
keto,Hunger is back,"The first three months, I had a really easy time of things because my hunger levels were so low. That's changed over the last month. Still on keto, but eating far more calories. I know that I'll have to start paying more attention to macros to lose. However, is this something that fluctuates for people? Periods of hunger and periods of satiety? Or is it likely to be more unidirectional- i.e., now that my body's adjusted and gets hungry on keto, macros and calorie consciousness are forever in my future?

Was so nice not to have to fight physiological/mental cravings there for a while..."

I am struggling now, so I might take a week off then get back into it, I'm missing my morning smoothies. But its a big milestone, I haven't been under 200 lbs since high school and I'm 31 now."
keto,Questions for Type 1 diabetics on keto,"Hi y'all, I'm an overweight t1d and have been planning to start keto with my boyfriend in the new year. I have a few questions about how the diet has effected your diabetes management.

First, did you talk to your doctor before starting the diet?

How do you manage lows? Do you plan on having 0 carbs a day and covering?

Did the diet improve your insulin sensitivity and if so how much/how quickly?

Do you take a lower long acting/basal after being on keto for a while?

Has keto had any other major effects on your diabetes?"

keto,Whats your story of someone who didnt understand Keto?,"Im sure everyone here had this kinda experience, I dont eat keto often, but I was at the gf's moms house for dinner, she made us quesadillas, what was in it as far as I could discern was tortilla, cheese, chicken and some kinda black bean, it was pretty tasty

she had a jar of salsa, sour cream and some sorta home made salsa that was like diced jalopenos and garlic and oinion or something like that, all on the table

so I looked at the nutrition facts on the jar of salsa and I noticed it was 1g carbohydrates for 2 TBSP, so I remarked to my gf, ""Hey, this is keto friendly""

my gf's mom was using the stove so she wasnt looking and she said, ""what is, the quesadilla?"" and I was like, ""no the salsa""

and then she says, ""The  quesadillas are keto too""

lol, im like  ""the tortilla and the beans are high carbohydrate foods""

so my story isnt that great, but I thought maybe some of you have some real funny ones, lets hear them"

keto,Do the low carb tortillas have any affect on blood sugar?,I bought some mission carb balance tortillas at Walmart today. I read the ingredients and in theory their only 3 net carbs! But the ingredients had a lot of wheat stuff including wheat flour.... how are these low carb with wheat flour?

keto,Vomitting after a calculated dose of carbs on a special occasion,"Hey guys! I'm a month in to keto diet, recommended by my endo to try and reverse insulin resistance. Its been going ok, I'm not a huge fan of the food, and I'm generally pretty headachey and nauseated if I don't eat on time. But I've been sticking to less then 50g carbs a day
Yesterday I was at an important dinner to comemmorate a friend, and I hadn't had any carbs that day so I splurged and ordered a bowl of pasta. It was nice, but I didn't finish the last third if the bowl. The part I'm confused about is that I spent the night sick and vomitting and with painful stomach cramps.
I can't seem to find a reason why this happened? I'm not Celiac, and I've already been experiencing the symptoms of the flu for a while. I try to google reasons and nothing is really clear. The friends I went to dinner with did not get sick after eating the same thing.
Does anyone know what happened? 
TLDR; keto for one month now, ate pasta, vomitted. Anyone know why?"
keto,10 lbs down in 4 days. Is this normal?,"So I was watching what I ate up until 2 days ago starting keto. I started exercising (30 minute walk every day), and was sort of just doing what I knew I had to up until my first couple of keto days, where I actually made and tracked meals and how much water I was taking. I weighed myself. I started off at 358 lbs. As of this morning, I am down to 345. It seems so surreal. And I'm not even hungry; I just drink water and eat what I know to be keto friendly. I just want to know if this is normal and safe for someone my size?"

I’ve been clocking in at that weight for a few weeks now, and while I don’t hate keeping this lifestyle, it makes me wonder “What’s next?”. What’s the course of action from here?

keto,I don't understand....,"I'm 15 and diagnosed with pcos and my gyno said to be in a keto diet to deal with pcos. Something I just don't understand is that how people are getting healthy when some recipes have a lot of fat, sweetness, etc. I'm not trying to mean or anything but I just don't understand the concept. I tried researching and watching YouTube video and the recipes seem 'unhealthy'. I have no idea like or am I just being ignorant by thinking dieting needs to be bland or something???? I have no clue. I think that come from my mom's influence. Ive been just eating vegetables and fruits for the past month and I'm so done with that. Today I ate an apple and wanted to freaking throw it out my window bc I had it to much for the past month."
keto,It’s finally working.,"Now I’m not anywhere where I want to be. I finally see loss on a scale. I have always been extremely active, but eating out was also a joy. I never realized I let myself go, and got to 318.7 lb. I’ve been on keto for a week now, working out at home for an hour. Eating roughly 2200 calories, about 4% carbs, and the scales do not lie. I have two, just so I know they’re accurate, and they both read the same: 308.7. I’m not sure if it’s healthy to lose that much that quick, but I haven’t felt better in the longest. I’m eating great, I’m working out, and I’m feeling good. I’d love someone to keep each other in check, cause there were some times where I was close to getting in line at a Popeyes."

keto,6 month keto blood work - doubled my LDL's,"I've been on keto since early July and I've lost over 40 pounds.  It's been great.  My keto staple food is 3 eggs and 3 pieces of bacon for lunch with a half avocado.  I have backyard chickens so this works out great for me.  

However, my wife has been pushing me to go do my blood work.  So I did and just as she expected my LDL's are more than double what they were before.  I was sitting around 73 for my LDL's and now its like 158.  My HDLs actually were around 44.  (This is all from memory so they are rough numbers but close). 

I haven't asked the Doctor for a LDL breakdown but he also wasn't anti-keto.  He just said I need to try to cut back on the bacon and look for different sources of fat.  He wants me to come back in 3 months to do another work up.

I was in such a rhythm and feel like this 'go to' has been a saving grace (along with Buddy's Smoky Dry Rub wings).   What are your quick go to's?  Any one else seen the same as me after 6 months on keto and an increase in chloresterol?"
keto,Sugar addiction is the hardest battle I’ve ever fought,"I started keto/ketovore the day after Halloween, and it never occurred to me how physically addicted to sugar I am. I’ve relapsed and had plenty of sugar at least once a week since. Now when I think about getting some from the vending machine, I start to swear and get an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of my stomach. So far, I’ve made it through the last few days with having minimal sugar and I’m trying to beat the cravings and break the pattern once and for all.

But man. I just love Unwiches. I don't even do keto anymore but I am trying to lose weight, and Unwiches have been a freaking godsend.

Low-cal, low-carb lunch that is also filling? Unwich. Cheap delivery that won't make me gain 5 pounds? Unwich. Feels like a cheat meal even though it's not? Unwich. They're the bee's knees.

keto,5 month journey - Body Recomp on Keto,"I started keto one year ago and lost about 60 lbs in 7 months. I decided I needed to put on muscle and planned on doing so while maintaining ketosis. I started lifting with more intensity and regularity until my lagging weak muscle groups caught up and then the progress really started to show.

I've made serious strength gains and visibly look more proportionate and the only thing I changed in my diet was 1) increase in overall calories to at least maintenance as many days as possible
2) protein supplementation with handful of blueberries (first fruit I've had in a year, noticable difference in stamina in gym)
3) moved my net carb limit from &lt;20 to &lt;30

keto,workout help?,"looking for a little help here!

ive been doing keto about a month now, and done well. so far ive steadily lost weight without exercise. the past couple days, i incorporated running back in. i do about a half hour of running. now i am gaining weight again, but the running is all that i have changed. i gained about 2lbs in 3 days, for reference i am 5ft and 118. i have been a runner for years, but decided to cut back on it while changing over to keto, as i heard the first few weeks can be a bit rough and full of fatigue and headaches (it definitely was for me), so i am no newbie to running. is there something better i should be doing as far as exercise? 

as a note, i am a recovered/recovering anorexic, so the idea of gaining weight from exercise is really counterintuitive to me, esp since i didnt add any lifting to be gaining muscle. im mentally healthy enough to be on a diet and lose weight. im really just trying to lose a last couple pounds, thru recovery ive learnt healthier coping mechanisms. keto is the best fit for me, as my body struggles with sugar and carbs from a childhood metabolic issue."

keto,Has anyone tried TKD (Targeted Keto Diet) for long distance running?,"I’m a 38 year old male, 5’10 and 220 lbs. I’ve always been heavy but managed to drop from 285 in 2013 to around 205 by the start 2019 by some simple lifestyle changes and moderately watching what I ate. 2019 was a cluster-fuck with my son getting cancer and my marriage ending and between that and COVID stress I’ve slowly moved up to my present 220 weight. 

I exercise frequently. I have gotten into long distance running this past year (completed one marathon and training for a second) and generally run around 3 miles a day 5 days a week with one long run anywhere between 14 and 20 miles. I have not been able to stick to any sort of “just watch what I eat diet” but have been quite surprised how well I’ve managed sticking to my training program. Don’t ask me why a spreadsheet taped to the fridge has worked but it tells me when and how much to run and almost without fail I do it.

My thoughts were that maybe a stricter diet would actually be easier to follow than what I had been trying and since my girlfriend is on Keto and loves it I figured I’d give it a go. Issue is my running is still my top priority. I don’t want to scale it back in anyway but would like to give Keto a try.

I’ve researched TKD and a lot of people who seem to love it do shorter but intense weightlifting type activities whereas I’m looking at 3-4 hour runs once a week. I started this week with a carb heavy breakfast Sunday, two energy gels during a 16 mile run and have been sticking to less than 20 carbs a day since. I have an 18 miler due this weekend and was considering a fast acting carb at breakfast (honey and butter on Aldi Keto bread) as well as two or three GU energy gels during my run with the last one being 2/3 of the way meaning I will theoretically run 6 miles or a bit over an hour after consuming my last batch of non-keto carbs. After which I’d go back strict Keto for the week until my next long run the following weekend.

Has anyone made a plan like this work? I know theoretically in a month or two I could be fully fat adapted and have been told that I’d have “near endless energy” and wouldn’t need the GUs but I don’t want to give up my long runs in the interim and also want a way to incorporate a little caffeine and electrolytes mid workout (don’t want to put sugar free Gatorade into my camelpak). Any input would be welcome."

keto,"Keto, blood sugar level, insulin resistance, diabetes","Long time lurker here, thanks to this wonderful community for your inspiring posts which have helped me transition to a keto way of eating. This has lowered my A1C from 6.4 to 5.3. Several people in my extended family transitioned to diabetes at about my age (mid forties), which I feel I avoided with Keto. 

Having said that, I feel like I am still probably diabetic: keto has merely lowered my average blood sugar level because I don’t eat much carbs. But I may still be insulin resistant- which might be overcome only with 24+ hour intermittent fasting? Only then can I say that I am truly not diabetic or pre-diabetic anymore?

I appreciate if you can critique this reasoning. Thanks!"
keto,Is there a treatment for keto rash?,"(To clarify English is not my native language)
Im a 18 years old girl. I started my diet back in August and went on till mid September. I lost 10 pounds (~5kg), i went from 67 kg to 62kg. But back when i started, I noticed that I was getting a rash around my chest. With every month of dieting it got worst and even spread to my neck. After school started i stopped for 2 month (sadly I regained 10 pounds because i ate lots of sugar/carbs). Last week i was back on keto, but 2 days in and the rash was back. 
How do i treat my rash?
How do i prevent it in the first place?"
keto,Getting super tired after eating a meal,"Hello hello. I'm about 10 days into Keto and it's going surprisingly great. One issue I am experiencing is getting very sleepy after eating a meal, even if it's a meal on the lighter side, which is what they have been usually. This is not a 'fight through it for 20-30 minutes and be back to normal' post-meal level of tiredness, but one that seems to last the rest of the day, and I'm needing to nap every day, once or twice.

This could be due to a number of reasons, but I will get some stuff out of the way:

Definitely staying under 30 carbs a day (20 usually). Getting plenty of electrolytes and salt. Getting a lot of fat in my diet. Eating *a lot* of protein, which I also did before starting Keto. I'm not fasting for a long time and then eating a giant meal (no IF), I'm eating 3 smaller meals daily. 

May not even be related to the diet, but I think it probably is. Had bloodwork done recently and everything came back normal (thyroid, vitamin D, testosterone and such). It may just be a temporary phase as my body gets used to a diet it is completely not used to (I love me some carbs, so cutting back 90-95% on carbs is a big transition). 

Do any of you remember going through a similar phase in your first weeks of going Keto? Any ideas on how I might combat the after-meal mega fatigue? Maybe just stick it out until that hopefully goes away?

keto,Basic baking ingredient question about flours,"Hi all,

A quick question.

I'm trying to convert an old family recipe. It calls for 2 cups of all-purpose flour. When I read up on Coconut Flour, it says to use 1/4 cup + 1 egg for each cup of regular flour.

Is that really correct? Does it bulk up? I don't understand how that little bit of flour can make up the same bulk as the white flour. 

Thanks!

keto,Am I putting my diabetic dad (M 52) at risk by recommending him Keto?,"So my dad was talking with me and my mom about his health and how his diabetes has gotten a lot worse.  He needs insulin but he’s been really stubborn and won’t do it so he instead just takes three different medications.  This time he seems determined to make a change but we all found it hard to believe because that would mean he would need to make some drastic changes like exercising and quitting smoking (he smokes more than a pack a day).

I always told him to try out keto but he kept brushing it off to the side since he keeps saying ‘how can a Korean go without rice?’.  But after begging him to please try Keto for at least 3 months first, he decided to give it a go.

Here’s the part where I think I fucked up.  I learned that keto does help with regulating diabetes but is more effective with overweight people.  How would this work for my dad who is currently normal or maybe even underweight?  I’m 22 years old and was diagnosed with diabetes earlier this year at 280 pounds.  Because of this awesome community I was able to lose to 194 pounds and now I’ve ‘reversed’ it and my blood pressure is back to normal as well (success post to come haha).  Riding on that hype I basically preached it to my dad but now I feel like I fucked up.  Am I putting him at risk of DKA or more likely hypoglycemia by recommending this?  I’m concerned this will end up being more detrimental to his overall health if he suddenly stops carbs.  Am I overreacting?  

Thanks again!!!"
keto,Advice for doing Keto while taking antidepressants?,"Hey y’all! I was maintaining for some time at about 72kg (not goal weight) but since I was going through some stuff, focusing on maintaining seemed to make sense at that point. But I’ve now been taking anti depressants and BOY has that not helped anything. I have definitely not been as strict as I should be, so I’m now back at 80kg in a matter of 5 months which is exhausting and horrible. 

I’m getting back on the strict keto ASAP but I wanted to know if anyone else has experience with anti depressants during keto? I’m doing much better emotionally due to my meds so going off of them is not an option. 

Thanks y’all!"

keto,Papaya Salad... help!,"Hey y'all my friend recently introduced me to Papaya salad and it's amazing.

If you've never had it before it's thai dish made from green papaya (or unripe papaya), so it's not sweet.

I'm struggling to find nutritional info for Green Papaya so I can fit it into my Macros.

If y'all could help and post your sources I'd forever be grateful."
keto,How much potassium will kill you?,There not a direct answer online about this. How much potassium is to much? I'm supplementing with 2600 mg of no salt on top of my meals. Which equals to about 5000 mg of potassium a day. What is considered to much for a upper limit? Does no salt make a difference since its fits not whole foods
keto,Sudden steady Low blood glucose,Hello keto community! I have been in ketosis for 7 months. I lost about 45 lbs and absolutely love the diet. I’m desperately trying to get some guidance as very recently I’ve been noticing my blood glucose drop to the 50s when fasting and feeling a little cold and shakey. My blood glucose is in the high 60s after meals. I have been experiencing colitis and gut pains. Has anyone had this experience and could give me some direction? My doctor is no help at all😓.
keto,My story about a brush with ketoacidosis death via hemochromatosis.,"New to group but not keto. 2 years experience and quite the ride. I practice a cyclical protocol (targeted carb cycling) for my workout regiment. This photo was my first year with a strong keto and workout regiment.

I almost died 2 years ago due to something called  hemochromatosis aka iron overload. Spent 5 days in an ICU and docs couldn't figure out why my organs were failing. They ran so many tests for all sorts of infections and diseases but nothing came back positive. I was lying in the ICU dying of ketoacidosis (a1c 13.5) and my pancreas tests came back fine. Day 3 I started getting better and they couldn't figure out why since they were only pumping me with liquid bananas (iv), insulin and 1000mg potassium pills.  Day 5 I was okay and moved to holding for a few days. No more supplements, insulin or iv. I was discharged with no explanation. 

Over the last 2 years I worked on my diet and my primary care doc who does keto herself and had great success but I still was not right. My a1c dropped to normal ranges months after and has been a steady 5.3 ever since. I still felt ill and struggled for so long before the doc ran a bunch of random tests that unlocked my problem. An iron saturation and ferritin test reveled I was massively iron overloaded. This overload overwhelming my body and the reason I got better in the ICU suddenly made perfect sense. They took blood every hour for testing. This meant free flowing iron was removed from my body as well as the body started using stored iron to generate new red blood cells. Since we figured this out I get doc prescribed therapeutic blood draws and I've my diet to favor foods that contain nonheme iron vice heme iron. So my keto diet favors no red meats, rarely chicken, a lot of eggs and a ton of plants. 

For folks who will ask... No ketoacidosis is not possible by doing keto itself unless your T1 without insulin. Ketosis and ketoacidosis are very different.

keto,Electrolytes?,"What do y’all drink to get electrolytes? I don’t have a colon due to Ulcerative Colitis, and need extra electrolytes.

Do y’all drink something specific to keep up with electrolytes? Thanks!"

keto,Correct ratios for DIY electrolyte drink,"I am looking to build a DIY electrolyte drink to help me out as I am trying to stay on a healthy keto diet. I have (non-flavor) ingredients, but I'm not sure of the optimal amounts to put in. My intention is to drink this first thing in the morning as part of my waking up routine.

Here are the ingredients I have (all are powders):

1. Potassium citrate
2. Magnesium citrate
3. Calcium citrate
4. Sodium chloride (table salt)

Unfortunately there is some variation in recommended ratios of these electrolytes, and what might be needed for someone on a keto diet (I'm eating a lot of salty food already, it seems, and I don't work out much). In addition, ratios are generally given as simple parts (4 to 1, for example), but these chemicals have a citrate molecule attached to them, so the elemental Potassium, magnesium, and calcium provided are much less than the total mass. In addition, each of these elements has a different mass per atom, so doing this by weight ratios doesn't seem right.

Any chemistry students here? Or suggested ways to approach this problem?"
keto,Keto breads &amp; artificial sweeteners mess up ketosis?,"I posted a few days ago about stalling and have since read more about stalling and am trying to be patient.

The two things I've added to my diet (not daily, but a few times a week) are keto bread from Aldi (9carbs, 9 fiber = 0 net) and a sugar free syrup flavoring for my coffee made with sucralose. Has anyone noticed any negative effects from either of these items or should they be fine to consume in moderation during keto? TIA!"

I need some advice on how to stay on the diet from people who have done it, as well as the best foods for me to eat. I am in high school and I play lacrosse. Throughout the week I am pretty busy with practice that I don't have the time I wish I had to actually sit down and figure what I need to do to start the diet. I would like to start this month. Starting late January, I will be practicing every day of the week which is where this diet will get hard for me. Everything is appreciated and thank you."
keto,Question about water,"I got into a youtube spiral the other day about keto and electrolytes, when I saw some professional looking people make a case for drinking 80 oz of water, 120, 200 ...even a guy who said water is overrated and 24-32oz is fine.  He argued drinking more than 32 or 40 oz could risk peeing away valuable nutrients as waste.  

I weighed 305 on Oct 31, I am 295 today, so about 10 pounds in roughly 40 days.  I have been eating between 1500 to 2000 cal per day, and swim for an hour 6 days a week.  Other than that I am pretty sedentary. 

I drink a sugar free monster, unsw coffee + heavy whipping cream, and I stayed under 30 carbs the whole time.  

I feel like I should have lost more than 10 pounds.  My wife thought perhaps its because I only drink about 20 oz of pure WATER water, w no added stuff per day.  I had some sugar free powerades and sugar free tea, but she thinks if i were drinking 70 or more oz of water i might be having much more success. 

I would love your thoughts! Thanks to all the nice people on this sub who have been patient and gracious, you know who you are."

Thanks everyone!"
keto,5 Ways to Sneak Extra Protein Using Collagen,"Sometimes I find it challenging to meet my protein minimums so I started sneaking collagen powder into my diet. 2 scoops has about 18g of protein so it can make a big difference and it’s great for skin, bones, hair, and nails. And, of best of all, it has 0 carbs!

Collagen can taste kind of funny so it’s best to use it in food that masks the taste.

5 Ways to use collagen powder:

1. Dissolve it in bone broth. bone broth already has protein, by adding collagen you can get an extra boost. 

2. Use a scoop in morning coffee, use with care- it can upset your stomach first thing in the morning so try a smaller amount to start.

3. Put a couple extra scoops in a batch of sugar free jello- go from 1G of protein to 19G for a whole box

4. Put a scoop in any flavorful sauce, Alfredo, tomato, curry.

5. Scramble it into some eggs.

Happy Keto everyone!"

keto,"Haven’t lost any weight since September, where am I going wrong? ☹️","Hi!


So I started keto on the 8th August. Started at 223lb and have been at 205lb (I’m 24, 5”3 btw) since 23rd September. It does fluctuate a pound or 2 but not much more than that. I’m getting a little disheartened as I thought it was going so well. According to the macro calculator, at 20% deficit I should be consuming 1446 however after stalling for over a month I recalculated my macros to 25% so I’m now eating around 1338 (usually less than that). I’m always under 20g of carb, usually 15g. I eat between 60-80g of fat everyday, I used to eat around 100g but brought that down as I thought it was causing the stall. As for protein it’s tends to be between 95g-115g. I weigh everything I eat.

I’ve been doing OMAD for a couple of weeks now but still no change. Exercise wise, I didn’t exercise at all during the first month lost weight regardless, went back to work at the beginning of September and walked about 10k steps a day, got made redundant mid October so I haven’t done much walking since other than walking to the supermarket. 
I know fat loss isn’t linear and my expectations might be a lil high but I’m sick of seeing 205 on the scale. Would anyone be able to tell me where I’m going wrong please? Feels like I’m wasting my time with keto not seeing any results 😭

Any help would be appreciated!! Thanks in advance"
keto,Silly question - Why can't we drink seawater but Keto aid is fine,Don't drink the seawater or you'll get more thirsty. Yet everyone on a boat would be in keto and peeing out salt. I'm curious why seawater makes you more thirsty while keto aid does wonders for fasting and keto.
keto,Turns out I’ve been eating at maintenance - looking for encouragement to double down on my efforts,"Apparently I’m eating at maintenance - discouraged

I did keto twice when I was younger and lost easily without counting calories. I started again on Nov 1 (40 years old now) and dropped 7 pounds in the first week, then nothing. I got discouraged and decided to stop weighing myself for a few weeks. Today, I weighed in and I’m at the exact same weight I was Nov 7th. Have not lost any inches either. I am tracking and I am eating right at maintenance. Any less than that and I’m starving and obsessed with food, which I hate. Guess I just need some solidarity and maybe some tips. I don’t love cooking and I especially hate handling raw meat. 

Maybe I should be happy I lost 7 pounds in 5 weeks but I’m worried if I continue on this trajectory I’ll just maintain. I am anxious about increasing calorie counting and weighing of foods and obsessing about what I eat."
keto,Counting macros/calories,"If I watch the certain foods that I eat enough to get an approximate idea of my macros, would that be okay? (I know it’s protein, medium fat, low carb etc)

Also - what is the consensus on calorie in/ calories out?"

I lost a lot of weight and when people tell me that I look thinner I instantly have less motivation to eat fewer carbs.

And I am not eating sugar, don't worry, but I am not afraid to eat some bread slices and lasagna either.

I can post this because I just ate and that's when I regret eating any carbs.

keto,Struggles and success,"My husband and I have been eating a ketogenic diet for over two years. I struggle with my weight, as well as insulin resistance, pcos (which is related to metabolic disease), as well as some mental health issues. I’ve also been battling my demons of self worth and body image, along with bouts of anorexia and bulimia (yes, I’m a bundle of fun!)

So, this weekend, I did a fast. My plan was to go 24 hours, to kick start intermittent fasting off really well, as well as to bump insulin resistance down (Dr Berg and Dr Fung both talk about how IF, and specifically a 24 hr fast, can drastically improve insulin resistance and reset the sugar cravings). I actually made it 21 hrs, which is fantastic for me!

My husband took care of me Saturday and encouraged me the whole day. He made me ACV tea and Lemonades with cream of tartar (potassium), and I felt great. I actually went 21 hrs and proved to myself (and my stupid brain) that I can eat less or little AND I won’t die. I didn’t get the shakes or the blood drop that I’ve experienced with past fasts, specifically because I did the right things.

Today I woke up rejuvenated, and I did a work out. I haven’t broken my fast today (so 11 hrs and 30 minutes as of this writing), and I’m going until I FEEL hungry. This has been the key for me: instead of eating when bored, watching a movie, or just being near the fridge, I’m only eating when my body says “yes, it’s food I want.”

I was going to post pics, or the workout I did and my tracking on the mirror, but Reddit decided I can only post text. On November 13, I weighed 204, one of the lowest I’ve been. My trouble seems to be that I waffle between this low AND 214, one of the highest. Since November, I have weighed myself at random times, usually about a week later. I figured if I could see weekly losses (gains, really, towards my goal) that it would help so I write them in white board marker on my mirror in the bathroom.

11/25/20 204.6 Waist 41”
11/30/20 202.6  (didn’t measure waist)
12/7/20 200.2  Waist 40.25” Hip 49.25”

I’m really happy that I included hip and waist measures because while my weight may fluctuate (as a woman, this happens; working out builds muscle, heavier than fat, etc), I shouldn’t see the waist or hip fluctuate the same way.

I am hopeful for the continuance of my success and that I can keep making these good decisions to take care of me."
keto,Keto Mommas! How do you cook meals for a family who is not on keto without it interfering with your diet?,"I usually cook a protein a veggie and one carb heavy side for my family. Such as chicken, rice, and vegetables. The biggest challenge is adding enough fat for my diet without giving my family too much fat and carbs for their diets. I try to avoid cooking separate meals from them. One pot meals are challenging. And they have been complaining they want pasta meals, I've been avoiding them like the plague lol. Any suggestions? Should I just start cooking separate meals or buying some substitutes? How about the fat issue. Is an large increase of fat in a non keto diet bad?"
keto,Are there any foods or methods in your keto diet that you underestimated or overlooked that effected your progress much more than you realized?,"I recently reduced my nut consumption.

keto,Questions for those doing OMAD and Keto,"First and foremost, thanks for any and all feedback. It is greatly appreciated. Secondly, I know everyone's journey is unique and that there isn't a one size fits all solution when it comes to how we individually approach our own journey. 

That being said, I'm curious about OMAD. For those of you currently doing it, or have tried it in the past, what was it that made you gravitate towards such a short window of eating? Do you truly have one BIG meal or is more of a 1 to 2 hour window of eating, like a 22/2 intermittent fast? Did you start keto first, then because of the satiated effects of this diet decide to restrict your eating window? Or, was it that you started intermittent fasting, gradually shortened your window of alotted eating time,  and found that the keto diet was best at providing long lasting energy and satiation?

Thanks again for all responses and for taking the time to read my questions."
keto,-27.5 kg (60.6 lbs) in 3 months with some data,"I've been recording every food that I consumed since November 8, 2020, for a full month while on keto (besides 2 days of cheat meals, yeah). Now I'm about to share it, as well as my weight loss progress.

If you're here just for the data, just scroll to the ""November's data"" section.

This isn't your average post with the results. I've noticed that sometimes there are questions about what kind of food do you need to consume to lose weight, so I've decided that I'm going to record all the stuff I eat to share with you. I'm not saying that this kind of diet will be suitable for everyone (my wife tried it and dropped it after 10 days), but it's what I've done to lose weight, so maybe it will be interesting for some of you.

It's also more of a low carb or even a carnivore diet, does it still count as keto or not, I wonder? :)

# Specimen

Birthdate: October 8, 1992 (28 years old)

Gender: Male

Height: 196 cm (6""5')

Starting weight: 179.6 kg (396 lbs)

Current weight: 152.1 kg (335.3 lbs)

# Pre-COVID

Previously I had some success with almost the same diet in February-March losing 17 kg (37.5 lbs) -&gt; from 160 kg to 143 kg (352.5 lbs to 315 lbs).

During that time I was an offensive lineman, training with my local amateur football team. So I had sports for 2-3 times a week for the full 2 months. Before that period, I didn't have any sport at all. I also averaged around 10000 steps a day since I needed to go to work every weekday.

# Weight gain since COVID

COVID ruined all that for me (I'm joking, it is only my fault, of course), leaving me at home. The only activity I've done since March is going for a walk with my dog (\~4500 steps per day - 2 times less than before). Also, remote work consumed my soul (sometimes I worked for 100+ hours per week). My eating habits went back to pre-February: with lots of cheat meals (sweets, burgers, pizzas, and all the ""good stuff"" you know). That, with the lack of any sports activities, made me gain weight (plus almost 37 kg / 81.5 lbs) very fast.

I noticed that sometimes I was having shortness of breath even while casually walking. I also had lower back pain, my snoring got really loud and sometimes I felt my heart trying to pump blood - that's a bad feeling that leaves you with thoughts that you're going to die if you don't change anything.

# Episode IV: New Hope

I started doing keto again on September 2, 2020, when my weight was terrifying: 179.6 kg (396 lbs). That is the largest I've been in my life. Damn, almost FOUR hundred pounds. I still don't believe the numbers. They are too high.

Unfortunately, I have no records on what I was consuming during September and October, but I didn't really change anything during November. Except that I don't drink cola anymore (even though it was no-sugar cola), just plain water.

From September 2 to November 5 I lost 20.6 kgs (45.5 lbs). After that, I gave myself a break with 2 days of cheat meals and got back 4 kgs (\~9 lbs), but I still consider it a huge success. The thing with the occasional cheat meals actually works for me.

# November's data

I started my recordings on November 8. Today is December 8, so I have recorded a full month except for 2 cheat days (November 21-22).

Starting weight: 162.7 kg (358.7 lbs)

Current weight: 152.1 kg (335.3 lbs) - 10.6 kg (23.37 lbs) lost

I've consumed on average (per day):

* 163 g of Protein (50.6%)
* 146 g of Fat (44.5%)
* 15 g of Carbs (4.8%)
* 2119 KCal
* 3.04 l (0.8 gallons) of plain water.

Here is the chart of the foods I've consumed the most (by meal count):

[https://i.postimg.cc/gJK2wQH2/foods.png](https://i.postimg.cc/gJK2wQH2/foods.png)

As you can see, it's mostly meat and cheese. And no, I'm not suffering eating like that, it's the foods that I enjoy.

The largest source of **protein** was, surprisingly, the **cheese** (the hard cheese, to be more exact). Here's the chart: [https://i.postimg.cc/zD0fqmfd/protein.png](https://i.postimg.cc/zD0fqmfd/protein.png)

The largest source of **fat** was, unsurprisingly for me, the **beef**. It was my almost daily food that I liked to bake in the oven. Now I'm switching onto pink veal more since I like its taste better. Here's the chart: [https://i.postimg.cc/VvGsgtTy/fat.png](https://i.postimg.cc/VvGsgtTy/fat.png)

The largest source of **carbohydrates** was, unsurprisingly again, the **coffee with milk**. I can not live without it, so I did consume it almost daily. Maybe it's not good, but since I'm feeling great, I can not really say that. Here's the chart: [https://i.postimg.cc/90FFybLt/carbs.png](https://i.postimg.cc/90FFybLt/carbs.png).

Also, here's the chart on the same thing for KCal, although I don't find it interesting at all: [https://i.postimg.cc/BQbn6hLJ/kcal.png](https://i.postimg.cc/BQbn6hLJ/kcal.png)

# My rules

I've set a few rules/advice that I follow since:

**ATTENTION: I AM NOT AN EXPERT OR A DOCTOR. PLEASE DO NOT CONSIDER IT A MEDICAL ADVICE OF ANY SORT. CONSULT WITH YOUR TRUSTED NUTRITIONIST BEFORE APPLYING ANY OF RULES LISTED BELOW.**

1. **eat what I enjoy eating and what is allowed on keto**: mostly meat, cheese, and eggs
2. **eat only products with less than 5 g of carbs per 100 g of a product** (so that I can not eat too many carbs)
3. **eat almost no vegetables** (just because I don't really enjoy them, I am more on the carnivore side)
4. **drink no carbonated water** (just plain water or coffee with milk, yeah I am a sinner)
5. **take a break every 3-5 weeks** (cheat meals)
6. **take supplements that my body requires** (omega 3-6-9, vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B12, C, D3, magnesium, calcium)
7. **try to fast** (sometimes I have had even a 3-hour eating window and I didn't have a feeling that I want to eat outside of it)

My only complaint to those rules is that it doesn't involve sports activities and it is definitely what I need to add to achieve more for sure.

# My feelings while applying these rules the first time

I had some problems the first time, of course:

* I felt the famous keto flu for 2-3 days sometimes after the cheat days, but sometimes I didn't feel it at all
* getting rid of soda was bad. That's just some drugs for sure: I had a strong desire to drink it ""just one more time"". Thankfully, after 2 days of this ""narcotic hangover"", I was able to get to like plain water and not think about any sparkling water again. Even though it was no-sugar soda for me, I had been drinking it for several years almost without consuming plain water at all. So I am happy that I don't drink it anymore.

# My feelings overall

Here's my weight loss chart since September 2:

[https://i.postimg.cc/tJtW4BY3/weight-loss.png](https://i.postimg.cc/tJtW4BY3/weight-loss.png)

I am extremely happy with the results so far:

* I have no ""visual"" issues with my health now (I don't feel that something's terribly wrong with me). I'm convinced that it would be even better later
* I have much more energy throughout the day
* I almost don't sweat even when I'm walking by stairs in a heated house wearing a winter jacket with a scarf, hoodie, and a t-shirt underneath it. Last winter I would be so wet if I did this :D
* I have more sexual drive than before (obviously, my testosterone is going up - I feel that I want to do jiu-jitsu and I stand my ground much more than before, damn instincts haha)
* I don't feel amazing while eating something sweet during cheat days: I like what I eat while on keto. So cheat days are mostly for my mental health, not for my body's craving for something that includes sugar.
* I've cured my brain fog (my thoughts were that clear last time in 2015 when I lost 40 kg (88.2 lbs) on the high carbs / low-fat diet that my nutritionist advised me to do at the time)
* I have more money in my pocket since fast food is more expensive than what I've been eating so far. Also, plain water for me was 4 times less expensive than soda
* I'm not going to the toilet every 4-5 hours, more like once a day without some sort of diarrhea
* I feel stronger than before. I even feel that my bicepses have grown a bit and it's kind of links to the increased protein consumption, but I don't do sports now, so I don't know if that's true (I also have never measured it).

Now onto the downsides:

* I feel cold sometimes (I live in Moscow, Russia, so that's an issue), but being non-sweaty all the time is definitely a perk I didn't think that I would have while I'm still fat
* I experience bad breath all the time while in ketosis. But it has an upside -&gt; I'm taking even more care of my hygiene than before, that never hurts :)
* Dermatitis (eczema) on my hands and head has gotten worse. Although I have it every winter, so I can not directly link it to the keto diet. Maybe that's because of the change in my hormones or because it's somewhat different weather that we're having to what had been last winter. I'm also getting older, soooo... \*shrugs\*

# Afterwords

Wow, you've read it. Thank you for your time!

Feel free to ask me questions. Also, if you're having some sort of advice, I'll be happy to listen to you, that's why we're here after all.

If you guys support this idea, maybe sometime later I'll share the dataset I've collected. I record my sleeping time, walking data, as well as all the intakes I have throughout the day (food, drinks, supplements), and, of course, weight measures."
keto,Can't hit my calorie limit without going over macros.,"Hey y'all, I am new to Keto. Doing it for about 5 days now. I've noticed that I can't hit my calorie limit which is 1610 without going over in my macros. Some days I go over in my carb limit, other days it's been protein. So, I can't seem to reach 1610 without going over in one or more of the amounts. I worry it will affect me going or staying in ketosis. Any suggestions? (Using Carb Manager to track)

Net Calorie limit: 1610 Cal

Macros:

Carbs: 20g

Protein: 101g

Fat: 125g"
keto,Any apps that calculate portion size for set macros?,"Hi all,

My wife and I have been on our keto journey for just over 3 months (hit our 100 day anniversary last week) and are loving it so far. I've tried just about every planning/tracking app out there and haven't found one that helps to figure out the ""best"" quantity mix per day to get as close to macro targets as possible - apps are generally manual in nature and allow you to select foods items and add a quantity of each, then see your resulting macros.

My question is: is there an app that allows you to select the food items that you want to eat in the day, then the app calculates the best quantity of each to get you closest to your macro targets? For example, last meal of the day, I know I want chicken, broccoli and ghee and have x carbs/cals/fat/protein remaining, what qualities of each food item would get me closest across the board. ""Eat This Much"" has a similar component but the generation piece seems to be on the food items/recipes rather than on the portion of items you've selected. Curious if anyone has any other app recommendations to try."

keto,Lockdown Transformation," Hello Reddit,

I would like to share my story with you during the quarantine period. Because of the lockdown, I figured out that the only way to train is with bodyweight exercises and that's how I found out about callisthenics. I completely changed my diet during this period, lost around 20 kilos and managed to see my abs for the first time at the age of 31. From any situation, we can get the best out of it if we just believe in ourselves. If you want to, you can watch my full story [here](https://youtu.be/W8Y05uY790A) ."

keto,"320 Days difference - Keto On and Off, forever life changing habits","Hi all, i have posted multiple times on different subs regarding my weight loss both sharing what works and asking for help, this is my first post here i hope it inspire/help people achieve their goals

Stats:  
M / 26 / 178 cm ( 5'10.5"" )
SW : 213 lbs ( 96.6 kg )
CW : 143 lbs ( 64.9 kg )
Around 32 kg/70 lbs bettwen 2 pics.

First pic was taken on 28 January 2020 , and last one was today morning. I was so excited i achieved a new milestone.

First 6 months was the strictest regarding my diet i was on Keto and fasting at least 18 Hours each day ( it was easier to fast on keto honestly ), then i switched to a cyclical Keto , in which i do keto for 7 to 10 days and break it for 3 to 4 days ( i found this easier to maintain as i wanted to workout by then and gain some muscle for better looking body not just weight loss ), I didn't expect to loss weight during my upped calories and more carbs but the suprise was that i just kept losing weight ( slower of course ) .

By the end of September i was completely out of Keto and incorporated a more moderate carb consumption for better adherence, i didn't lose weight at all during this 30 days from end of September to end of November, it was ok i was working out hard and still making progress in gym.

Last month, exactly on 28 November i switched back to keto and If but with a much higher calories intake to keep up with my workout, and i started losing weight again and went from 68.3 kg to today's weight in of 64.9 kg.

- all i wanted to really share here is that consistency is key to any progress, i love keto and it's instant rewarding feeling, but for me cycling in and out of keto is what really break stalls for me and kept me going.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

keto,Why nobody talks about all the anti nutrients in vegetables and all the issue that goes along with it?," **Don't you love it when you hear how good and healthy fruits/vegetables are for you? How you need fiber and all those good vitamins/minerals which are all lacking in animal foods (check part one to see the actual truth). Let's talk about something that is usually not mentioned, the anti-nutrients present in plants.**

 

## 2. ANTINUTRIENTS IN PLANT-BASED FOODS

### 2.1. Lectins

Lectins, particularly abundant in plants, are proteins or glycoproteins of non-immune origin. They have the ability to bind, without modifying, to either carbohydrates or glyco-conjugates (glycoproteins, glycolipids, polysaccharides). They can successfully recognize animal cell carbohydrates, which corresponds to the Latin derivation of the word legere meaning to select \[[21](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r21)\]. Lectins have a variety of roles. They can bypass human defense system and travel all over the body causing diseases (*i.e.* Crohn’s disease, Coeliac-Sprue, colitis, *etc*.) by breaking down the surface of the small intestine \[[22](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r22)\]. When large quantities of lectins are introduced in the body, the gut wall develops holes, and intestinal permeability, causing the leaky gut syndrome. Lectins can make cells act as if they have been stimulated by insulin or cause the insulin release by the pancreas. Lectins can also cause autoimmune diseases by presenting wrong immune system codes and stimulating the growth of some white blood cells \[[23](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r23), [24](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r24)\]. This may possibly lead to cancer but lectins have not yet been recognized as cancer causing.

Not all variety of lectins are toxic or responsible for intestinal damage. Lectins can be found in plant species such as wheat, beans, quinoa, peas, *etc.* \[[25](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r25)\]. As grains are a common part of the birds’ diet, it has been found that birds themselves are resistant to grains lectins \[[26](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r26)\]. Acne, inflammation, migraines or joint pains can be caused by the consumption of lectins \[[27](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r27)\]. Lectins are usually found in the hull so choosing white rice can lower the lectin intake. Heating plant sources in the process of cooking can significantly lower the amount of lectins in them. White potatoes, for instance, have a higher lectin content compared to sweet potatoes \[[28](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r28)\]. Almonds are also a richer lectin source than peanuts \[[29](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r29)\].

### 2.2. Trypsin Inhibitors

Trypsin inhibitors occur in a wide range of foods like chickpeas, soybeans, red kidney beans, adzuki beans, mung beans and other representatives of the Leguminoseae, Solanaceae, and Gramineae families \[[30](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r30)\]. Ten percent of the world’s dietary protein is derived from grain legumes \[[31](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r31)\]. Trypsin inhibitors redound to the loss of trypsin and chymo-trypsin in the gut, thus preventing protein digestion. Excess trypsin synthesis and burden on sulfur-containing amino acids in requirement of the body are due to the release of chole-cystokinin triggered by trypsin inhibitors \[[32](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r32)\].

### 2.3. Alpha-amylase Inhibitors

Inhibition of α-amylase is considered a strategy for the treatment of disorders in carbohydrate uptake, by reducing insulin levels, as well as, dental caries and periodontal diseases \[[33](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r33)\]. Amylase inhibitors are substances that bind to alpha amylases making them inactive \[[34](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r34)\]. Two roles of α-amylase inhibitors have been identified. The primary function of inhibitors is protecting the seed against microorganisms and pests, and the other function is the inhibition of the endogenous α-amylase \[[35](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r35)\]. However, the instability of this inhibitor under the conditions of the gastrointestinal tract and being a very heat-liable constituent results in its failure to be used as starch blocker \[[36](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r36)\]. It is used to control human diabetes type two \[[37](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r37)\] and finds several applications in the food industry \[[38](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r38), [39](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r39)\].

### 2.4. Protease Inhibitors

Proteases are key cell-process-regulation enzymes that are found in all cells and tissues. Protease inhibitors are commonly present in raw cereals and legumes, especially soybean. Protease inhibitors bind to their target proteins reversibly or irreversibly. Growth inhibition, pancreatic hypertrophy \[[40](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r40)\], and poor food utilization \[[41](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r41)\] are associated with protease inhibitors’ antinutrient activity. Exopeptidases remove amino acids from the C- or N-terminus, whereas endopeptidases are capable of cleaving peptides within the molecule \[[42](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r42)\]. Grain eating birds have evolved digestive enzymes that are resistant to grain protease inhibitors \[[26](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r26)\]. In human volunteers and in animal experiments, high levels of protease inhibitors lead to an increased secretion of digestive enzymes by the pancreas \[[43](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r43)\].

&amp;#x200B;

### 2.5. Tannins

Plant tannins are a major group of antioxidant polyphenols found in food and beverages that attracts research interest with its multifunctional properties to human health. Tannins are oligomers of flavan-3-ols and flavan-3, 4-diols that are concentrated in the bran fraction of legumes \[[44](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r44)\]. Grapes and green tea are rich in this water-soluble polyphenol \[[45](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r45)\]. Tannins exhibit antinutritional properties by impairing the digestion of various nutrients and preventing the body from absorbing beneficial bioavailable substances \[[46](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r46)\]. Tannins can also bind and shrink proteins. Tannin-protein complexes may cause digestive enzymes inactivation and protein digestibility reduction caused by protein substrate and ionisable iron interaction \[[47](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r47)\].

### 2.6. Phytates

Phytates occur in several vegetable products. Seeds, grains, nuts and legumes store phosphorus as phytic acid in their husks in the form of phytin or phytate salt. Their presence may affect bioavailability of minerals, solubility, functionality and diges-tibility of proteins and carbohydrates \[[41](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r41)\]. Phytic acid is most concentrated in the bran of grains \[[48](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r48)\]. In legumes, phytic acid is found in the cotyledon layer and can be removed prior to consumption \[[49](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r49)\]. The digestive enzyme phytase can unlocked the phosphorus stored as phytic acid. In the absence of phytase, phytic acid can impede the absorption of other minerals like iron, zinc, magnesium and calcium by binding to them \[[50](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r50)\]. This results in highly insoluble salts that are poorly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract leading to lower bioavailability of minerals. Phytates also inhibit digestive enzymes like pepsin, trypsin and amylase \[[51](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r51)\].

### 2.7. Goitrogens

Hypothyroidism is increasing daily worldwide as the thyroid gland is highly sensitive to stress and environmental stimuli \[[52](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r52)\]. Goitrogens interfere with iodine uptake and thus, affect thyroid function. Vegetables from the genus Brassica *i.e.* broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and kale are some of the goitrogen rich foods \[[53](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r53)\]. The consumption of cruciferous vegetables affects triiodothyronine (T3) and thy-roxine (T4) levels by causing hypothyroidism \[[54](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r54)\]. Concomi-tant factors can be insufficient water consumption and protein malnutrition \[[55](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r55)\].

### 2.8. Raffinose Oligosaccharides

Raffinose, stachyose and verbascose, all part of the Raffinose Family Oligosaccharides (RFOs), are synthesized from sucrose. Non-digestible oligosaccarides have a prebiotic effect in the lower intestine by promoting the growth of *Bifidobacterium* and *Lactobacillus* that inhibit pathogenic growth \[[56](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r56)\]. The absence of appropriate enzyme activity to hydrolyse RFOs (α-galactosidase) leads to the inability of humans and to digest RFOs an allow them to pass through the intestinal wall intact \[[51](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r51), [57](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r57)\]. A correlation between legumes consumption and the likelihood of intestinal discomfort has been drawn leading to symptoms like burping, abdominal pain, and bloating \[[57](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r57)\]. The presence of RFO in the daily food intake can interfere with the digestion nutrients \[58\]. RFO can reduce metabolizable energy and protein utilization \[[59](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r59)\]. Research has shown that RFO removal has improved the digestion of all amino acids increasing the overall nutritional value of the lupin diet \[[60](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r60)\].

### 2.9. Saponins

Some saponins (steroid or triterpene glycoside compounds) can be used for food while others are toxic. Saponins with a bitter taste are toxic in high concentrations and can affect nutrient absorption by inhibiting enzymes (metabolic and digestive) as well as by binding with nutrients such as zinc. Saponins are naturally occurring substances with various biological effects. In the presence of cholesterol, saponins exhibit strong hypocholesterolemic effect \[[61](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r61)\]. They can also lead to hypoglycemia \[[62](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r62)\] or impair the protein digestion, uptake vitamins and minerals in the gut, as well as lead to the development of a leaky gut \[[63](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r63)\].

### 2.10. Oxalates

Some organic acids can have antinutritional factors. Oxalic acid can form soluble (potassium and sodium) or insoluble (calcium, magnesium, iron) salts or esters called oxalates that are commonly found in plants *i.e.* leafy vegetables or syn-thesized in the body \[[64](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r64)\]. Insoluble salts cannot be processed out of the urinary tract once processed through the digestive system. Calcium oxalate can have a deleterious effect on human nutrition and health by accumulating kidney stones \[[65](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r65)\]. Cruciferous vegetables (kale, radishes, cauliflower, broccoli), as well as chard, spinach, parsley, beets, rhubarb, black pepper, chocolate, nuts, berries (blueberries, black-berries) and beans are some of the foods with high amounts of oxalates \[[66](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r66)\]. Most people can induct normal amounts of oxalate rich foods, while people with certain conditions, such as enteric and primary hyperoxaluria, need to lower their oxalate intake. In sensitive people, even small amounts of oxalates can result in burning in the eyes, ears, mouth, and throat; large amounts may cause abdominal pain, muscle weakness, nausea, and diarrhea \[[67](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r67)\].

Table [**1**](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#T1) is revealing some food sources with the typical antinutrients contained in them as well as the amounts variables.

### 2.11. Exorphins

The alcohol-soluble proteins (proalimins) of cereal grains and dairy products called gliadins can be further degraded to a collection of opioid-like polypeptides named exorphins in the gastrointestinal tract \[[81](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r81)\]. Behavioral traits such as spon-taneous behavior, memory, and pain perception can be affected by the bioactivity of food-derived exorphins \[[82](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r82)\]. Exorphins can also influence gastric emptying and intestinal transit by increasing its time \[[83](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r83)\]. The digestion of milk produces alpha-casein-derived exorphins \[[84](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r84)\]. Recent research suggests that epigenetic effects of milk-derived opiate peptides may contribute to gastrointestinal dysfunction and inflam-mation in sensitive individuals \[[85](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r85)\].

Fig. ([**1**](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#F1)) pinpoints some of the widely speard antinutrients in plant-based foods.

### 2.12. Contextual Antinutrients

Some supplements or foods rich in certain nutrients can create reactions of an antinutrient nature. For instance, calcium-rich foods can impede iron absorption. There is also a mutual antagonism between zinc and copper during the absorption process, taking place in/on the intestinal epithelium \[[86](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r86)\]. Research literature suggests that phytosterols \[[87](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r87)\] and phospholipids \[[88](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r88)\] may reduce cholesterol absorption when added to nonfat foods. Some foods can interfere with medication absorption \[[89](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r89)\]. The most well publicized food-drug interaction is that of grapefruit and a variety of drugs. Bergamottin found in grapefruit juice inactivates drug-metabolizing enzymes. This is the reason why food interaction warnings are listed on some medical labels. Studies have found that resveratrol, found in red wine and peanuts, inhibits platelet aggregation, and high intakes could increase the risk of bleeding when consumed with anticoagulant drugs \[[90](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r90)\]. Canadian researchers have documented that black tea was a more powerful enzyme inhibitor than single-ingredient herbal teas (St. John’s Wort, feverfew, cat’s claw, *etc*.) \[[91](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r91)\]. Another well-known food-drug interaction is that of foods containing tyramine (chocolate, beer, wine, avocados, *etc*.) and mono-amine oxidase inhibitors (type of antidepressant) \[[92](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r92)\]. The most medically consequential food-drug interaction is that of vitamin K-rich foods (*e.g.* broccoli, spinach) and Coumadin, an anticoagulant prescribed to thin the blood and prevent clots \[[93](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOBIOTJ-13-68#r93)\].

## CONCLUSION

Antinutritional factors are widespread food compounds that are especially challenging for those choosing a predominantly plant-based diet *i.e*. vegan, vegetarians, *etc*. Antinutrients can exhibit beneficial health effects if present in small amounts or cause nutrient deficiencies. Uninformed consumers may deal with some misleading information when the latter is not sufficiently available. Antinutrients may induce their undesirable effects when consumed above their upper limit. Harmful effects can also be due to antinutritional breakdown products. Thus, the presence of lectins, tannins, alkaloids, and saponins, goitrogens, inhibitors, *etc*. in foods may induce various reactions when the consumer is presented with little knowledge related to the environmental influence on the detoxification capacity of the human organism. Classic approaches and modern agricultural biotechnological programs can serve as antinutritional removal tools. However, health risk factors can be avoided when a daily sustainable diet lying on a sound scientific basis is introduced.

keto,Tips for a lazy piece of shit?,"I'm so used to eating ready tasty food like from the shops or a fast food restaurant. Keto is pretty much all done yourself and most times I can't stick to it because I just go back to the convenience of pre packaged foods (that aren't keto)

keto,Keto for helping with bulimia and cravings,"Hey there,  


after randomly seeing some posts and then reading more on the potential benefits of keto for bulimia/binge eating disorder in terms of regulating appetite, I've decided to give it a commited attempt.  


I've been bulimic for 14 years (oh my, it is horrifying to see it black on white). Even though my episodes are not as severe as few years ago, they still happen. I'm also seeing a psychologist for CBT, and even though it helps me to understand and manage the psychological triggers, I feel like the addictive habit for binging/purging and preoccupation with food is not going away.   
Especially, I have a tendency to eat many very small portions throughout the day, which leads to a disordered eating and I cannot get myself to be really hungry and then satisfied as if I had a proper-sized meal. I think this is caused by my general sensitivity to even small blood glucose fluctuations, induced by years with my eating disorder. I act on every small sensation of what I perceive as ""hunger"", but really is just a craving caused by fluctuations (albeit this is only my interpretation, not backed by any measurements). Also, I have trouble with standard-sized portions, as they cause the feeling of being ""full"", which due to my history immediately causes distress and anxiety. On top of it, I have problem with reflux.  


It's been only my first week on keto, but I already notice that the feelings of hunger and being full have completely different qualities than with carb-based foods. I consciously think about the possibility to eat snacks regularly throughout the day (just as I did before),  but I simply don't act on it. I think that like I \*might\*, but I just don't want to. It is indeed difficult to differentiate if this is only caused by my commitment or if it has effect on impulse supression too. I'd love to see studies made on this, as it makes so much sense.

I also did not have any issue with reflux at all. Probably the combination of macronutrients is digested in stomach in a slightly different way and is thus less upsetting - has anyone experienced that?

I know there were posts on this topic in this sub earlier, but if there is anyone struggling at the moment, I'd love to hear your experience and hopefully, progress!"
keto,"Face gains, sometimes you need some motivation.","After thanksgiving with lot of food, I started losing motivation. It’s kinda hard to work from home, and don’t snack all the time. Got my motivation back, definitely after seeing my picture. Lost total 90 pounds so far. Started with 340. Currently at 250 pounds.

keto,When your future self isn't enough,"Hi friends! I'm restarting again.

Even though they'd support me whole-heartedly, I'm too embarrassed to tell friends that I want to get in shape again until I've actually stuck to it for a few weeks. I'm embarrassed that's even in question – I want to live a happy and healthy life and manage some autoimmune disorders, and keto helps me do that.

But sometimes, when I'm at my lowest, myself is not a strong enough reason to sustain my willpower. When I'm staring down an entire loaf of fresh sourdough with butter (or even a still-keto-but-high-calorie binge on low-carb food) it's that others are counting on me that stops me from falling (flinging myself) off the wagon.

I'd love to have the diligence to make the right choice for the long term in each of those short term moments. But sometimes, knowing our success is important to others is the thing that gets us through, when our own care for our future selves fails us.

So I can't tell you how much I appreciate everyone putting themselves out there. Every day that you keep going motivates me – so please, keep going! And by sharing I hope to motivate you, so I know that every day I stick to it is helping someone else.

If you've been doing it a while, I'm proud of you. If you're joining me in restarting, I'm proud of both of us."
keto,A little encouragement for 2021,"For all the “2020 Sucked” stuff that I see online, for sale to put on Christmas trees or whatever...look, there’s no guarantee that 2021 is going to be better.

The only thing that you can be assured of is that the best way to ensure you improve despite uncertain future circumstances is to act in the present in a way that guides you toward the positive outcome that you want.

If you’re waiting for the “right time” to have your breakout year, there’s always going to be some reason or some thing that stands in your way.  Stop looking for the magic moment, the perfect storm, or the right reason.  Stop searching for motivation to do, and start doing to find motivation.  

Waiting just makes for more uncertainty, more weakness, and more kicking the can down the road.  If you want 2021 to be better, it has to begin with you.  Better habits, better behavior, better choices, better outcome.  The world is going to do whatever it is going to do.  At some point you have to ask yourself two questions:

1.  What does that have to do with my goals?
2.  Where the hell are my workout clothes.

Everything else is noise.  
Everything else is distraction.

I will NEVER diminish the hurt and loss that COVID has left on the world, but last time I looked, every one of you reading this is still alive, still breathing, and still capable.  Able to adapt and improvise in order to achieve the goals you set out to do.  Stop blaming the year for your choices, stop blaming the government for your decisions.  

You can put down the fork and do some exercise right from your house.  They haven’t made that illegal yet!"

I decided to step on the scale tonight - feeling ready to face the damage and start trying to turn my world around.

keto,Carb amounts with exercise .,"Hi, first week trying a keto diet and I have some questions about macros and exercise.

So if i ride my bike (road bike, 60 minutes , 1500 feet of climbing) roughly 600 is calories. Do i still keep the recommended carbs? It says i can have a max of 28, but its impossible to eat anything and stay under that number. Carb manager does not seem to adjust for exercise so if i eat lets say 10-12 grams more carbs a day i ride  will i never get i to ketosis? I have been eating constantly under 45 grams for 7 days and I do not seem to getting into that state no matter what."

keto,nsv: lash extensions,"this is going to be a bit of a silly one and uninteresting to most but it was a huge step for me today. 

i’ve gotten lash extensions on and off for years. if you don’t know, you’re usually laying flat for anywhere from 1-3 hours. your eyes are closed the whole time as the technician is apply eyelashes. because you’re laying there for so long with your eyes closed and it’s typically a quiet cozy room, most people tend to doze off at some point. 

as much as i enjoyed having my lashes done, i also dreaded the appointments. i was so afraid to fall asleep because i know that i snored (especially laying on my back) and i was SO self conscious about it. i’d spend the whole appointment forcing myself to stay awake to the point of being uncomfortable and anxious. 

today i had an appt. for the first time this year. i’ve really made progress in losing weight these last six months (25lbs) so as i laid there, eventually i started to doze off. and i did, and i wasn’t worried or embarrassed - because i don’t snore anymore!

such a little thing but wow, i felt so comfortable with myself."

keto,Nothing but egg yolks..,Thoughts on just 48 truly pastured organic raw egg yolks and some electrolyte'd water? Eggs are the purest keto food. Better captures nutrient requirements than other options. Noteworthy is the extra choline and selenium. It is further convenient due to presence of sufficient vitamin D and DHA.
keto,Trouble eating enough calories,I’m a male and I’d say decently active. Since I’ve started keto I’ve had a TON trouble just eating enough calories for it to be safe. For example I came in at 1100 calories I’m 5 foot 6 (short I know) but keto just hasn’t made me hungry I have no problems eating whatsoever if you give me something to eat I’ll absolutely eat it but I’ve gotten to a point where I’m drinking raw olive oil in a tablespoon to get enough calories.

keto,"4 years on Paleo, ready for Keto","46, 5’8, 149

I used to do fast HIIT workouts for 20 min/3 times/week that involved springs and 2lb jump ropes, but now I’m going to do slower paced jogs for the moment. 

I checked out Dr. Eric Berg DC’s YouTube videos and I have a game plan, but is there something else I can use as sort of a daily guide when and if I get stumped? 

An app for example that has proven to be worthwhile of a download?"
keto,"Wife Miserable: Tried the keto diet, severe reaction. How can she quickly reverse?","She only started a week ago. Keto flu started on the second day. Past 48 hours have been miserable; diarrhea multiple times a day, at least 4 times a night. Been replenishing electrolytes, no relief. She was told that it is rare, but some people have a negative reaction to ketosis and the symptoms sound accurate. 

I’ve googled and dug, but most of the answers are geared to either help people transition out who have been in for a long time, or giving advice how to quickly get back in when accidentally knocked out. 

What should she eat/drink/do to quickly get out of ketosis? Is it as simple as eating some carbs? I apologize for the “anti-question,” but I don’t know where else to turn. Reddit, show us the way. 

(If it helps, I’m successfully attempting the diet and am not feeling the same level of misery and intestinal catastrophe. Yet. And I’m planning on sticking with it.)"
keto,Keto Rash Cure,"Hello all,

A bit of backstory: My GF successfully ate keto for three months and lost solid weight. However, one evening she went to a spa with some friends and from that day afterwards she got the rash everytime she went into ketosis.

It was horrible and heavily affected her face. I've read similar stories about others getting the rash after being in humid environments. From reading we knew antibiotics would work, but that they are harmful to gut flora and offer only a short-term solution.

We tried:

Vitamins
Bile Salts
Black Seed Oil
Anti-histimines
Clotrimazole 1% (Lotromin)
Pyrithione Zinc 2% (Noble Formula face soap)
Tolnaftate 1% (Defense body soap)


What worked:

Selenium Sulfide 1% (Selsun Blue)
Apply to effected areas and let sit for a few min, then rinse. 

Hope this helps others continue the diet!"
keto,Hypoglycemia,"So I've been doing a low carb diet for about 4 weeks (&lt;70g carbs/day) and a keto diet (\~40g carbs/day) for about 1.5 weeks. Interestingly I have zero change in my weight (130#). I was Paleo before this, so it's possible that because I never had to cut out sugar and junk food to get where I am now, I haven't seen a big difference. I don't think I'm really in ketosis because my blood sugar is still unstable, but HUGELY improved from before. 

That's my primary question: I'm diabetic (CFRD, no drugs needed) and I have reactive hypoglycemia. My BS is more stable than it has been in years, yet I cannot figure out how to not dip into hypoglycemia at night. I wake up in the mid to upper 60's, and occasionally in the high 50's. Then I have to correct with a little bit of carbs (a 2-4g glucose tab) once or twice at night in order to stay safe, which probably continues my dependence on the glycogen cycle. 

Anyone have advice on how to make the ketosis switch quicker in order to help me stay out of this carb-feeding loop? It seems like every time I correct a low, I perpetuate my dependence on carbs. It's frustrating, but I have to stay safe. 

Last note: for the last week-ish I've had weird heart arrhythmias (premature ventricular contractions) which I deduced was from magnesium deficiency, and after supplementing with magnesium for 4 days, it's significantly improved. Is this related to the keto diet? 

Thanks!"

keto,Never enough magnesium,"I've been on and off keto / low carb/ omad for a few years now. Now it's been about 2 months that I've been strict keto. Problem is that when I go keto I can't seem to keep enough electrolytes in me.

Now I eat more than 10-15g of salt a day and supplement 1g of elemental magnesium (from bisglycinate or threonate, spread evenly during the day) but every morning I feel I'm at risk of cramping. 

Things are even worse when I run (i don't now as I'm recovering from a tendinitis) as I do 10k three times a week and of course sweat a lot.

keto,"Thanks to this sub, I've found a keto morning/afternoon routine that has been an absolute game changer. So excited to continue this journey!","So, background: I've tried doing keto a couple times before. I usually stick with it for a few weeks and then stop. In the past, I've tried to pile on too much at the same time: keto, intermittent fasting, etc, but without much intentionality. And I would always, always get these terrible headaches, which I thought eating salt and chugging water would fix. But it didn't, and I would lose motivation.

I've been experimenting with various morning routines to try to find one that would start my day off right. A good start to the day is key! And I'm excited to say I've finally found one that works for me, thanks to reading the info on this sub. Right after waking up, I do the following - 

* Vitamin D3 supplement: this has been an absolute game changer for me. Turns out I was super deficient in vitamin D (like most people apparently), and a couple weeks of supplementation and now maintenance make me a lot happier.
* Vitamin C supplement and one bouillon cube
* 15 mins of light therapy: I bought a 10000 lux lamp from Amazon and use it each morning. Helps fight off the seasonal affective disorder that seems to occur during the winter months.

After that, I do HIIT for 30 minutes.

Thanks to the benefits of keto, I don't even feel hungry until afternoon-ish. In the afternoon, I drink coffee + 1 tbsp MCT oil + 1 tbsp butter (thanks to this sub for letting me know about this coffee recipe). The caffeine + fat energizes me, and I don't get hungry until around 5PM. I eat dinner then, not more than a couple hundred calories, and stop eating around 8PM. 

What I've found is that a good morning routine has been so beneficial. And simply eating salt isn't enough: I've found I need to be more intentional about getting sodium in, so I finally started following the advice here to drink broth. (I'm too lazy to make the broth, so I just chew the bouillon cube and take it with water).

To those of you who started recently like me, I know it can be hard. There's so much uncertainty going into a new lifestyle like this, and often times it requires a lot of tweaking to find what works best for you. But stick with it, try various things that might help you stick with this diet, and you will see phenomenal results. And, again, thank you to everyone in this sub - you're all great."

Does anybody have any advice with dealing with cravings like this? Or is it worth it to indulge every once and a while?"
keto,Incidentally Keto’d with Covid and got some unexpected but greatly welcomed results.,"SW:194 CW:181

I never meant to do keto, and despite hearing of it didn’t really know what it was. The other day (11.29) I lost all sense of taste, and my s/o works in healthcare and was quick to promptly issue a rapid test. Result was positive for COVID-19. A combination of lack of appetite, nausea, and no ability to taste anything prompted me to fast for the 3 days prior to receiving my diagnosis. I had zero intention of doing so, and coincidentally my last meal was avacado, bell peppers, and 6 eggs, the morning before symptoms started to kick in. After the 3 days, it was evident I needed to begin eating due to sluggishness and need for fuel. But with no palette to enjoy my carbs, I just stuck to fats and whey protein shakes with veggies. Probably a massive deficit as I had no desire to eat but all I can say is wow. I haven’t lost much size if at all; obviously not lifting right now and will lose some hard earned muscle mass but this is definitely the best I’ve felt in a long time, even for as miserable as I am symptomatically. It’s a near neutral offset. I’m pounding fluids and micronutrients, thankfully have before photos from a trip, and am excited to give it a full 30 days to see how it turns out. I obviously don’t recommend a severe deficit like this as I know I have lost some strength and but I was too nauseous to keep food down within maintenance caloric intake. 5’9 male, 25 y/o, and in best shape of my life to begin with but definitely a beer guy with a non chiseled midsection before. What do keto folks enjoy on a Friday evening if at all? Any tips for someone who usually runs 2-3 miles a morning before the shower and tries to snag an hour of lifting in the evening if the day allows? Used to be SUPER carb loaded 24/7 thinking that was my energy but it seems to have made me a bit fluffy and I’m definitely enjoying this more sculpted less inflated physique/ have had more mental clarity than I can recall without 5 cups of coffee. Any advice is greatly appreciated. No allergies and milk friendly. 

Tl,Dr: got COVID, accidentally keto’d myself without knowing what it was and shed what looks to be a significant amount of body fat and water weight with minimal muscle loss in a severe deficit. Going to continue!"
keto,Life after Keto advice and help thread.,"Hi guys my name is Austin, I started doing keto when I was 20, I was 350lbs at the time, and I keto’d and exercised all the way down to 250lbs. After my food addiction resurfaced, I find myself now at 343 pounds at 25 years old. It’s pretty depressing for me to think about, how could I let myself get so heavy again? Why couldn’t I manage my eating better? It’s pretty hard stuff to self-analyze, for me. I want to give anyone starting, or rebounding some useful tips to expect once you start losing, and the positives and bad side of Keto.

The AMAZING side of Keto, is it helps weight come off fast, and for health reasons that is incredible. Obviously when we’re all heavy, we’re shaving years off our lives. We need to get the weight off quickly and safely, and Keto provides that medium for us. Now once I lost 100lbs due to keto, I was able to maintain for a bit, but slowly my bad eating habits came back, and before I knew it, I gained it all back.

So my greatest helpful tip, is plan for a life after a Keto diet. Go ahead and start planning how you will eat and exercise differently once keto stops. Set a weight goal, and once you achieve start leaning off of keto into a simple healthy LIFESTYLE. So you don’t have to be like me, and gain 100lbs back that you have to lose again, it would’ve been easier to keep it off then to have to lose it again. 

Keto is good, it helps us lose quickly, but once you stop, it comes back even faster. So from someone who has Succeeded on Keto and quickly gained all my weight back. Please plan for life after Keto.

As of November 28th I was 343lbs, and now I’m down to 334lbs, so I’m back on the wagon and working hard at it. This time I won’t have to lose it again, I’m going to plan properly for a healthy lifestyle once I get my weight down. 

I’m so proud to be apart of this sub, you guys are inspiring. Keep up the great work, and if anyone wants to message me, and keep up, or if you need any advice, please message me. I’d love to help anyone I can on their journeys.

Sorry if some of this post sounds Depressing or almost Militant towards Keto, this was just on my mind and I felt like this is something people struggle with. I’m not a great writer, so please don’t kill me if it all sound off."
keto,Need some feedback!! :),"1 month on Keto. Need some feedback :)

Hi everyone! 

I've been on strict keto for the past month. I started on the 3rd of November and had two cheat days (Thanksgiving) and wanted to get some feedback on my progress so far. To me, I feel like I haven't lost weight but I wanted to get other people's POV. 

I haven't weighed myself (it's a mistake, I know) but I'm trying not to obsess over the scale because the last time I did keto, I ended up giving up because the scale wasn't moving. So this time I decided to do it without stepping on one and just trying to judge my weight loss by clothing items etc. 

Let me know if you guys see any difference. I'm finding it hard to see one! Thank you in advance!!! :)

This may seem like a minor victory but it made me smile when looking in the mirror for the first time in a long long time.

January will be the official 2 year mark since I started Keto. Although I don’t track fat or carbs anymore and have never really tracked calories, I’ve just stuck to the early things keto taught me about food choices and how food should be portioned. Completely kept things out like soda, candy; always very little sugar. It’s been hard now because I haven’t been able to go to the gym in nearly 8 months (I live in a covid hotspot), but I’ve been supplementing that with tough at home workouts using a weighted backpack. 😊😊 Before the lockdown I was following a pretty strict PPL lifting plan. Keep grinding ya’ll!"
keto,Minute Maid Zero Sugar Lemonade: When you want a change from flavored water....,"Will cost you (for an 8oz glass) 1 NC and zero calories for the lemonade flavored. But, the strawberry flavored will be 1 NC and 5 calories. I opted for the lemonade flavored; didn't try the strawberry.  Found is easily at Walmart and my local Schnucks (here in the STL) for about $2.20. Tastes really good but, 8oz is only 1 cup; can go quickly.."
keto,Is there any use in irregularly having low-carb days/weeks even if you can't get into ketosis?,"Because Of Reasons, I can't really diet full time right now - I have two weeks to eat as I please before Christmas, and after that three weeks to new year's. Getting into ketosis apparently can take anything between 1-10 days, so in the two week span it's likely I could only have four days in actual ketosis (where you mainly lose water weight anyhow) before breaking it again.

Is there any use to see-sawing between low/no carb diet and breaking ketosis again? Or would that be more harmful than simply *not* trying to eat clean between now and new year's? Is it easier to get back to ketosis after a week of not eating clean, than if you hadn't tried to do keto in the first place?

keto,How to weigh fat and protein from macros?,"Trying to take this seriously. 

I got my macros which are 118g protein, max 25 carbs, 125g fat for 1699 total cal. But how the hell do I weigh all of that? If I throw a fatty pork country rib on the scale how do you tell how much is fat weight and protein? I’m lost. 

I want to be as precise as I can be. Wondering how everyone else goes about this."
keto,What is the best carb limit for me?,"Since I started last month most sites and books recommend no more that 21 net carbs per day, but now i have seen quite a few that recommed as much  as 40 or 50 to stay in ketoasi....that seems like a big range and I was wondering is it based on activity level or body type or what?"
keto,Keto is synonymous of weight loss?,"Just wondering that since I am started this diet  without the weight in mind, I didn’t measure or weight myself at the time but now close to a month after I started I definitely feel myself much better, and I assume at least some I might lost during this times but not proof of that. 

My question is, if I continue with Keto at least slowly will loose some weight or should I put some restrictions additional to keep away of carbs, sugar, etc ?"
keto,Getting back on track after Thanksgiving. Plus face gains,"Hey everybody. I fell into the old Thanksgiving trap thinking I would just take one day off and then be right back on it. But then I had leftovers. And then I wanted a cheeseburger and it just steamrolled and before I knew it I was back into my old ways. I went from 333 pounds to 349 in only 6 days. I got discouraged I almost gave up. But I managed to force myself back on the wagon and it turns out most of that weight that I had gained was waterweight. Right now I am right now I'm 337 and I'm day two back on keto. 

If you slip up don't despair just get back on it. I know it's easier said than done but you all help me so much with your stories and struggles and I'm hoping that mine can do the same.

I think keto seems to make the average person happier but is it the optimal choice for me?
keto,Not seeing the scales move .,"Hi guys , 

I have been doing the keto diet for a few months now and I haven't noticed the scales move. I started at 200lbs and I fluctuate between 198 -195lbs I really don't know what the issue is. I have done keto before and would have at least dropped by 
at least 20lbs at this stage.

I haven't over ate on fat and I track my carbs closely. I also do IF 5 days a week.



Maybe it's water retention has anyone had this experience before ?"
keto,Do I HAVE TO be on full ketosis?,"I'm currently on a keto but I hate that I have to restrict protein and even my vegtable consumption to stay under 20g of carb. I'm thinking of going low carb diet that is a bit more lenient when it comes to protein and carb in couple wks. I'm worried that since I will be kicked out of ketosis and will be relying on low amounts of carb, I would be tired all the time. Has anyone dealt with fatigue on low carb diet? I'm thinking of ~60g carb"

keto,"Jackpot, I stumbled across a Keto restaurant","I had some time to kill and was wandering around an hour away from home around dinner time tonight.  Out of the corner of my eye, I though I saw something that said carb grill.  I took a closer look and the sign said low carb grill.  Well, I just had to turn around and check this out.  Sure enough, its an entire restaurant dedicated to serving low carb dishes.  Pizzas(they use a fathead crust), zoodle bowls, salads, soups, all sorts of wonderful sides, bakery desserts. 

Their menu lists net carbs/fat/calories/protein and they put full nutrition info on their website.  I ordered a pizza and a side of creamed spinach and mushroom cauliflower risotto.  I also ordered 1 of every dessert item they had.  I only ate a little over half the pizza and one of the desserts(all I had budged for dinner in my macros).  I'll have the rest of the pizza for lunch tomorrow and one of the sides with dinner.

I have a feeling I'll find excuses that take me past that area a little more often now.  I can't help but go out of my way to support a restaurant that fully supports our way of eating.

I'd give more specific details but I don't want to cross over into the advertising them territory."
keto,45 lbs in 3 months!!,"Hi everyone, if it wasn’t for this keto community, I wouldn’t have Reddit, everyone is amazing here.

I started September 3rd at 235 (M,23) and currently weigh 190. I don’t know my goal weight yet but it’s probably in the 160s.

I didn’t start working out until two weeks ago and it’s been great, push pull legs. Going to add cardio in a week.

My meal plan, it’s rough because I’m already a picky eater and lactose intolerant. No breakfast, 4 Eggs for lunch with chili stew. Dinner steak/chicken and rarely fish/pork. I started the diet only eating spinach and strawberries/raspberries outside of the main meals but forced myself to eat broccoli/cabbage/celery/bell pepper/tomatoes. Most of these I hated and now I either like them or getting used to them. Occasionally I’ll make hamburgers or bell pepper tacos and some other meals that are similar. 

I’m going to do a before and after picture post in December of next year. 

I wish everyone success, KCKO!"
keto,Need help reading this food label,"Hi guys,

This is my 4th day cutting carbs so I'm still learning. This morning I grabbed a box of crackers thinking they were low in net carbs, but on closer inspection I'm not sure.

The box reads:
Carbohydrate
-total 10.7g
-sugars 0.6g

That is all it says; there is no separate line for fibre. I assumed this means net carbs are 0.6g per serving but could a cracker really be that low? How do I know what the other 10.1g of carbs are?"

keto,Struggling with body fat,"Hello beautiful people! &lt;3  


I started Keto around 2 weeks ago and I have been loving it so far! I hope to get some huge health gains (Reduce inflammation, I wanna fix my cholesterol levels and mental clarity), but I would like also to burn some damn stubborn body fat (and preserve muscle mass). I don't want to lose weight, because my current weight is very good, regarding my height - **160cm, 50.7Kg**.  
And these are the macros I'm aiming for: **97gr Fats, 84gr Protein, 20gr Carbs** (Calculated on Ruled Me)  
I also do light cardio (like walking), lift weights and Yoga.  
So I have a question for you guys:  


When in Keto, to burn body fat only: What do you thing is the best combination of calories + Intermittent Fasting? (I'm doing 16:8 IF)   
Should I be in a caloric deficit? Should I change my fasting window? Any other ideas/suggestions?  


I really appreciate the help!   
I'm a keto newbie, so every information you guys can provide is welcome! &lt;3  
Thank you! :)"
keto,I believe I am in ketosis now,"Current weight \~235 goal weight 160 45F 5'9""

hello i (re) started my keto journey this week. this year was a particular pain, pandemic notwithstanding but right now I am at my heaviest.

Years ago--about 1996--i had great success on the Atkins plan. at the time i needed to lose 20 pounds and I did so quite easily. I maintained that loss for about a decade then i went into a slow but steady increase until now.

also my last physical showed an A1C level at the max number for what is considered a normal range. Type 2 diabetes runs rampant in my family so i have an extra motivator here for losing and controlling my weight. my triglycerides are also high, i have gallstones, diverticular disease and moderate osteoarthritis.

being on LCHF makes me feel better almost instantly. i experienced a crap mood earlier this week for maybe a day but that mood lifted quickly. now i feel quite good. my joints don't hurt my sleep is good i don't have reflux.

BUT... my gut isn't too happy. my biggest struggle with keto after experiencing diverticulitis is the artificial sweeteners. I cannot tolerate most of them. Stevia is ok and i'm using it now but the aftertaste...ick. I tried monkfruit before and i think the one i bought was cut with erythritol so it wasn't good for me. I will have to search for a ""pure"" monkfruit I guess, if such a thing exists. If not, I now see on the market allulose. Has anyone here used it? And if any one of you has diverticular disease or IBS I appreciate any tips you can share with me to help me soothe my belly. I want to stay on this lifestyle. I do OMAD for the most part. I love how the long fasting hours (16 hours approx.) significantly calms my stomach down."
keto,"Keto Chocolate Bark, 3g Net Carbs!","https://imgur.com/a/K05gRBK

Found a great Keto desert while shopping at a local grocery store (Sprouts): Choc Zero Keto Bark. It is a 6-pack bag of keto milk chocolate bars with hazelnuts (that’s sweetened with monk fruit extract), and it definitely taste just as good as any other chocolate bar out there. Each bar is moderately sized and enough to satisfy any cravings, and it’s only 3g net carbs per bar. Personally, I like to chill mine in the fridge before consuming, but you’re free to enjoy them however you like! Definitely recommend giving it a try."
keto,I finally cracked the iced cafe mocha without using artificial sweetener!,"I'm not an artificial sweetener user, other than a little stevia, so it has been brutal not having my cafe mochas. I found a very tasty work-around this week that I had to share! 

1. Make 2 oz espresso using your favorite coffee, any flavor. I love the ""Door County"" brand from Amazon because they have a huge assortment of flavors.

2. Pour a couple tablespoons of keto chocolate chips (The ""Peoples Keto"" brand (Amazon), flavored with stevia, is sooooo good that I cannot even tell it's not a true semi-sweet chocolate chip, and I'm even more picky than a child!) into a small microwaveable bowl.

3. Pour in 1/4 cup heavy cream and stir a little.

* Play around with the quantities of chocolate chips and heavy cream and use whatever you like and can work into your daily counts.

4. Microwave 30 seconds. Don't over cook! Just cook enough to get the chocolate chips to start to melt. Take it out and stir until blended nicely like chocolate fondue.

5. In a regular size coffee cup, pour in the espresso and chocolate/cream mixture and stir.

6. Add ice.

7. Optional:  Top with Redi Whip.

ENJOY!!! ☕❤

I have only done this once and need to actively calculate the nutrition info, but this is so good that it is worth taking the time to get it right! I don't like super sweet beverages, so having the sweetness come solely from the stevia chocolate chips suits me fine! I will not endulge every day, but can work this in when I'm missing a treat."
keto,Made it to my first goal weight! SW:265 CW:214.8,"I started a year ago at 265 pounds and stayed on keto for about 6 months and lost about 45 pounds then I fell off the wagon for a while. Jumped back on this August and had to lose the 25lbs I gained back, but I am officially down 50lbs! I feel great and can notice such a huge difference in how I feel as well as my confidence going up. 

 I did keto, plus fasting. Usually OMAD and a few couple day fasts.

I had been at a stall for the last 6 weeks, but this week I went hiking every other day and did ab workouts on the off days and lost those last 8 pounds. 

Thank you to this community! I still have a ways to go, but I feel motivated every day I look at this subreddit."

keto,Frustrated with lack of nutrition education in my family,"I've had a very up and down journey with fitness and nutrition over the past few years and tried a lot of failed fad diets before figuring out what works for me- focusing on macros. On a cut, this means keeping protein high and lowering my carbs in order to reduce calories and maintain muscle. The easiest way for me to do this is through keto.

Recently I gained a lot of weight during quarantine and I've been back on the grind since the gyms reopened. I've already lost 30% of the weight I gained and I'm making excellent progress at the gym, working myself up to my working weights before shutdown. 

My parents are visiting for a few weeks for Christmas and once my mom got wind of my weight loss goals she's been preparing to commandeer my diet. She does not believe in calories or macros, only in portion control. Her goal is to get me to reduce my portions further when I am already on a very brutal cut.

I keep trying to educate her on calories and protein but she insists that she is right and I am wrong. She's never personally managed to lose weight because her method of losing weight is snacking the entire day- it doesn't matter what the snack is as long as it's small. On the other hand, several years ago I lost a lot of weight and got into incredible shape (before quarantine lol) doing what works for me.

How can I educate my mom on what I'm doing? She hates any time I bring up calorie math, macros, etc. I want to be able to eat her cooking without getting into fights about portions or the carbs she's using."

keto,Cholesterol Levels Post Weight Loss,"Thought some of you might enjoy this story.

I’ve been cyclically doing Keto since 2017. On my first cycle I did keto 5 months straight with 5-6 cheat days total, no alcohol, and lots of cardio and lifting. I went from 285 to 225 and I’m a 6’2 male with broad shoulders and was at the best shape of my life at 24. I was curious to get blood work done, so a week goes by, I get my results, and my cholesterol levels were through the roof. In big red letters above my cholesterol readings it said “obese levels of cholesterol seek consultation”. I laughed and was like “obese”? I did some research and found that when we go through these keto weight loss transitions, our fat cells release cholesterol. It’s completely normal and they level out eventually. Theres a lecture on YouTube about it I just can’t find the link. Just known if you find yourself in this position towards the end of your weight loss journey it’s completely normal!

keto,Getting over the self loathing,"I've been doing keto for a few months now to amazing results so far, but it can be hard letting go of certain behaviors of self loathing and such. I was one of those guys who spent YEARS trying out different diets, always starting the day good, ending with a binge , going to bed ashamed and saying ""I'll get it right tomorrow"". Then I jumped on Keto, and in the last few months I've lost 15 pounds. I'm starting to see it show, I feel better, and some nights I Feel great, especially at first when i was losing like half a pound a day before the plateau.

Sometimes though I go to bed and I just still have that same self loathing, its crazy. I'll go to bed thinking ""I'm doing it wrong, i have to get this right"", I still act as if I'm trapped in that hell in my mind of spending years trying to get my life together. Sometimes I have to take a deep breath and remind myself that even if I did make a mistake that day or had a cheat, that its okay, that I am still losing weight, my body is still looking better, and even when i think im over eating im really not, I rarely go above 1200 calories anymore.

It is just hard to let go of that toxic cyclical mindset of constantly saying 'tomorrow is the first day of the rest of my life, and im going to get it right'. Now I'm just actively in the getting better phase but im not sure how to handle it emotionally just because im so used to failing then getting my hopes high the next morning."

I would like to try Keto, as it is pretty similar to my current diet, however my snacks being replaced with fruits may be a problem because I know fruits have natural carbs and some sugar as well.

keto,Is your doctor supportive of keto?,"Hi friends! I’ve been enjoying the sub and want to ask for your thoughts. I’m not overweight but have been struggle with belly fat for the longest time! I tried paleo previously and could not stick to it pass the 6 months mark. I recently started keto and feel that it’s a very sustainable diet in conjunction with intermittent fasting. I have been feeling really good and am planning to stick to it. 

I just went back from my annual exam and I was told that my cholesterol levels are high. I have a history of higher cholesterol and I don’t think keto will help with this category. Also after reading a lot on cholesterol, I found that it might not be the main cause for heart disease as we once believed. My doctor is recommending a low fat high protein diet and get a test every 6 months to monitor. The dr doesn’t seem too concerned probably because of my age and weight. 

Have you talked with your doctor about being on keto? Are they supportive?"

keto,Breaking Through Plateau: To Keep Keto or Rest?,"Hey y’all. As you guys know from my previous post I have been committed to keto for several months now (basically all of quarantine). I have lost a significant amount of weight between food journaling - tracking my macros/calories; doctor prescribed medication - Phentermine; strenuous workouts - HIIT/Cardio; and the keto diet. Your tips have been WONDERFUL in my journey to losing 55lbs. 

Over the past month however I have hit a serious weight stall. I haven’t gained nor lost any weight despite the dramatic weight change from earlier. And though I am seeing a lot of new muscle definition it’s not enough of a change to warrant the weight stagnation. 

I was wondering if this would be a good time to start calorie watching instead of strictly staying keto. I am already keeping to a under 1250 calorie regiment and working out at minimum 4 times a week, with rest days being dedicated to neighborhood walks and light stretching. 

What do you think Reddit? Do your (most constructive) worst."
keto,Review of PBH Foods,"In my quest to find an adequate-tasting keto baked good, I tried three products from [PBH Foods](https://pbhfoods.com/): sesame seed bagels, cinnamon toaster pastries and pumpkin spice donuts.

Honestly, I would not repurchase. Nobody could have wanted these to be delicious more than me!! For one thing, they are made with allulose, which is the only sweetener I can stand, and for another they come in wonderful flavors.

But I could not get past the weird texture. To market these as bagels and donuts  - no. At 150 calories per (tiny) donut, I could not justify the so-so taste.

On to my new idea - homemade keto treats from Etsy! There are some tremendous bakers on there making low-carb and keto muffins and bagels. I will report back how they are!"
keto,Best way to curb appetite?,"I had been doing a pretty good job keeping my carbs down low for a bit, but then I started adding in exercising and my appetite spiked. I literally never excerised because of how awful it made me feel, but I've been able to keep it up after buying the game ringfit adventure. I try to exercise at least 3 times a week, sometimes 4 or 5, and they usually last around 45-60 minutes on average (sometimes 30min or 90 min): thats total time actually exercising and doesn't include the in-between stuff within the game.
Even if something is super low in calories, I end up eating so much. And with covid and isolation aggrevating my depression and my psychiatrist being unable to raise any of my meds, I end up turning to food to just... feel like im doing something?

What should I be eating/doing to help stop these cravings? Its been really difficult. Gum seems to kind of work for me, any recommendations?"
keto,Avocado Frozen Yogurt Bars (Keto-friendly),"These keto-friendly avocado frozen yogurt bars

dipped in dark chocolate magic shell are chock full of

healthy fats! In fact, the very short ingredients list

incorporates five out of the top 10 listed healthiest

fats on Healthline. They are: avocados (of course),

full-fat Greek yogurt, dark chocolate, coconut (in both

oil and desiccated forms), and almonds. To keep the

bars healthy, I sweetened them with stevia.

I hope that you make some in the coming hot months

and also hope they can bring in some of your votes

as these deliciously fatty froyo bars have been

entered into the Fat Challenge. Many thanks!

Avocado Frozen Yogurt Bars (Keto-friendly): Page 1

Step 1: Ingredients and Supplies

Yields 4 x 1/2 cup frozen yogurt bars

AVOCADO FROZEN YOGURT INGREDIENTS

2 ripe avocados

1 cup full-fat Greek yogurt

3/4 cup stevia (the kind that is cup-for-cup measure)

NOTE: Since every brand of stevia or sweetener can

vary greatly in potency, just add to taste, however

consider that treats tend to be less sweet when

frozen.

ANOTHER NOTE: If you are not watching your sugar

intake nor on keto, you may as well go all the way

with calorie consumption by sweetening the bars

using condensed milk. Again, sweeten to taste. The

condensed milk will yield a creamier result similar to

ice cream.

MAGIC SHELL INGREDIENTS

150 g dark chocolate, chopped

1/4 cup refined coconut oil (the kind that is solid at

room temperature; also refined means no coconut

taste!)

Chopped almonds

Desiccated coconut

SUPPLIES

Popsicle molds (each is a 1/2 cup cavity)

Large popsicle sticks

Wide, short glass that would easily fit the pops for

dipping

Avocado Frozen Yogurt Bars (Keto-friendly): Page 2

Step 2: Avocado Frozen Yogurt Bars

It couldn't be easier!

1. Place avocados, yogurt, and stevia in a blender.

2. Blend until thoroughly combined.

3. Pour into the popsicle molds.

4. Place popsicle sticks in the center of each mold.

5. Freeze 6-8 hours or overnight.

Avocado Frozen Yogurt Bars (Keto-friendly): Page 3

Step 3: Magic Shell

It's important to use hardened coconut oil to make the

magic shell. It's the hardening of the coconut oil at

room temperature that allows the chocolate to harden

almost immediately when in contact with the frozen

yogurt bars. Also note that it's best to use refined

coconut oil because the unrefined version gives off a

coconut taste (unless you do want to flavor your

chocolate with a hint of coconut).

1. Combine coconut oil and chopped dark chocolate

in a bowl.

2. Heat in microwave for one minute.

3. Mix thoroughly until smooth. If there are still

chocolate chunks, heat for another 30 seconds and

mix.

Avocado Frozen Yogurt Bars (Keto-friendly): Page 4

Step 4: Dip Dip Dip

1. Place the mold in a bowl of hot water for 10-15

seconds to release the avocado frozen yogurt bars.

2. Place the liquid magic shell in a short, wide glass

that would fit the height and width of the bars. Dip the

bars until coated.

3. Immediately sprinkle coconut and almond toppings

on the magic shell before it sets.

4. I double and even tripled dipped my bars to add

more layers of toppings.

And there you have it! Avocado frozen yogurt bars

ready for summer!

I‘ll probably use this energy to work out and I just hope I can get some sleep tonight"
keto,Adding Vegan,"Hey guys, I've been on ketosis for about 6 months after a major depression and it helped me tremendously, lower dosage of my medication since right after starting ketosis, cannot go back, this has healed my brain in ways I cannot describe.

Recently added vegan on top of that, yes I know, extremely restrictive but not that hard once you've already been on keto since you already figured out which nuts and vegetables to eat.

Everything that keto has done for me, it just accentuated it; it's a really great feeling of lightness and yes, still am in ketotis.

Just wanted to let you know, next time I'll post before and after pictures of my beautiful Viking body lol"
keto,Zucchini allergy- what can I do?,"I’m getting ready to start my keto journey in a couple days.

I am allergic (I mean like breaking out in hives allergic). Are cucumbers a good choice? Do they make the recipe turn out any different? Please give me your suggestions. Thanks!"

keto,Carb tolerance proved by losing weight,"Hi,

I'm female 42yo, sw 200, cw 178, gw 160, started September 8th 2020.

Started with 20 net carbs, went down to 15 net after some insulin crashes. 

Had some trouble with my period a few weeks later, then read about progesterone building foods, adjusted to 30 net carbs in second half of cycle, and now I'm losing more daily weight than ever in the past 3 months! It's so great! 


That means my personal carb tolerance is not exceeded with the 30 net, right? Cause, it's working! I don't do exercise and I'm mostly sedentary apart from some walking. I think I might be at least partially fat adapted. 

Keto rocks! I put on a pair of pants today that's been in my closet forever with the tag still attached. I couldn't even get my legs in there earlier this year."

keto,Carbs from Veggies You Cook but Don't Eat?,"Sorry if this has been asked a thousand times, but I couldn't find anything about it on here (although I wasn't really sure what to search either). Anyway, I've been looking at some short rib recipes, and I have two similar questions. 

One recipe braises the ribs in stock with celery, onions, and carrots then reduce it to a sauce when you're done. I know carrots are usually off limits, but here you strain out the veggies and throw them away. Will those carrots add enough carbs to the sauce to worry about?

The second recipe is a Korean-style short rib which is marinated in a combination of soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar. But you wash off all of the marinade and just use a tablespoon or two to flavor the sauce. Is a spoonful of sugar in a marinade that you wash off enough to throw me out of ketosis, or should I just bite the bullet and buy some alternative sweetener?"
keto,Losing weight slowly?,"I began keto on 10/1. SW 275lbs. 16/8 IF.

No physical activity besides walking my dog a few times a day. 

My diet consists primarily of eggs, cheese, bacon, leafy greens, chicken, beef, broccoli and cauliflower. Oh and some nuts here and there for snacking. I will eat the Lenny and Larry’s keto cookies as a treat when I have a sweet tooth or whip up some chocolate keto mousse every other week or so. I drink seltzer, water, coffee with heavy cream and vanilla extract... 

I have lost 15lbs. I am proud of my progress but I cannot help but feel that I should be a little bit further along by now. Am I being too hard on myself? Is there something I’m not doing right? Any tips?

keto,Carb Macro questions,"Hi everyone!

I’m new to this subreddit and was wondering about the amount of carb intakes you would need. I heard that you need around 45%-65% of your total calorie intake. I’m trying to get shredded, so I have mine at 45% of total caloric intake. Yesterday I didn’t even hit 45%. Will that be bad for me? I balance all other macros and still hit the intake caloric maintenance, but I’m afraid my body will start eating at my muscles.

If anyone can provide any insights, that would be awesome!!

(I understand that there are some information in the FAQ but I wanted to be a little bit specific of the muscle growth and loss)

keto,Keto with Gout,"I've heard that Keto is and isn't good for people with Gout.

I've used Keto before and then transititoned to PSMF and it was very successful where I was eating a lot of chicken (leg, thigh or breast) everyday, it was the best I've ever felt until 2 years ago I started getting my pain in my knee. A few months later, I got married and got carried away with the amount of wedding cake I had, within 2 weeks, I had pain in my big toe and I've never managed to fully recover from both.  


I want to try Keto again but not sure if this would help (apart from for losing weight).

keto,How to transition off of keto?,"After numerous attempts to start only to give in to cravings, I finally have been on keto since May (I actually started on my birthday, figured I owed it to myself.)

I unfortunately didn't weigh myself at the start, but I was around 250 lbs at the time, and I'm now 180, which seems to be around where my ""natural"" weight is (6'0 male, puts my BMI on the higher end of healthy)

I figure now's probably a good time to transition off of it, especially since it's expensive to maintain, but the thought of eating carbs again kinda scares me a bit; I don't want to rebound and gain the weight back."
keto,Back to losing weight after stalling for 20 days,"I was losing weight fast when i started this keto journey, yet somehow I stopped, I never cheated on my diet so I was concerned that I didn't lose any weight for 20 straight days. 
During the first week I fasted, walked a lot like 5 km every day, still no results and work became a bit too hard to deal with so I stopped walking and stopped fasting. 

Cool thing about this diet that if you pig out on keto meals you don't gain the weight back that easily. Which was perfect everytime i felt bad I ate which is a symptom of deeper issues with stress management.

Last week I started watching for carb creep in my diet and turns out yes, I'm getting myself out of ketosis by eating certain things either too much or thinking they were keto friendly when they weren't. (Internationally small serving sizes and what not) 
I didn't walk as much and never fasted still  i lost 1 kg these past 3 days... 

No nutrient system is this forgiving or this fun... I hope that you don't give up hope if you stall...
Watch for carb creep (watch the carb addiction doc for more information about carb creep) and don't over stress about weight buy a measuring tape it's way more reliable, i recorded my measurements half way through keto, I'll post a comparison when i achive my first milestone (3kg to go)"

keto,Confused,"Hello fellow ketoers 

Just looking for some advice. 

I started Keto on 1st Sept 2020 and have steadily lost weight using the 5%carbs 20% protein 75%Fat macros method. 

Then I joined reddit and read FAQ and loads of posts about how I should calculate macros into grams and up my protein to my body's needs. Also not to worry about Fat as much 

So I used the calculator and my macros worked out as 100g protein, 95g fat, 1331 calories. 

Since using these measures for the past 3 weeks, I haven't lost any weight. 

I know the issue with water weight/hormones and also know weightloss is not linear but I didn't expect to plateau for 3 weeks 

I also do 20/4 IF everyday. 

Any ideas if I totally messed up my macros or if its something else?"

keto,Weight loss stalled for 4 weeks - please help!,"Hello! I have been on keto for roughly 3 months. My IBS has cleared up almost completely, I rarely feel hungry, and overall feel pretty great! I have also lost approximately 15 pounds, but I haven't lost anything in almost a month now. I have only cheated once in that time and I've been very diligent in staying between 1200-1700 calories and under 20 net carbs a day. I've cut out virtually all artificial sweeteners, eat fiber-rich veggies every day (while still staying within my macros), cut out most processed foods, and only eat berries once or twice a week trying to bust this plateau and get the scale moving again. I am not exercising at this point, but definitely exploring that as an option as well. I am 33 years old, female, and work a largely sedentary desk job. Start weight was about 268 pounds, and I'm currently sitting at 252 pounds since the beginning of November (only gaining or losing the same pound or two every week.)

I did the keto diet about 5 years ago and I lost more weight faster and I wasn't NEARLY as diligent and cheated all the time. I don't know what's going on! I also read in the FAQ that having cheat days ""can also help physically by busting a plateau, boosting your metabolism, and resetting leptin (the hunger/satiety hormone)"". Can anyone elaborate on this please? Is my diligence and lack of cheat days causing me to stall? Should I consider cheating more often?

Thank you in advance!! :)"

keto,Here I go again!,"10 years ago I stepped on a scale and saw that I had went from around 220 in high school to less than 3 years later 330+ lbs. I was so sad when I saw that number pop up that I knew I had to do something but had no idea where to start. I remember googling ""how to lose weight fast"" and found a popular article saying ""lower calories, eat protein, do cardio"", so I dove right in. over the next few years I ate super small amounts and worked my butt off on a stationary bike then moved to the insanity workout videos. 

I got all the way down to 240 but constantly felt absolutely horrible. I ended up getting married and had a kid and got to around 270 after a year or two and then I found this subreddit through a progress pics post. I did tons of research and asked tons of questions and eventually started up. I ended up getting down to 215 in the matter of 3 or 4 months with very little working out and I was floored. I wasn't hungry all the time, I didn't feel like I killed myself to get there. It just worked. the one thing I never experienced that so many here seem to though was the cravings for sugar going away. I always looked at friends or family eating sweets or my kryptonite, potatoes with longing eyes and the holidays were right around the corner. 

Needless to say I broke my diet that holiday season. I didn't gain a ton of weight but I beat myself up about it. ever since this point around 5 years ago I have yoyo'd between 240 and 260 up until this past year. my wife got pregnant with twins and shortly after giving birth to them covid hit and I worked from home for months. This along with horrible decisions, led me to seeing my weight on the scale hitting 300+ for the first time in a decade, over the past 5 months since returning to work and everything I still didn't do anything about it until this Monday evening I fired up the computer and looked at old progress picture of myself and popped in this sub and said something has to change. 

The next day I started Keto over for what feels like the millionth time, but it feels different this time. I remember how well it worked for me in the past and I did frequently use it to drop weight fast before a vacation or something. But I have never just jumped in with full commitment apart from the very first time I did it and I gave in after such a short time. I want to see where this takes me long term. My wife and family are very supportive and I just wanted to post this to motivate myself and to give it some accountability. 

So far on the 3rd day and I definitely am craving my sugary soda's and potatoes but i'm holding strong. my biggest problem right now tends to be sides to eat. i'm not a big salad fan, I've ate more cheesy broccoli and mashed cauliflower in the last 6 years than I can recall. if anyone wants to throw me some of their go to sides to make and to prep I would really appreciate it!"

My question is, should I be eating more calories even though I'm not hungry? Before or after the workout? I do feel weaker during the workout but I dont know if that is due to keto. Maybe I should just not subtract exercise from my net calories? I hit my protein macro daily and restrict fats as much as possible.

I think another mistake I made was slamming so much gatorade/powerade.

keto,Weight loss custom KETO Diet,"**Weight loss custom KETO Diet**

**The Benefits of a Ketogenic Diet** 

The Ketogenic diet refers to a form of dieting where high fats, adequate protein and low carbs are consumed. Its aim is to deplete the body's glycogen reserves so that it relies on fat and protein for energy. The body then undergoes ketosis, which is a metabolic state in which your liver produces a high number of ketones as an alternative fuel source for the brain. This form of dieting is quite popular, with dozens of pictures showing before and after results circulating all over social media. These are some benefits of the keto diet and[how it may help in achieving your goals.](https://ketodiet5.weebly.com/)

**Weight Loss** 

Several studies have shown that people on a high fat, low carb diet burn fat at a faster rate than those with a high carb, low fat diet. This is primarily because lower insulin levels caused by the low carb diet (keto), help to remove excess water from the body. During ketosis, you experience reduced levels of hunger, which can be extremely beneficial in controlling caloric intake, promoting overall weight loss. It has been noted that low carb diets are also effective in reducing visceral fat, primarily stored in the abdominal cavity.  

**Mental Performance** 

The ketones produced from a low carb diet are a much more efficient source of energy than glucose. Studies have indicated that they can improve cognitive impairment and even help with diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The high-fat diet helps to support the balance of essential omega 3s and omega 6s which are vital for optimal brain function. Additionally, ketosis is able to boost mitochondria production and adenosine triphosphate within the brain's memory cells, thereby [improving mental performance and clarity.](https://ketodiet5.weebly.com/)

**Reduced risk of Chronic Disease** 

A ketogenic diet can boost the body's defense against a variety of conditions. By reducing inflammation, and improving mitochondrial function, it can help to mitigate the risk of developing several chronic diseases. Cancer cells typically possess abnormal mitochondria, which need an increased supply of glycogen. Ketosis allows for normal cells to be fed while starving the cancer cells, as they are unable to utilize the ketones for energy because of their dysfunctional mitochondria.  

**Improved Blood Pressure** 

High blood pressure significantly increases the risk of several diseases and is a leading cause of deaths worldwide. A low-carb diet has been proven to be more effective than a low-fat diet in reducing blood pressure. In fact, some claim that it is just as effective as taking pills. This combined with the weight loss derived from a ketogenic diet, is sure to vastly improve cardiovascular health and function.  

It has been proven by numerous studies in the realm of nutrition science, that this form of dieting can have a very positive impact on your overall health and bodily function. As long as you can find a way to maintain the discipline, the rewards are abundant. For those that have not been able to gain many results from traditional methods, the keto approach is definitely something worth considering.

keto,4 Month check-in,"Good Morning All

Firstly, thank you to everyone in this sub. You guys are an amazing source of inspiration, encouragement and advice. I've been on keto before but struggled to stay on longer than 2 months and to find the right information but since I joined this sub, this time round Keto has been a breeze. You guys are awesome! 

I've been on Keto for 4 months exactly today. I started at 157.7Kg (348lbs) and as of today I am weighing in at 135.9Kg (299lbs)! My goal was to be under 300lbs within 4 months and I've made it to the day :)

For those interested in my diet, I am doing keto with mostly OMAD (sometimes 20:4) IF during the week and switch to 16:8 on the weekends. I keep below 1500 calories and I drink a lot of water but do have the occasional coke zero 2-3 times a week. I do love my food so I make the most of my meals, initially I ate a lot of eggs but lately have cut that out and have mostly a healthy portion of meat (however I'm wishing for it) and a bit of veggies or something on the side. 

Mostly, I'll throw some meat on the grill or i'll pan fry some chicken breast or belly pork. Sometimes I'll make a beef or mince curry and have that with Shiritaki Noodles, keto bread or keto wraps/roti. 

For a snack I make my own Pork Skins/Crackling and those are awesome. Almost like eating a packet of crisps, otherwise I snack on biltong/jerky but snacks happen very rarely. 

I don't exercise as I work long hourse in front of a computer all day but would like to make a point of getting more active soon. 

Twice that I've gone into a plateau, I did a 48hr fast and that quickly got me dropping the weight again. I'm fitting into clothes I haven't worn in over 2 years. 

If you have any questions or advice please feel free to jump into the comments! Thanks again everyone."

keto,"My weight loss on keto has stalled. Should I incorporate exercise? Fellow keto’ers, I need your help!","I’ve been doing keto for 4 weeks now, and it’s been going well! I was at 169 and down to 162. I’m pretty active and walk with my dog everyday. But the last two weeks, it seems like my weight loss has stalled. I’ve been consistently at 162-163. I lost most of my weight the first two weeks. I track my macros regularly as well as I can. I’d love to start lifting weights and do more vigorous exercises but am unsure about it it’s the right time to start? I think it could help me break this weight-loss pause. I’ve heard varying opinions about exercise on keto. I’ve heard not to do weight lifting etc since my carbs are lower. Thoughts on this?"
keto,Do you stick to keto after you've reached your GW?,"I'm not on that point of decision yet, but just wondering. What's you guy's strategy to maintain your GW and stay healthy after you've completed the weightloss phase? Do you stick to strict keto or are you introducing some carbs in a moderate way? I mean I am fine with no carbs for an extended period of time but never eating things like bread again seems way off my track. 

I've started a running scheme and plan to complete it at the time I am to reach my GW. If I introduce regular exercise in my life (like running) and don't touch added sugars, how bad would it be to eat some more carbs than I do right now? 

Thanks for sharing your thoughts and experiences. This sub has been a great help for me so far."
keto,Anyone have Batman senses?,"I can’t help but notice the fact that my ears are highly sensitive now it might be from the weight loss and being in ketosis but man do I hear everything! It’s very overwhelming at time especially in crowded places, a lot of sounds tend to annoy the shit outta me I find my self having to leave the room at times to chill out!"
keto,White colored keto foods following teeth whitening?,"I’m getting my teeth whitened tomorrow, and I’m supposed to eat a “white diet” for 48 hours after, meaning foods that won’t stain, but I can’t think of many keto foods that fit the bill. Any suggestions?"
keto,Workout before carbs?,"So, I've been on keto for over a year, and I can eat carbs once in a while (in larger quantities) without getting all sorts of problems, except it does influence weight loss a few days after.  
I swimm 2-3 times a week, and on saturday I am hosting a christmas event, and will be eating quite a lot of carbs.  
So I was wondering, if it would be of particular benefit to schedule a swimm (1 hour non-stop) a couple of hours before the carb-loaden feast :) ?  


I think I've heard that after a workout carbs will be soaked up fast by the muscles, but is that a thing?  
Just wondering, no biggie."
keto,Bulletproof Products,"Can anyone share experiences they’ve had with bulletproof chocolate protein? I bought it assuming it would be fine, since keto basically is the bulletproof brand.

The packaging says 7g net carbs per serving, but when I emailed the rep they said they use some kind of macro carbohydrate that your body doesn’t process like sugar...I am suspicious about this science. 

Before I get kicked out of ketosis, I was wondering if anyone here had experience with their products."
keto,Losing weight is hard on a low base,"I am a 1.6m (5ft3) female. I have controlled my weight at about 111pounds (50.5kg), my method was intermittent fasting which worked for me for more than a year. My intermittent fasting was the dirty kind - full of carbs and my favorite was big bowels of rice drenched with gravy. But I maintained my weight because commuting to and from work kept me standing and walking and was really a great form of exercise, I realise in retrospect. And bingeing within a small time effect did help to digest away the food.

Came Covid and my form of dirty intermittent fasting stopped working. I became sedentary from work-from-home and the carbs took their toll. My weight soared to 53kg (117pounds). This may not sound like much but remember I'm short at 1.6m (5ft3). My hips and thighs were turning squarish in the mirror and my upper arms were swelling. I was horrified.

I started to crash diet in a disorganised way for a few days but ended up cold, weak and tired. Then I recalled reading/being told about a diet where one can always feel full, satiated and energised. I embarked on keto on 10 Oct 2020.

From 53kg (117pounds), I dropped back to 50.5kg (111pounds). The initial loss of 2kg or so came quick and easy in two weeks.

The problem is the plateau. I tested my urine frequently, every time I'm in ketosis. But the ketosis is not translating into further weight loss. I'm stagnating. I'm really aiming for 48kg (106pounds) but it is challenging. (Again, I'm short, so  48kg is not anorexia for me)

My choice of keto foods is strict, but my weight is stuck. That is when I decide to up the ante by doing macro counting. It is when I started macro counting when I realised that my dirty keto (which involves food choice but no counting) may be the reason why my ketosis is not converting in the weight loss.

I am about 1 week into macro counting. I set the bar at 10% below my height-weight range to ensure calorie deficit. On average, now I'm consuming about 60-70% of the calories (as well as protein/fat/net carb) of a woman my height-weight. I feel full and satiated everyday because I'm scientific about my food choice.

Yes, I am starting to lose weight, but not dramatically, only a couple of hundreds grams here and there, and sometimes it comes back.

It simply is not a smooth ride at all, but an arduous journey.

I hope it works."
keto,Keto Slump?,"I’ve been on Keto for the past couple weeks. Down 23lbs. My diet hasn’t changed I’ve been strict in keeping track of carb, fats and protein intake. But the past week I haven’t lost any weight. I’ve been consistently losing weight since I started but I’m stuck in this point of not losing any weight. Is this normal?"
keto,Almost able to knit a blanket with my hair 😂,"Hey everyone!

Sorry this may be a longish post but I'd rather give too much info - any advice or anecdotal information will be appreciated!

So I've done keto for 90 days. At times strict and other times moderate. Slow and steady weight loss (24 pounds / 11kg).

I typically do about 1200 cal a day sometimes up to 1400 depending. I dont fast. I have loads of salad and veg a day.

Supplements I take is collagen, omega 3, probiotics. Up until a week or two ago I was having a higher dose of collagen, zinc, BHBs and magnesium. I stopped just because I haven't bought new containers of them just yet.

But in the last week or so (not related to decrease in supplements it's just coincidental) my hair has been falling out like crazy.

The last time this happened I was in first year uni and not getting the right nutrition due to bad student lifestyle. But now I'm really strict on making sure I get nutrition and eat well even if it means my carbs go a lil over (from veggies and salad).

Has anyone had similar? Did you take supplements or perhaps find your diet lacking in certain areas? Not blaming keto at all (I love it) I'm obviously being a nana about something. 

TIA! x"
keto,"Keto since Aug, finally found my sweet spot","I started keto in late Aug and never really found that sweet spot. I didn't have the massive losses a lot of people report and decided I had to just accept that I'm a middle-aged woman and a pound or so a week was all I could expect, even in the honeymoon period. Canadian Thanksgiving came and went and the loss slowed even more, but I thought that was to be expected - after all, the initial water weight fell off (slowly, but still), and I was tracking and sticking pretty close to my macros - adjusting as the day went on to try to meet them as closely as possible. Middle-aged woman, remember?

I tried dropping artificial sweeteners. I stopped doing cream&amp;butter in my coffee in the mornings, but then I was starving by lunch so that's back in with a tsp of sugar-free syrup because coffee tastes like shit). 

In the last 2 weeks, I've committed to limiting snacking -  no longer trying to top up my protein with cheese, meat, and nuts. (some of you see where this is going). And I embraced my morning coffee/tea with cream (and maybe butter some days). And I've said a firm no to treats, instead of ""a bite won't hurt."" When I started to boredom/stress eat, I stopped myself and those snack foods did not get put in the pantry again (so long quest bars).

I lost 5lbs last week and that's continuing into this week. And my appetite is drastically reduced. I eat my meals and unless stress hits, I don't even think about eating again in between. I am slowly eating that bag of frozen cherries I can't bring myself to toss - 8 cherries at a time which is both ridiculous and delicious.

I'm kinda concerned that maybe I'm not getting enough calories in the day ( stopped tracking to avoid trying to add macros), but I'm focusing on a variety of meats/fish/poultry/oils/butter/leafy greens with some pork rinds, cheese, and cream in limited amounts. And running 3x a week. I don't know how long this will last, but I don't want to be THAT keto person in real life so I had to share my excitement somewhere. It took a while, but I FINALLY got it working for me."

keto,Does LDL cholesterol increase or decrease while doing Keto and is it a concern or problem?,"Hello everyone, I’m asking this since I am concerned about high cholesterol.

keto,Keto and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu performance,"Had been on strict Keto diet (~20 net carbs/day) since mid July, so about 4.5 months. Wasn’t large to begin with, but leaned out and also have gained muscle and getting a real 6 pack for the first time ever. Feels great mentally, too. Endurance training was always easy on keto, could basically run as many miles as I wanted. 

Started training BJJ in September. I’ve been getting better don’t get me wrong. Recently decided to try a keto break because of Thanksgiving, and the first two days back to BJJ and I’m clearly doing a lot better and a lot of it is strength related, ie pushing people off of me, etc. 

I think this must have to do with muscle glycogen? Shouldn’t 4 months be enough to be “keto adapted”, or will eating carbohydrates always lead to better performance for this kind of activity? Trying to come up with a diet to maximize lifestyle and also BJJ performance."

keto,Sneaky veggies,"Hi guys!

So my problem is... I am autistic and have bad sensory responses to most vegetables. I understand that a lot of people want to call me childish and tell me to grow up for that, and trust me, I’ve tried. 

It is a special kind of hell for me to eat most veggies, especially lots of the ones like leafy greens that come with keto, broccoli, avocado. I can put some spinach in my omelets, but I stop there. Because I am autistic eating bad textures is quite literally painful for me sometimes and results in crying/throwing up. 

Yes, it is that severe. No, I cannot afford a nutritionist or special doc to help me with this, I am already wrestling with other medical things. And I do feel stupid for it. It seems like now all of the veggies I used to eat have been cut out of my diet because they’re too high carb, so I’m not getting any of those. 

So because it’s hard to just shove them in my face hole, how do you guys sneak veggies into your food? What do you guys think I could do to be better at getting over this? 

Thankfully the rest of the keto part is not too hard for me. 
Thanks and pls be kind. 💕"

I saw an IG post yesterday with a woman who had amazing results with keto and IF and just wanted to get more opinions.

keto,A question that I can’t figure out and maybe YOU can,"Guys I need help with something and after a week going solo trying to figure it out, I’m still none the wiser. 

So staying in ketosis and the amount of carbs one can eat varies for every said individual? As it’s 4 calories per gram of carb does that mean if I, let’s say consume 20 grams of carbs which equates to 80 calories that I have to burn 80 calories through activity to get back into ketosis? Now let’s increase carb content to 50g. Does that mean I need to burn (50x4) 200 calories through activity to return to ketosis? Am I correct in understanding it this way? If so, THEORETICALLY the threshold could be even greater, say 100g etc as long as you’re extremely active? Or is my understanding of ketosis, which is based purely on layman’s logic and rational, utterly false?

Thanks for your help. I’m going to love reading people’s thoughts on this."
keto,Do we need more omega-3’s than regular people?,I have increased my daily intake to 8g and I feel better.  It kinda makes sense because our bodies use much more fat than the average person.

keto,Net carbs vs. total carbs,"Hey all,

my stats: 20-24g carbs, 130g fats, 135g protein. SW: 125kg (275lbs), CW: 118,8kg (262lbs), GW: 90kg (200lbs). Height 1,79m (I think 5'10), male, 31 years old.

I'm doing keto again since 15 days now and I dropped about 13 lbs. I know that probably most of it is water weight and I'm not too worried about that. I just keep on doing keto and not worrying too much about the weight. I weigh myself daily and forget about it but I log it because I am a data freak.

I did keto 2 years ago as well and dropped something like 15kg (33lbs) in \~5-6 months so I kind of know the drill with staying below 20g of carbs, eating protein and fats, ect. In the last days I kind of struggle hitting my protein goal but I've ordered a neutral protein powder which I can mix into my coffee or something else (neutral because I am also resetting my taste buds so therefore no artificial sweeteners although I kind of miss some of the sodas). Great! I do not have any cravings except for only about 1-2 seconds SOMETIMES. I do not feel hungry as I did before keto and this is just awesome. I guess I am doing everything correct.

Now I have been lurking in this sub for a long time and since I started my journey again I check for new posts for motivation and tips &amp; tricks daily. Keep up the good work by the way, it really helps but of course you already know that ;-)

On some posts I saw some guys/gals mention Dr. Cywes on YouTube. I watched some of his content, including ""Understanding carb addiction"", ""Vulnerability to addictive behavior"" and just some minutes ago ""Why keto/carnivore diets fail"" and ""Net carbs vs total carbs"". In ""net carbs vs. total carbs"" he mentions that we should only look at total carbs instead of net carbs because net carbs are cracking us up and keep us staying ""addicted"" to carbs with look-alike products which are just without the high amounts of carbs. He also says that we shouldn't care about macros at all and eat just normally with a yes/no philosophy for carbs. He says we should know the total amounts of carbs each food has and make our decisions based on that and remove those out of the picture.

What do you think about that ? I see lots of people here talking about you only have to count net carbs, watch your macros, protein is a goal to extend, fat is a lever and I get that! For me it makes total sense. How is this compared to the approach of Dr. Cywes?

Am I just overlooking things here?

Thanks for your discussions in advance!"
keto,Is there a difference in weight loss with lifting weights during keto vs not?,"Hey guys,

I started keto the last week in October, beginning  at 251 pounds, now it is December 1st and I am staying around 240ish pounds for the past two weeks or so.  Weight loss has definitely slowed, however I know it is never linear, and that the first couple weeks are usually much faster than normally.   I am hitting my protein goal of about 135 grams a day every single day and am eating strictly keto friendly food. 

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest change in habits in these past two weeks is that I have been weight lifting and working out a lot more, about 4-5 times a week.  I just am not educated on what weight lifting does for weight loss.  Is my stall because of my diet, or could it be a result of my working out?  I guess I care  more about changing my body composition than just seeing a number on a scale go down, so I am not terribly worried because I feel good, and I think I look like I'm slimming down some.  

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any experience with weight lifting on keto's effect on the weight loss I would really really appreciate some insight.  Also, if anyone has any tips on lifting on keto or just this process i would truly appreciate it.  I'm super thankful for this subreddit, you all are all doing a lot for people trying to make their life better.  Being one of those people, I truly thank those of you who motivate and educate."

It says it has resistant tapioca starch, and from what I've seen, resistant starches are hit or miss so this could be very much just be straight carbs I'm eating? It hasn't stopped my weight loss, but it has slowed it down, but honestly I think that's just because of the extra butter I'm consuming with it lol. I might just cut it out because of this too.

Also side note. Looking from the macros and calories they seem to add up, 1g fat, 1g net carb, 2g protein for 30 calories. Am I misunderstanding how the calories are adding up? Where are the extra carbs coming from that would cause a spike? Are they misleading in the calories?

Thanks!"
keto,Keto with no gallbladder?,"Hi all, I’m contemplating keto to help with Candida and insulin resistance. The only issue is that I have no gallbladder. I can handle large amounts of fat but not for the first meal of the day, it goes right through me. My limit is prob somewhere around 20 grams before my body rejects it. 

To those who do keto with no gallbladder, what do you do?"
keto,Struggling to get back to it,"Hi all,
I don’t understand myself some times. I lost 21Lb from Aug - sept this year and loved what I was doing.
Then for some reason I just gave up. I reached for those sweet foods again. As a result I’ve put on half a stone and feel rubbish. 
I tell myself every night that tomorrow is a new day and I get to mid afternoon and just boom! Break it again.

Has anyone had this problem.i want to get back to where I was so I look good for Christmas but my head is really fighting this.

keto,How I lost 30KG with keto,"Hello My Fellow Ketones 

6 months  ago I was weighing about 90kg and struggling to take off the weight . It all happened because I was feeling depressed and I could only take confort by eating. As time went on I realised I was putting on weight and couldn’t fit into my clothes anymore. So I decided to follow all kinds of diets I could find, thinking is going to work and reduce the fat in my body ,but instead I was gaining more than losing. So I went to do my own research about the best weight loss and diet that could work with my body . I came a cross a Custom Keto Diet plan where it helped me to understand how it works and learned to prepared delicious 😋 healthy meals including my favourite desserts. Anyway I followed that plan each day and from the first week I started noticing a difference in my body and overall health. Long story short , thanks to this custom keto diet plan I was able to 30KG (67lbs) and I’m happier and feel great and more energetic to do all the things I love . I hope this inspires..you...."
keto,Burger sauces,I was cooking a burger last night and wanted to spice it up so I thought it would be a good idea to add apple cider vinegar in a mayo based sauce. I combined leftover bacon grease mayo apple cider vinegar red pepper and cayenne pepper. I was wondering if there are any good keto burger sauces to use or if there is any way to make the sauce better?
keto,TL;DR: Is 40-45g of carbs too much?,"Hey all!

I posted this in the new questions thread but seeing as I'm late to it I'm afraid the question might get buried!

REALLY dumb question but here goes:

I started Keto on Friday last week as per my personal trainer's suggestion.

I eat 3 meals.

Breakfast - 4/5 eggs with half a cup of raspberries, half a cup of Greek yogurt (2%) - one cup or more of veggies

Lunch and supper - 250g of meats - with one cup or more of veggies

Snacks - One full avocado (I don't snack much anyways).

**So here's my question, I entered all my meals into MyFitnessPal, and it states that my carb intake for the day is about 40g. Is that too much? Shouldn't it be less than 20g?**

I also work out heavily 6 times a week as I am an athlete. Goal of this diet for me is to cut for competitions.

Thanks in advance! I'm just paranoid I'm just following this plan but screwing up without even knowing,"
keto,I'm Guilty And I'm Really Regretting It..,"Just Venting:

Please don't look down on me. I cheated heavily for 2 days on Thanksgiving. I went on a bender. Half a tray of mac-n-cheese, rolls, Choco Tacos, pie, the whole nine yards. It was really not worth it and I will certainly not be doing it again. I feel like absolute crud. physically, mentally, and emotionally. I also started a new job in Keto-Flu, and now I feel like everything they tell me is going in one ear and out the other. I can't focus. I really chose a bad time to do this. Not that any time is a good time to cheat. It's just that the Keto flu is really kickin' my ""A"" right about now. I made so much progress too. So, take it from me, and don't cheat. It's not worth it."
keto,Frozen strawberries as a substitute for popsicles,"I was soo craving ice cream tonight... Went to the supermarket to check but they don't have anything below 24g of carbs per 100g.

Instead, I discovered they have frozen strawberries, and they're really cheap. I got it as a last resort to try to make sorbet - but turns out it's absolutely delicious without blending! It's just like eating a popsicle but with a better texture, and two berries was enough to satisfy the ice cream craving - with 1.5g carbs 🍓

So I just had to share, hopefully it can help those like me who aren't from the US and don't have any stores that carry keto or low carb ice cream.

Please add your own ""improve adapt overcome"" tips if you have any 😊"
keto,Favorite Keto Morning,"I know there are many posts about keto coffee... but here’s mine. I struggle to NOT spend money at coffee shops. I get Americanos but it still gets spendy. My favorite morning Is curled up on the couch with a cup for keto joe. 
I make coffee and pour into a blender. I add the fallowing: grass fed salted butter (2pats) heavy cream (about 4 tbls) a splash of sugar free vanilla(occasionally, im not a fan of sweet coffee) a dash of Cinnamon, and two scoops of collagen peptides.  Blend that into a frothy, filling coffee. 
The peptides blend perfectly! I get protein from that source. I’m terrible about eating enough protein. I also use I unrefined coconut oil when I have it, but I’m out... 
Let me know if there are anything’s you like to add to your morning cup that I didn’t mention. I’m always looking for new ideas!"

Do you guys know about those products, or have suggestions on similar things?"

4 Eggs

There was supposed to be some celery for fibre but I forgot to buy it.

Long time lurker, first time progress poster and after all this time, I wanted to share!  I started keto in late August 2019 and it changed my life! Thank you to this community for your insight and inspiration! Y'all rock! 

Here's what helped me along the way:

keto,Meal review? Help!,"Hi everyone,

Just an intro about me: 29F, 5’7, SW 231/CW 215/GW 170
 
I calculated my TDEE as 2000 cals a day, and when I started a month and a half ago I decided to do 1200 calories a day but I realised after a check up with my doctor yesterday that it’s far too little so I’m upping to 1500. The main general rule I have been following is to stay under 20g of carbs. 

Where I have decided to add the extra calories is in my breakfast which you will see below. I wanted to ask everyone if I’m doing the right type of meals here and if I’m spoiling myself in any way? This isn’t as fun as being a carb addict (kidding) but I don’t wanna be working so hard to realise I’ve been messing myself up!

keto,6 month face gains - 71 lbs down,"So I did post not too long ago after hitting TWOTOPIA....but today marks a full 6 months of full bore Keto and I'm happy with what I've achieved so far (I know blowing my own trumpet is very unbecoming, sorry)

To be honest I was supposed to start January first and I did....but 2020 had other plans I guess, and I'm sure that's something that is echoed with many of us!

But I decided to get my act together on June 1st, and knuckle down and see what I could do.

I started at 367, and today I am sat at 296. It's a long way to go still, but I know that I'm in this for the long haul for sure.

Meal wise, OMAD, 20:4 or 16:8...I just see how I'm feeling each day!

I was in a groove of some form of protein and some veg or salad, got in to sous vide as it's a totally hands off method of fool proof cooking.

My wife has joined me now, and so I am trying to make more effort with cooking meals to keep her motivated.

I am regularly reviewing my macros, and running a caloric deficit of 30% which is manageable without feeling like I'm on a diet.

I am baking with yeast, making awesome rolls and bread, having fun in the kitchen whilst staying keto..haven't felt the need to carb up, not once even with 3 carb filled kids in the house!

I even did a literal couch to 5k last week when I decided to hop on the treadmill for the first time in forever, and started jogging.....and 45 mins later finished a 5k....not great....but way more impressive than I had thought I was capable of

I'm thankful every day that I hopped back on the wagon. This time there's nothing that's going to unseat me!

keto,NSV: I had a shirt actually fit without stretching it,"So - I got this shirt a couple years ago as a Christmas gift. It's definitely not one of my favorites, I wouldn't wear it often, even if it fit... but it was a men's medium, and cut hipster-small... so I would either have to stretch the shirt out and ruin the design to fit around not only my chesticles, but my entire torso.  To give you the best visual: just throw a navy blue shirt with a yin yang design with an acoustic guitar on one side and an electric guitar on the other on Bib, who happens to also have boobs.

I decided today ""ah, what the hell"" and was prepared to start stretching it out. I just pulled it over my head and put it on, thinking that would let me know where to start... but I didn't have to do ANY stretching at all! 

Definitely not the sexiest NSV, but you know what?  I'll take it. I'd love to say ""I HOPE IT INSPIRES SOMEONE ELSE TODAY"" - but I'll settle for ""I hope someone just reads it, smiles, nods, and knows those feels."""

keto,NSV: I fit into a dress I didn't even expect to be close to fitting into for 4 more months.,"I started lazy keto over a year ago, and with a break up and 2020 threatening my business I had more than a few falls from keto grace. But, recently I added in intermittent fasting and it's made a huge difference.

Last night, my seamstress was looking over a few dresses I needed altered and she asked me about one that she lengthened and asked when I was going to wear it. Last time I put it on for her to measure it was a good 4 inches from even zipping and that was maybe 2 months ago. I put it on to show her how far it was from fitting (like I was laughing and saying maybe I'd never get to wear it) and it zipped. I didn't realise how much volume I had lost. We had to talk about taking in a few dresses come spring because they're already getting too big. 

I just needed to tell someone because my friends are tired of getting selfies of me in random clothes going ""it fits!"""

keto,Keto Bulk Questions,"Hello all I am looking for advice on what may be more advanced Keto diet strategies. Specifically has anyone been able to successfully bulk or maintain weight (while still cutting fat) on their diets. I am 6’7” y’all any given day I fluctuate between 265 and 280 depending on hydration and food consumption so I will just say 275 pounds. Fairly athletic build and proportionate but I would like to change the composition of that weight as well as transfer some from lower half to upper half. At the end of the day bulking is simply a calories game  that being said.

Who maintains or bulked on keto?
What strategies do you use?
Do you find it more difficult then cutting?
Do you get those extra calories from fat sources or let’s say a lean protein? 
Can you overdue it on fat intake and simply have more than your body needs to burn resulting in storage?

I have recently been awoken to the benefits of keto and do have a history of tough and rigorous dieting. Would like to still cut fat and am comfortable with my current weight. Any stories, advice, tips or tricks help. Thank you"
keto,"Please help- gaining weight in a calorie deficit! NAFLD, hypothyroid and breastfeeding.","First - some stats! 26, breastfeeding mama, 4 months postpartum. Current weight 75kg, height 5'5. 

Background info on what's been happening- pre pregnancy I was 65kg, regular gym goer, strict keto-er. Come pregnancy, I couldn't follow a keto diet any longer due to nausea and food aversion. I also became hypothyroid and began to take levothyroxine for that. My weight rocketed to 85kg. About 2 months postpartum I got down to 70kg with flexible keto, eating roughly 1800cal and 70g carbs. Considering I was breastfeeding I followed my appetite and felt this was working for me. It was working so well but then stopped. I slowly stopped seeing any further changes in my body or on the scale. I dropped my calories slowly after this, tried to do intermittent fasting and have dropped my carbs to about 40g. I've been doing this for the past two months. I've been consistent, rarely any cheat days. Each time I weigh myself, the number on the scale is going up. 

I would be so grateful if anyone had any suggestions for me! I'm at my wits end. I also developed NAFLD, not sure when but tests postpartum picked it up. My thyroid labs look normal too so don't think that's the problem."

I was doing OMAD and I feel it's easier for me to manage what I eat that way, but my main problem with it the first time around were the sides. I love potatoes and rice and I don't like veggies at all, well besides corn and onions. I've become more tolerant to them since I did keto but I'd like to try different things other than steamed veggies.

Id like to put forward dr ken berry and dr cywes. Both are actual MD's. Cywes often doesnt list sources but berry does. Feel free to include carnivore youtubers if you feel they nail it. Im sure some people here arent opposed to a bit of carnivore.

keto,"After eating like absolute crap for around 5 days, I managed to enter ketosis in 24 hours??? Does this mean I've acquired a fast metabolism?","I'm 24/M/5'9""/was 148 last week lol

This sounds very silly but when I found out that my mom was going to have family come over for Thanksgiving I got EXTREMELY stressed, for multiple reasons (including not wanting to eat all the crap). The stress/anxiety obviously clouded my mind and started binging. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not talking regular binging. I'm talking a pint of ice cream (550 calories, 5g of carbs) , an entire container of graham crackers (\~1800 calories, 270g of carbs), 600-800 calories worth of bread (no clue how many carbs but probably a shit ton), TONS of fruits, some mushroom cream casserole, chocolate eclairs (which are filled with custard), a bag of spicy dried mango pieces (I ate the entire thing, which is around 180g of carbs and 770 calories). That's what I had on my first night of binging. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately my mom had bought 2 other containers of graham crackers so on the subsequent nights I had an entire container of graham crackers again. Either with ice cream, and/or peanut butter!!!

&amp;#x200B;

The last couple of binge days weren't that bad at all tbh, but the first 3? I was literally eating until I was nauseous.

&amp;#x200B;

I was expecting for it to take like 4 or so days for me to hit ketosis but it's only been 24 hours. On the days where I don't mindlessly binge I'm fairly active but I don't think I'm THAT active.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this mean I have finally acquired a fast metabolism? If so, yay :D"

keto,Experience doing keto with allergies?,"Hey all! I've been doing keto for about 4 months now and I'm 40lb down! One of the problems I've run into is my food allergies prevent me from trying many baking recipes.

Recently I've been using carbquick (carbalose) baking mix as a flour substitute which is hit or miss depending on the recipe. It's definitely disapointing when the recipe fails haha.

My food allergies are; all tree nuts, coconut, &amp; some fruits.

keto,Keto/OMAD journey update and advice,"Hi Keto fam! This is my first post on this forum and would love to hear your advice. I started keto on June 1st 2020 and today I’m down 73 lbs to 228 from 301. Keto has honestly changed my life. I used to weigh more in 8th grade than I do now (27 y/o male). For the past 2-3 months I’ve been on OMAD very strictly and it’s helped a lot. I still need to lose another good 40 lbs at least and my weight has stalled at 228 for around a month now if not more, though I’m sure I’m losing inches. Today I decided to incorporate a 10 minute HIIT workout(body weight exercises) before my omad(~8pm) and damn was it exhausting. The advice I need is when should I be doing my workout for maximum benefit. My goal is to move the hiit workout to the morning before I leave for work and then add a moderate low weight high rep session before my meal. I want to burn fat and gain a little muscle as the loose skin is starting to get to me. Please help me out to formulate the best plan! 🙏🏻"

keto,"After Thanksgiving left-over lunch waffle. Delicious, easy to make. Fucking recipe and pics attached.","So, first, the god damned [picture]( https://i.imgur.com/hqKV0A9.jpg), because I'm eating and I'm happy and this worked out better than expected. 

The recipe couldn't be and fucking easier. 

Take the following list and toss all this shit into a food processor. 

2 eggs  
1.5 cups of turkey breast meat  
1 tablespoon baking powder (not baking soda!)  
1 ~~halapenyo~~, ~~jellypeno~~, fuck. Throw in a hot pepper.

Blend that shit together. Add in this shit next:  
1 cup cheddar cheese  
1/2 cup motzarella  

Mix. Toss in a splash of heavy cream to thin it out, you want a thick batter consistency. Something that if you threw it against the wall it would stick long enough for your mother to see it and beat you with her shoe. If it's too runny, and she'd be worried about stepping in it barefoot, you added too much. It's ruined, and you're a failure. 

Anyhow, put that in the waffle iron. Remember to preheat the waffle iron ahead of time. Remember to spray the waffle iron with oil only after you already added the batter. Panic. Then say fuck it and leave it in. Get into an argument with your girlfriend that it's a nonstick surface and you don't need oil. Explain that this isn't batter, it's meat, so it does. Open the waffle iron to show her, realize they didn't stick. Now it's time to remove them.

Top with sugar free ketchup. Eat while apologizing. Post on reddit in contrition."

keto,"After a hiatus, leg cramps are back!","When I first started keto a few months ago, I began to have regular night time leg cramps. (I was prone to them in the past but not very often, and I have always had trouble with over-tight hamstrings- I'm 6'3"" tall). I then started paying more attention to my electrolytes and taking magnesium citrate and the leg cramps just about stopped and I was sleeping better. I would occasionally still need to be careful how I moved while in bed, but I seldom got a full blown cramp which required me to jump out of bed and walk it out. I lost (and maintained) 20 pounds in my first three months on keto- that was my goal.

Recently the leg cramps are back every night. Cronometer says my average daily intake of sodium is a little over 5000mg, potassium over 2200mg,  magnesium 750mg. I drink about 8-10 cups of water a day. I can not see any significant difference in what I am eating to cause a change.

The FAQ says sodium should be 5000mg/day... or is that a target or a minimum?

Anyone have specific experience or ideas about what else I should try?"
keto,"10kg down in 2 months, question(s)"," 

Hey everyone.

A little about my keto journey:

Male, 20y/o, 186cm (6ft), 125kg (275lbs),

So I started keto on October 1st quite loosely. I didn't do any ""heavy"" research"" and just went with it as a low-carb diet without limiting myself. So I just eliminated bread, sugars, rice, etc. from my diet and ate everything else liberally. I didn't have the ""keto flu"" which is obvious why - I wasn't in ketosis per se (I guess). About a week in, I read more about ketosis and the keto diet, and I started monitoring my diet more strictly and wouldn't even feel hungry all day like before. I didn't crave sugar at all and was beginning to witness weight loss (mostly water weight).

I was 135kg (297 lbs) in October. Today I'm somewhere around 125kg (275 lbs), so a total of 10kg (22 lbs) down.

I started integrating cardio (moderate-intensity walking), stretching, and calisthenics - pushups, squats, etc. just a week ago. I'll weigh myself next week when I'm home and hopefully see progress.

**Here's my question(s):**

I read online that doing cardio (or activity in general) while on the keto diet isn't good, because it might ""burn muscle"" instead of fat or whatever. Is this true?

Is incorporating activity while in ketosis a bad thing? How much is too much? Are there any exercises I shouldn't do on keto?

My calorie intake is an average of 1,000 per day. I eat one meal a day, rarely two that consist of fat primarily and under 15-20g of carbs. Protein is almost 50-70g a day depending on how much fat/carbs I consume on the same day. Is this okay, considering the exercises I do, or should I eat more?

I also take supplements, such as vitamin C, D, and recently bought omega-3 and B12. Others advised taking collagen, MCT oil, and electrolytes (I drink homemade electrolyte water). Is this necessary?

I don't want to lose weight and be left with loose skin. It's the reason I never had the will to lose weight. The idea of loose skin scared me. That's why I'm building muscle and taking supplements.

Sorry for the mess of a post :)"
keto,Athlete Advice?,Any athletes that could give some recommendation on maintaining energy? Traditionally I'm a weight lifter with years of high carb/ high protein diet.

It seems that even if I eat a decent high fat meal a few hours beforehand I'm still bogging down pretty early. How do you guys keep your energy levels up?
keto,Good tasting keto smoothie recipes without sweetner?,"Does anyone have keto smoothies without sweetners they can recommend?

My breakfast is usually some protein powder, greens supplement (Athletic Greens), and coconut milk. Since starting keto I have noticed that I'm so not hungry during lunch that I usually end up not making an actual meal, but taking a couple small snacks - so I end up with calories that are too low and I feel like I'm not enough vegetables. So I want to try to make my morning smoothie a bit more nutritious.

I've updated my smoothie by adding avocado, but it tastes a little weird, especially compared to my non-keto smoothie that usually had a banana. I don't want to add any sweetener - the non-sugar kind just taste weird to me (or upset my stomach if they are sugar alcohols). I don't even want the smoothie to be sweet necessarily, just to taste good/intentional.

I'm flexible around carbs - my daily limit is 30 and I'm ok with up to 15 of those being breakfast."

keto,Popular keto youtuber Dr. Eric Berg is a fraud,"Recently, Eric Berg has done a [video on vitamin A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzBnjfjbjUM). The information in this video is completely plagiarized  from [Chris Kresser’s Article about vitamin A](http://healthybabycode.com/why-you-cant-get-vitamin-a-from-eating-vegetables). No credit has been given to Chris Kresser. The study Berg links in his description is the only source for his video. That study however says nothing about beta-carotene conversion to retinol. It also says nothing about the genetic disposition of a bad converter. He basically copied the information from ONE article word by word and made a video about it. This is not how you do scientific research, not to mention its unethical not giving credit to the only source you use. 

People get fooled by Berg’s professional appearance and blindly trust him. Just because he calls himself a doctor (which he is not) and uses a white board like a teacher does, doesn’t mean he’s credible.
It’s apparent the guy is just trying to sell his supplements, which is ironic since in the past he has advised against taking supplements. 

That being said, the article from Chris Kresser itself is filled with misinformation about vitamin A.
The study about the 3% conversion rate has nothing to do about the conversion from beta-carotene to retinol. It only says that when carrots are consumed raw and without additional fat source the bio-availability of beta-carotene is 3%. But when cooked and eaten with additional fat this 3% availability increases to almost 40%. 
Further, the study where he claims 45% of adults can’t convert any beta-carotene is miss-interpreted.
The study shows that about 45% of people just have a reduced capability of conversion. This reduced capability can range from 32% less conversion, to 69% less conversion. So to claim 45% cant convert at all is false.
Also, Eric Berg mentions that the recommended daily dose of vitamin A is 9000µg per day, which is completely false. The recommended daily dose is around 800 to 1000µg retinol per day. 
In Chris Kresser’s article, he calculates how much retinol you would need with a 3% conversion rate to get the same amount of retinol you would from beef liver. So Eric Berg also completely miss-understood the only source he was using. 

Lets do a calculation if carrots actually provide enough retinol:

[This study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20200262/) shows that in people without the genetic disposition, the beta-carotene to retinol conversion in a carrot has a ratio of 15:1. 
100g of fat cooked carrot we get 7600µg of beta-carotene. If we apply the ratio from above, we would get 506µg of retinol from 100g carrots. So to get 800µg we would need to consume 160g of carrots per day which is less than half a pound. Far less than the 4.4 pounds stated.
If you have the genetic disposition to convert less, then it will become harder to to meet the daily value but not impossible if you eat carrots, sweet potato, kale, honey melons and mangos daily. For convenience the easiest is of course to consume liver or retinol supplements."

I had a blood panel done in the morning after 12 hours of fasting and my blood glucose was 87, which is normal. Does that mean I'm not IR, or does that mean that I could be IR but keto keeps the glucose low, or does that mean nothing at all?

keto,Increased intolerance to carbs/sugary foods,"I started eating extremely low-carb a month or two ago for health reasons, since I had a few weeks of terrible eating that really messed up my gut and eating almost anything that wasn't meat or eggs really destroys me. I've noticed that the longer I go without eating certain things, the more they really impact me when I do have them, even things I used to eat constantly a few years ago. When I was 15 I basically lived on boxed pasta and canned red sauce, but if I even have a couple bites of anything with wheat or gluten in it I feel absolutely terrible well into the next day. This is especially true for sugar, I can't have any sugar whatsoever without getting cramps and bloating for at least 8 hours afterwards.

I'm just wondering how normal/common of an experience this is, I guess. As many people around me have noted, I'm ""too young for all these issues"", being only 18 years old. If this isn't a common experience, I'd like to know so I can look into potential causes. I'd also like to mention that when I don't eat things I know I can't, I experience zero issues whatsoever and I've put several issues I have into remission, including my eczema which I assumed would be with me for life.

Basically, I have no intention on ever trying to return to a high-carbohydrate way of eating, but would like to know if my experience being unable to eat things I used to be able to is a normal thing that happens to others as well."

I'm on keto for a medical reason, I have a rare disease but if I'm not overeating, working out and drinking water it does keep my weight under control. I've never cheated because of my rare condition but I do struggle with over eating and maybe not choosing the best Keto options always. I'm also failing on the fitness end of things. I'm the only one in my family who is keto. It's like smoking when a bunch of people around you are smoking it's hard to quit. In the same way my family are all pretty heavy set people and my boyfriend while skinny can throw down loads of food. When I see them snacking I want to snack even if it's Keto I'm still overeating and stalling any progress because of my calorie intake. Before Covid I was really skinny, eating great, sleeping great, working out all the time and drinking lots of water. I've since gained 15lbs but it feels like a lot more to me and haven't worked out consistently in months. My boyfriend and I are on opposite schedules so working out with him is impossible and I also can't drive so realistically getting to a gym is not an option for me without having to give an arm and a leg to take a Lyft. Like I said when we are home together he really doesn't eat healthy. I'm looking for advice from people who truly only have the option for home workouts and literally no one but themselves for motivation. I also want to add that before Covid I lived with my parents but have since moved out into an apartment with my boyfriend. I do live relatively close to a lake and in a good area to go running and I'm trying to order a yoga mat to do hone workouts but keeping in mind that I live in an apartment on the second floor. I'm a 19yr-old female who currently goes to school and works all the time but I graduate on January 23rd so hopefully not having school in the mix will help decrease the stress and develop a better schedule."

keto,Body resistance on losing weight?,"Hi everyone!   
First time posting in this subreddit, but this is not my first rodeo on Keto. 5 years ago I lost 70lbs on this diet, I stayed on it for two years and I ended up getting off of it with a registered dietician who fattened me up 20 pounds and did a failed cut on me after a reverse diet. 

I ended up coming back to Keto but I'm finding the second time around the weight loss is very slow. I think my general trend is still going down, but I'm not sure why my body after a two year break is so resistant to dropping weight. I've lost 9lbs but no inches so far.   


I started some exercise by walking on incline 3x a week on the treadmill. I eat about 1200-1400 cal a day typically depending on the day. I'm in Ketosis, confirmed with keto stick tests and it's in the strong category.  


This time around I'm eating 40 net a day rather than 20. Is it normal to bounce like this with my weight loss instead of something more linear? Is this normal? Should I KCKO? Or do I actually have something wrong with me? I'm getting really frustrated lately.

My weight loss trend --&gt; [https://i.imgur.com/YBvek9s.png](https://i.imgur.com/YBvek9s.png)

I guess after the registered dietician failed to do a cut to make me drop weight I just feel like I'm really broken."
keto,Reduction of mini-epileptic fits,"I used to have regular 'visions' that were pretty much hallucinations, usually involving a God or an angel or some kind. And sometimes overwhelming episodes of spontaneous religious ecstasy, my body would freeze up while it was happening. Since I started extended water fasting and keto three years ago, I've had zero instances of these. My 'kummerspeck' has also evaporated and I'm a healthy weight now. It's funny too that all my favourite foods are keto, it's all the things I craved as a kid and my tastes haven't much changed as an adult. I never knew how much high carb foods made me groggy until I changed up and had a means of comparison.

I didn't start with doctor's or nutritionist's advice and haven't had any medical support but I was really surprised at the efficacy of this routine. I didn't know what I was going through was a form of epilepsy either. I always had an idea of epileptics like in the movies with full-on seizures, eyes rolled back and foaming at the mouth. I didn't know it could be more subtle than that, or that the God stuff was a factor.

I sort of miss though the existential comfort the fits gave me when they had religious content. Not that I felt 'special' or 'chosen' especially but that I felt my life had a more cosmic context, like the universe was sentient and I could talk to it, it knew me, it wasn't indifferent. Even though it seems overall more of a relief to my body not to have them, I feel like I've lost something. Something that made life a bit more interesting and less... cold and hard. I suppose it's a loss of faith, on some level I believed in the literal reality of them. I write music too and the intense sacral feelings were a great inspiration. I'm at a bit of a loss now, even though my body feels healthier and less stressed."

keto,How to make Rebel Ice Cream extra creamy,"It's a trick I learned applies to all types of ice cream, keto or otherwise. It's so simple you'll probably wonder why you didn't think of it yourself.  


Put the ice cream in the refrigerator for 2-3 hours prior to consuming it.  


That's it.  


What happens is that the ice cream slowly warms up so the edges don't get 'melty' and the core can dissipate heat more. it's all about temperature differentials.  


If you wanted to, you could get the timing down pat for whatever temperature of consistency you like the most. Or you could even control the temperature enough to get the entire pint to be the 'perfect' temperature."

I started with strict keto for 1 month ( less than 20 g carbs per day ) and saw huge difference then moved to weekly 1 cheat day for the last 2 months.

Currently I lost 10 Kg (22 lbs) which I know is not a great deal in this subreddit, but I'm happy for myself. I have never seen this much lean myself after my studies.

The bad news, I feel like crap and don't understand it - I used to eat this stuff in much larger amounts without a problem, now I have horrible carb cravings and my head hurts. Why is that?
Is the body more sensitive to carbs when on keto? Or is it just the caloric deficit speaking through carbs?

Starting keto was fairly easy for me and I didn't have any cravings, but now all I can think about is carbs and I'm worried that I won't be strong enough to resist it. Do you have any tips on how to get back on the keto train?
I was thinking about dropping the caloric restriction for a day to shut up the cravings with a full stomach. Do you think that could help?"

I told the teens that whatever they're cooking (they each cook at least once a week, from a recipe), it was coming from a specific group of cookbooks (all keto books).  I also cut out nightshades, 'cause let's just say we do not get along.  I'm not counting calories, or even recording how many carbs I'm eating.  I'm just making sure each meal is under 7 carbs, total, not including sugar alcohols, and trying to avoid overly processed foods.  I'm not terribly worried about

According to the BMI my scale calculates, I've moved from obese to just overweight.  

My joints are hurting a LOT less.  My digestive system is much happier.  I'm a lot happier.  

Today's plan was chicken fried steak (breaded with crushed pork rinds and parmesan) with cream gravy (made with the leftover in the pan, plus cream cheese and heavy cream and maybe a touch of glucomannan to make it thicker) with green beans, mashed cauliflower and low carb rolls for me, and mashed potatoes and Hawaiian bread for everybody else.

But then I started a new job and couldn't keep up the low carb intake anymore (you know, had to eat everything my employers offered lol). Anyhow, I still didn't consume any sweets or sugary drinks, just some pastries with coffee etc etc.

Two months after I quit the keto and stepped on a scale again I was happily surprised: I was barely at **83kg** (another **-2kg!**). I'm happy to say that when you get to the point that you are satisfied, it's pretty easy to keep the diet running, as I haven't had any sugar cravings for the whole time - and it's probably the reason that I still kept losing weight.

keto,The hidden rage/thirst,"So I started a keto diet just over three weeks ago. And I have to say it feels like a great success (and I'm glad I joined this sub, the mosts have been so motivational.) I've noticed serious changes in my body and I've dropped 6kg from my average of the last few months. 

But I've noticed two things this week that I'm wondering about, both of which took me by surprise. 

First, it was a severe case of hanger... but with no hunger. I've gotten into the routine of having three eggs for breakfast, but on Monday I woke late and was just busy at work. But I wasn't hungry so I just continued on.   
And people in work started to reeeeally annoy me. In one situation I had to re-write an email about five times because I was about to go nuclear with a lot of senior people. And throughout the day, I just felt soooo angry, like, a fury. Which is funny, because typically I'm known as a pretty serene ""cool under pressure"" type. So when I felt this burning rage in me and it was just in reaction to everything and not just one incident, I realised something was off. I was hangry (which has happened before.) 

Has anyone experienced this and is there a key dietary piece that can prevent it happening? 

The next bit was not so much thirst, but rather the lack of thirst. For two days I had extremely difficult stools to pass, the first day I was torn apart. So sore. Day 1 the water was cloudy so I didn't really seee the stool, but on day 2, yup, it looked like a a bunch of pebbles glued together, so hugely dehydrated. But, I didn't feel thirsty.   
Now, I should have known better. Everyone on here talks about how much water you need to drink and I kinda expected to be thirsty and drinking loads of water, but when that thirst never came, I just forgot about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm making sure I get breakfast and drink a set amount of water regardless, but is this lack of body signals to be expected? In one way, it's kinda great because I feel I'm already past cravings and such, but, at the same time... I'd worry if my body isn't giving me key feedback"
keto,How do I overcome the Carb cravings at the 3 day mark of doing keto,"Yesterday was 3 days into keto, and I got the worst carb cravings last night. I ended up eating some granola bars the had 24 carbs each. 

What are some keto food that I can eat to counteract/subdue the carb cravings?"
keto,Societal Pressures with KETO,"(Kinda long post so TL;DR @ the end)

So, I’ve been doing keto and IF for over half a year now and I truly enjoy it. I’ve dealt with EDs in the past, mostly in the way of restricting and binge eating. Keto and IF have helped me immensely with food guilt because as long as it’s under my carb intake I don’t need to worry if I deserve the food. I don’t have to “earn” any food. And with IF, if I want to
eat in my eating window I can, and if it’s not my eating window, I don’t. No guilt, no second guessing if I ‘deserve’ something. 


Many people have told me they have great success with ‘Intuitive Eating’ and many dietician I see recommend it, but with me personally, I get overwhelmed by food options. It’s far too easy for me to slip into a toxic mindset when it’s just “what do I feel like eating.” 
Keto takes all the guess work out of eating.


Not to mention, I LIKE the foods I can eat on keto. I like, rich, fatty foods, and I like nutrient dense keto foods. I feel like I get a wide variety and never lack in what my body needs.


My energy greatly improved while doing keto, and my mental health vastly improved. Yet, even with all of that, many people have tried to tell me to
quit keto. I even go so far to say “I don’t promote a keto way of eating” because it’s true, I don’t think people should promote elimination diets in a world that shames many people (especially young women) into saying they don’t deserve certain foods. BUT, elimination diets do work for ME. Yet, when I say this people have even gone so far as to tell me I have an eating disorder, which really hurts me emotionally because I FINALLY feel like I’ve truly overcome a lot of my disordered eating with keto and IF. 


People ask me when I’m going to stop, especially since I’ve lost a significant amount of
weight for someone my height. People say I’m not eating enough nutrients even though I never even thought about what I was putting into my body before keto, and was far more nutrient deficient. People have told me IF doesn’t work, even though cultures all over the world practice it and NOT fasting is actually a very Eurocentric idea that stems from problematic ideals. 


To top it all off, I decided to wean myself off keto so I can enjoy a “normal” thanksgiving, and it’s been so difficult for me emotionally. My issues with binge eating have resurfaced after over half
a year of not having to deal with that. I feel terrible and sluggish. And the worst part is..I’m doing what everyone around me WANTS me to do (go off keto), but they truly don’t care about how it’s affecting me. 


I don’t know what my point is with this, but as a young woman, I’ve been told a lot about how I should look and what I should do by others and society, and when I finally make the choice for myself, I feel constantly berated for it. Is there anyone out there that feels similarly? 


TL;DR: I feel pressured to quit keto for many reasons, and no one seems to care that I enjoy keto and it works for me.

keto,Feeling nauseous,"Started keto on Sunday! Enjoying it so far, haven’t really felt hungry, enjoyed all my meals etc, down 5lbs already (I know it’ll be water weight). Today I had a super early shift so I didn’t eat much at work and I’m about to make dinner but I feel really nauseous, is this normal? I felt fine yesterday, a little tired maybe but not sick.

keto,"Spoke to my doctor, he knows nothing about keto. Idk what to do now?","I told him I was having chest pains immediately after taking my medication Hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and metformin. And I told him I think my electrolytes are probably not up to par and told him that I’ve read that I need to up my sodium intake he says no he thinks I should just limit my intake. Completely shot me down, he said he doesn’t see how those meds Would do that so it’s probably not them and to keep taking them. I’m 330 lbs. I tell him I’m drinking 230-250 oz of water and he credits it to too much water and to limit my water. I know some of you will say go get a second opinion but it’s not that easy the way my situation is set up. 

He completely everything I’ve read about keto. I’ve never liked this guy. Very condescending and dismissive. But what can I even do about this now?"
keto,Reasonablly priced Zero Net Carb Keto Bread loaves in Denver?,"My wife and I just moved back to Denver from a small town in Wisconsin. I've been on and off keto for the past year or so, and one of my keto staples was zero net carb bread for a lunch sandwich. Our little small town had two different brands that were amazing: [Natural Ovens keto bread](http://www.naturalovens.com/18oz-keto-bread/80653/) and [Aldi's L'Oven Zero Net Carb bread]
(https://www.aldi.us/en/products/bakery-bread/bread/detail/ps/p/loven-fresh-zero-net-carbs-bread-wheat-multiseed/).

Unfortunately Aldi doesn't exist out here and Natural Ovens in a Wisconsin-based company. I've been scouring all of the grocery store websites, Trader Joe's, King Soopers, Safeway, Target, Walmart, CostCo, Sam's Club, etc, for anything that's a reasonably priced zero net carb bread. All I've found so far is a product from [Whole Foods](https://products.wholefoodsmarket.com/product/base-culture-keto-bread-d59956) that's $12 a loaf and doesn't look very appetizing.

Any ideas people can throw my way? I don't really want to spend more than ~$5ish a loaf so ordering online is likely out of the question.

Thanks in advance!"
keto,Feeling like a fraud masquerading as someone who is getting close to a healthy weight. Maybe I'm convinced I won't be able to keep it?,"I have lost 57lbs in 5 months, I recently hit a healthy BMI as well. Keto feels so incredibly easy, I'm getting to the point where I judge people who try and fall off immediately (I don't actually feel this, that's my gut reaction and then I immediately correct myself to realize that dieting is hard, I failed for so long and I was just ready this time) but it's just so natural to me now that it feels like it should be like this for everyone. 

I still feel like I am just an obese person, like that's how I'm going to be forever, like there is no way I could be like this forever and there is no possibility of getting to my goal weight. This is all even though I lost 12lbs last month, I'm not slowing down on keto, am much more naturally eating healthily by meal prepping with my boyfriend, eating lots of veggies and basically making this a lifestyle. I'm SCARED to eat carbs again one day, scared that cravings are going to be so bad, that I'm going to go back to old habits and let myself go again. 

I really feel like a fraud already and I'm not even there yet. I used to sabotage myself for sure, I am working very hard to make sure I don't do that this time and it's finally working. I can't imagine a world where this keeps working, but yet it keeps just working. This whole keto thing is insane. 

Has anyone out there experienced this serious self doubt even while succeeding so much? How did you get over it?"

keto,"Today, I'm back to my original weight from 2 years ago - 330Ibs...","I don't post here too often, mostly lurk unless I had a question about keto, but I felt like I wanted to share this.

So about 2 years ago, around January 2019 I bought a weight scale and weighed in at 330 pounds. I actually tried keto as well back then but very quickly fell off, I had no idea what I was doing and ultimately stayed around the same weight. Over time I stopped worrying about what I ate and stopped weighing myself all the way until August of this year, when I suddenly decided to weigh myself again out of curiosity. I was 390 pounds, close to 400. It was crazy how much weight I gained in what I felt was so little time and I felt so ashamed that I just let myself go.

I decided that month around August 20th that I would get back on track with a diet, my main motivation was not wanting to see the number 4 on the scale, I just wanted to get away from there. I picked up keto again because it still seemed like the most sustainable to me. I did it properly this time reading up a ton of information I never seen before, eating much less fat and worrying mostly about protein, and I was losing weight incredibly fast. Today, just 3 months since the start of keto, I weighed in at 330.6. I melted through about 60 pounds in 3 months.


While I'm happy that so much weight has been lost, it also feels kind of bittersweet because I weighed this much before, all I did was get back to where I was. If I took keto seriously from the beginning I could have been well into the 200s. But I'm trying not to look at things like that. For me, this feels like the true start of my journey. From here on, backtracking is over. Everything I lose now will be new weight lost, and that's incredibly exciting to me and why I felt the need to share this little mini goal.

 Keto absolutely works, it's the only diet I had this much success with and I thank this subreddit so much for having such helpful information and inspiration and compiled together. Hopefully in a year or so I can post a true success story, but for now, it only goes down from here!"

keto,I gained weight? Why?,I posted recently about how I lost 20 lbs. The past three days I've noticed a steady increase. I have been sticking to keto. Tracking my calories (under 1200) and protein and fat. Idk why. But I've gained 3 lbs. Should I fast? Run? I always weigh myself first thing in the morning.
keto,My experience so far,Hey all first time poster here. Just wanted to share my experience so far. I have had pretty crippling IBS most of my life and basically resigned myself to bathroom troubles forever. But since I have gone pretty strict keto I have had none of the pain and bathroom problems. I don't know if that is because I'm a celiac or because keto is somehow helping. But I am loving this change. It's given me my life back to go out and do things away from the house with my family.
keto,Finally put together some “progress pics”!,"Holy crap.  I need to vent.

I had started Keto November 2019.  I fell off the keto wagon back in June 2020 right before my brain decided to take a massive nosedive into depression.  I work in respiratory therapy management...global pandemic and all...yada yada.  It’s been a rough year, to say the least, and I’ve had to take some time off for my mental health.

With the help of my doctor (August 2020), I started some self-care, and decided to focus on my eating habits as a sort of distraction.  I’ve been on keto since.  Total (on/off) over the last year - I’ve lost 93lbs.  I don’t take pictures of myself often, but my roommate does.  She shared some recent pics with me, and made some comments about the very visible changes. 

I’ve been a longtime lurker here.  I haven’t felt a lot of support lately, and I’ve found so much positivity on this subreddit.  I’ve finally hit a weight with a “1” in front of it, and I needed to tell someone : )

keto,Can keto help you avoid COVID-19,"So I was on the keto connect live feed (they do this everyday on IG I think) and was very surprised when they got candid about covid resistance.  

Someone asked them about their thanksgiving plans and there was a bit of hesitation at first to discuss and they made a general comment by one of them that they were having some people over. But when asked again, they mentioned several friends and multiple families were coming to their new house and that they don’t agree with any covid restrictions or government advice in general about health. One also mentioned that everyone was “pretty much keto” so they aren’t at any risk of spreading anything “if there really is anything”.

Someone else on the feed asked about masks and Matt pretty much commented that if you are unhealthy enough where you need a mask than you should look at your life choices (paraphrasing) 

This is in the weeds, but anyone else heard or read about keto helping with covid resistance or anything like that? I’ve been doing it for about 1 year and I feel like I’ve gotten a flu and cold in that time but I know I feel better generally."
keto,Just looking for some feedback on expectations of weight loss,"I do understand everyone is different in terms of how their body reacts to keto.  I started keto in mid September at 332lbs as of Nov 24 I am at 275. It took a little while to get my macros/calories in check for the first 30 days my weight was all over the place.  For about the past 6 weeks I have lost about a 1lb a day.  However for the last 10 days I've mysteriously reduced my weight loss to 0.5lbs per day, this change happened literally overnight. No change in calories/macros or exercise.  Does anyone have any input or insight to this?"

keto,More and more changes.,"It all clicked for me at the end of August. I was feeling sluggish, really depressed and sore. I was 291.2lbs and deeply ashamed that i let it get this out of hand. I had to do something about it!

I started watching what i was eating and exercising more. I went from 291.2 to 268.2 by 6th November. With two bad weeks i might add. 
Sadly I started to feel like my weight loss was stalling and not working out all that great. This was when i decided to give Keto a chance and continued with regular exercise. Im happy to share that i am currently I am 260.4lbs. (Week 3 weigh in is on friday).


Today I was straight up and out at the shops before my coffee. Doesn't sound like much but it used to take me a while to fully wake up - plus i always looked for a coffee and something to eat before i done a single thing. Ive energy and a new found ""get up and go"" attitude.
Today also marks me not needing sweetener in my coffee. Just coffee and cream. Crazy thing is, it didn't actually feel like i was missing anything.

I guess i just wanted to share that i am so relieved to find something that works and I'm starting to see small but great changes. It's simple, it's not always easy but it's more than worth it."
keto,"20+days in, I had to punch few more holes in my belt.","Hey there, just a follow up to my journey so far:


Lost a lot of  weight 6kg+

Was complimented for my skin clearing up and my face gains.

I no longer crave sugar or bread, I was phasing junk food way before i started keto cause it was making me sick. 


Regular bowel movements, non of that inconsistent roll dice crap... 

Better mood , more focus on personal cleanliness and hygiene some how you have extra time and energy to do chores on keto.

No longer have flash sweat after every meal.

Lots of walking in the park with a focus on slow heartbeat and breathing ( low oxygenation doesn't burn fat, stay under 120bpm on your walks)

keto,New Allergic Reaction,"Hey guys, I've a question that someone may be able to answer.

I've been keto for 3 months now. Just in the last 5 days I've started having an allergic reaction to something, where I break out in hives (they start itchy and swell) for about 2 hours and then they go away. This happens at the end of my day, a few hours after I've ate dinner. I have not introduced anything new into my diet and I'm having a lot of trouble narrowing down the culprit.

Has anybody experienced anything similar to this? At first a thought it may be keto rash but the symptoms sound different to what I've got going on. My current thinking is that my body is suddenly not meshing with artificial sweeteners, but I haven't been able to confirm it yet.

If anyone has any experience or advice I'd love to hear from you."

This has produced great results as I’m down almost 140 pounds in that time grime and feel much better about myself. Over the past few months though I’ve noticed I’m more fatigued along with having joint pain. I’ve heard that ckd can help alleviate some of these symptoms while also resetting my hormones to help speed along the final bit of weight loss as I’m quite close to my goal. I also make sure to get enough electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals. Just wondering if anyone has any tips for how to do this such as when and what carbs to eat and even just how it’s worked for them. Thanks."
keto,How much weight loss when already in a healthy weight range?,"Hey guys!

I just have a questions for anyone who started Keto who were at the top end of a healthy weight range already?
Or anyone who managed to do Keto to their goal weight.

I am a few pounds under the “healthy weight” according to bmi calculators, but still wish to lose another 14 pounds (still within the healthy weight boundaries) 

What sort of weight loss did you experience week on week? 

I lost 4 pounds my first week, however being as I’m not technically over weight I do not think it will carry on that way.

Not that it matters, I am just a little intrigued 🙂

keto,Side effects of Keto | Keto beginnner,"Keto beginner 
73kg to 61.7kg in 4 weeks with Keto + OMAD + water fasting + water cut.

Long story short these are the side effects of above.

1. Skin: My skins got vibrant and supple to my surprise. I was worried my skins will get saggy but had opposite effect.


2. Energy: I don't want to sound too cult, but for some reason, I was able to achieve and maintain most of days as how I felt just after 30min of meditating. To be absolutely honest, I had some carbs after achieving my weight goal. I didn't really feel ""lethargic"" or ""bad"". However, I felt similar bad ""high"" as sugar high. Keto + OMAD zen is becoming addictive.


3. Inflammation: old injuries from my old sprinter injuries in my lower back, pelvis, tail bone gone. They were gone. After carbs? It's back. 


Look, all I am saying is that you guys hooked me into this. It is you guys' fault.


Thank you"
keto,Eating perfect keto can’t get ketones up! HELP!,"Let me start by a short intro. SW: 435 pounds 6 ft Male 28 (at the time Feb 2018). CW: 290 pounds. I have had plenty of overall success with keto diet. Quarantine I dropped 50 pounds in 5 months but the stalled around 295.

How could this be, so this kicks me into the last 3 weeks of very clean, very strict keto, check it last night .7! Finally 3 weeks and it’s starting to move!

keto,Putting Keto on Pause,"I discovered this subreddit about six years ago, and within about 2 years I went from 250lbs to 190lbs. Over the last couple of years the weight began creeping back up, now I'm somewhere around 270lbs. Staying at home has certainly not helped and some bad habits like having a drink every night and being fairly sedentary became all too easy.

Back in December I started feeling pains about where my liver is and started getting what I can only describe as IBS like symptoms.

I got a feeling that maybe my liver has been overtaxed and have eaten a more Mediterranean diet the last couple of days. Pains around my liver have all but disappeared and my bowel movements are returning to normal.

I feel no difference switching my diet at the moment and have taken to walking more for some exercise.

Can't see a doctor at the moment, and I'm not looking for medical advice exactly. But, I'm wondering if Keto should be something I cycle in and out of rather than stick to permanently.

I want to work off the weight again, and Keto was miraculous for me. But what once felt like having the cheat codes for weight loss now feels incompatible.

Wondering if anyone has thoughts on this, or advice? Much appreciated!

Edit: I'll also add the first thing I did when the IBS-like symptoms began was watch my fat intake to see if that was the problem. The only thing that has seemed to help is stopping Keto altogether."

Loved the thing, I could finish the entire thing by myself. I hadn’t had it for months and since there was some at home I decided to give it a shot. It was hell. It tasted like pure sugar. I could barely finish a tablespoon. Have ice creams always had that much sugar? How do people eat that? This definitely made it easier to avoid sugar from now on.

keto,"""Strict"" Keto is Easier Than the Alternative","I have been doing ""strict"" keto for two months. By this I mean, I have been in ketosis, more or less, for 2 months, with some days coming out of it for dumb excuse reasons. But I always got right back on the horse, only eating OMAD (one meal a day) because I was always full, eating ketogenic recipes, and losing unhealthy weight rapidly. 

That is until last weekend when I went home and decided that I could come out of ketosis for a few days, and eat more than OMAD. When I left, I decided that I might ease up on ketosis. After all, ""OMAD is probably where my weight loss is coming from anyways,"" right? Well, I woke up Monday morning feeling hungry, fatigued, and irritated. I had to eat three meals, and got hungry after a few hours later since I was eating carbs. I realize this is probably normal for most people, but after doing keto for 2 months I forgot this feeling. No wonder people think OMAD is so difficult, it doesn't seem possible to me while not on keto. 

Regardless of whether ketosis has weight loss benefits in-and-of itself, I have been reminded of why I am doing keto in the first place. Ketosis helps stabilize my blood sugar, my hunger levels, and my mood. It allows me to do intermittent fasting, and not binge eat. It is ""possible"" for me to lose weight not on keto, but it is SO much easier when I am in ketosis. 

Just wanted to give some words of encouragement to my fellow ketogenic homies. Stay the course, it works (for me) and there's really no good reason to go back! Ironically, the stricter you are about your ketogenic diet, the easier it is to lose weight. Carbs truly aren't worth it!"

I have struggled with my weight the majority of my life, falling on and off every diet wagon everytime. The whole ""everything  is ok in moderation"" wasn't working because obviously I didn't have the self-control. 

About 2 years ago, one of my best ""big"" friends passed away from the same underline health issues that I had at age 35. This really made me take inventory of my life and those I love. I had to find my cure to be there to grow old with my wife and watch my children become adults.

This led me to researching my conditions with the root cause conclusion being, I was too heavy (fat). I read several articles about Keto and was willing to try it. I remember the idea of the switch from carbs to ketones feeling so foreign to me at the time.

In order to make Keto work for me, I had to first change my mentality towards food. Stop thinking ""man this sucks I can't have that"" to ""I can't have that because I am allergic and it will make me sick.""  Then, know for a person like me (predisposed type 2 diabetic) there can't be a stop date for keto. It has to be my new lifestyle. 

Happy to report that I am now only on 2 pills a day for the the diabetes and so that I found something that works for me and most likely saved my life. 

Best of luck to everyone on the same journey. I am so happy to find a community of so many kind souls always willing to cheer each other on and offer up some many inspiration stories.

keto,Why am I not losing weight?,"I just weighed myself and it’s making me wanna give up. I gained 3 pounds. I do IF, Strict Keto, count all my macros and exercise. I haven’t weighed myself in days for a reason. That was so demoralizing. Idk what to do.

keto,My blood pressure is 183/72 after about 15 days on keto.,"How tf did I get to this?

M/24/327

I’ve been eating the right amount of calories. But I haven’t been taking the recommended amount of electrolytes because I’m on 3 types of medications. Hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and lisinopril. What should I do?"
keto,Is chelated magnesium stable in water (keto-ade)?,"I have magnesium orotate and magnesium d-aspartate powder. I've recently been getting into keto-ade and decided to make some with the raw electrolyte powders I already have. Is it safe to have chelated magnesium sitting in water with potassium citrate, calcium citrate, and salt? My concern is it combining with something else to render the magnesium ineffective or toxic. Thanks!"
keto,200 Days and ~5lbs left to GW!,"I hit my 200 days of keto mark and I figured I would share a community update and progress pic:

[https://imgur.com/a/PWXzKg5](https://imgur.com/a/PWXzKg5)

I'm \~25lbs down from when I started give or take the day and how much water retention I'm having lol The pic on the far left is a few months before I started this keto journey in May this year - I felt awful because that photo was taken at a good friend's bridal shower (before the whole country shut down) and when the photos came out I could barely recognize myself and I'd had enough. Pic on the right was taken yesterday, and the pics in the middle are approximately one month apart from each other. 

Biggest difference of all besides the weight is the energy level and a totally new, sustained commitment to fitness and exercise. I never thought I would be the type to run regular 5Ks for fun or lift weights but 200 days later I get antsy if I don't work out in some way daily. I'm less concerned about whether or not my final GW will ever come but more focused on consistency and keeping keto in my diet just to stay sane to be honest. Excited to see what the next 100 days brings!"
keto,Post meal fatigue,"I’ve been noticing recently that I’m getting extremely tired and sleepy after meals. I normally try to eat one big meal a day in the afternoon around 1-2pm, and a light snack before 6pm. I’ve been Keto for about 3 years now, and have no real health issues. I’m just concerned because the food coma I’ve been dealing with recently has been pretty strong. Has anyone else experienced this, and know how to fix it?"
keto,Very upset about my High Cholesterol,"My latest blood work showed significant increase in cholesterol. 

Here are the stats:
Cholesterol total - 365 mg/dL
HDL - 62 mg/dL
Triglycerides- 49 mg/dL
LDL - 287 mg/dL
Cholesterol/HDLC Ratio - 5.9
Non HDL Cholesterol- 303 mg/dL

For reference I’m am a 42 yo F 5”5’ 125lbs. I’ve been on keto on/off since January.

My doctors pushed me to stop Keto and start statin. I’m refusing for now but I’m extremely worried about possibility of heart issues. I’m under a lot of stress most of the time recently (aren’t we all). 

My doctor doesn’t understand my desire to be on Keto since I don’t need to lose weight and don’t have any medical issues. He thinks I should stop immediately. 

What advice could you all give me? 

Is my cholesterol too high and I should stop keto and get on meds. 

Should I even bother being on keto, since I don’t really have the reason? (Except high energy level and possibly prevention of future medical conditions)

Any advice would be highly appreciated!"
keto,Keto and Smoking,"I am a chain smoker and keto helped me reduce smoking to 2 cigarettes a day. I dont even feel like finishing my cigarettes, even these 2 i throw out after few puffs. Keto has been great. Just wanted to share. And yeah lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks, most of it is water weight"

keto,do you experience less sinus congestion when you're in ketosis?,"I do experience significantly less sinus congestion when I'm in ketosis. I'm wondering if that's just me with a mild undiscovered food allergy, or if it's a more common experience.

background info to avoid the autobot removal ....I have been doing keto for about 6 weeks and lots of things improved for me physically, one of them was sinus congestion.  I am pretty much keto for life now because it helps me with anxiety and fatigue.  A few days ago I did a sort of ""food challenge"" with 1 carby meal to figure out if it's safe or practical for me to go off the keto diet temporarily for holiday food gift situations.  Thinking that if I refuse a food gift then it's less awkward to refuse if I can explain medically why I can't eat it (and that requires knowing what happens to me if I eat it). 
 After that food challenge I experienced lot of sinus congestion the next day (as well as what seemed to be a blood sugar episode a few hours after I ate it).  I'm pretty sure I have blood sugar issues in general so that's not the part I'm asking about, just curious if anyone else has less sinus congestion when they're in ketosis or if this is just my body being mildly allergic to something in my food challenge."

I did keto before when I was 14 but I didn’t really care about my growth. But now I am worried that if it will stunt my growth.

I wanted to go on a keto diet and came across this cookbook that shared over 100 recipes made of 100% keto.

We got a ham from Costco as the main dish (we don't really like turkey). Anyone have any favorite keto sides ideas that might pair well? I am the only low carb one but that doesn't mean that I can't make something awesome that everyone will love. I'm thinking a nice cauliflower mash (never made this before) and maybe some roasted brussel sprouts. I think I will also make a special keto friendly dessert for his special occasion.
keto,Lowest weight in 10 years,"Hey guys! Long time lurker here and I first time poster. I’m writing this to thank you all, without the wealth of great information and inspiring stories on this subreddit I wouldn’t be where I am today. After hitting 316lbs at the beginning of the year I finally decided to make a change and do the keto diet, as hard as it was in the beginning as of this weekend I can finally say I’m the lowest I’ve been in 10 years, I’m now 229 and that’s exactly what I weighed my first day of high school gym class back in 2010! So once again thank you all! Everyone out there still on their own journey or still waiting to make the plunge all I can say is you can do it! Trust me it’s the best decision you will ever make :)"

Has anyone else experienced this? I wondered if it was the erythritol but I googled it and couldn’t find any such issue. Maybe another ingredient?"

keto,There and halfway back again,"It’s been a long while since I posted. About 5 years ago, I gave keto a try and I was dying. I had all kinds of gastro-intestinal distress and hemorrhoids. It was a terrible experience, but for the first time in my life, my hunger was under control.  But I had to leave because I could not take what was happening to me.

In 2019, I was seriously depressed and was sitting at 262 pounds or so (5’5”M).  I knew I had to do something about both.  I researched things and found bupropion (Wellbutrin), which is both an anti-depressant and an appetite suppressant.  I went to the doctor and even before I got there, he did. In a month, I had lost a couple of pounds.  After researching keto again, I decided to give it another try. This time, I had no issues at all. Maybe it was making sure I kept up on keto-ade? Whatever it was, I came back to life, eventually just getting below 200 pounds. 

And then COVID hit. I started drinking more (keto alcoholic beverages), but I found my will power failing.  I got to a point a month ago where I was like half keto or so, but too many binges.  Still, I was pretty happy with myself.

When I went to reorder bupropion, my doctor refused because it had been a while since he saw me. I decided that I was in pretty good shape mentally, and maybe I could just stay off of it.  Well, soon after, I was being pretty good on keto and all of my digestive Issues came back. Over the course of the day I felt like I was blowing up with gas and I could not get rid of it.  Why now?  What was different? I just knew I could not take it anymore.  

Well, turns out that bupropion is also used to treat irritable bowel syndrome. I had noted in the past that fiber killed me on a regular diet, and what do most keto snacks have a lot of? Fiber! So, I had unwittingly not only helped my depression and weight, but IBS by taking bupropion!

Well, I decided to just go back to a normal diet until I could get in to the doctor.  I can honestly say, I don’t like regular food anymore. It doesn’t taste as good as I remember. I became a slave to carbs again.  In a week, my weight that had already been creeping up, shot up. I got rid of the IBS symptoms, but I felt gross in other ways. Besides that, I lost a crown while eating sushi and tried to cut off the tip of my finger while slicing a bagel.

So, back full keto again and just trying to keep the fiber down.  My body was certainly telling me something and it was about time I listened again.  I am not really that unhappy with myself for gaining half the weight back. I know the magic formula, and we can’t be too mad with ourselves in these crazy times. There is a rare verse of “The Boxer” by Simon and Garfunkel that ends with “After changes upon changes we are more or less the same. After changes we are more or less the same.”  Same me, same bad tendencies. I can’t be mad about it, I can just try to be better."

keto,What the hell are fats?,"Okay this is gonna sound like a really dumb question but can someone plsss explain to me what fats do to the body? I know weight gain is simple: I consume more calories than my maintenance level. But when it comes to the quality of food wtf are fats and what do they do to the body. Many people say consuming lots of fat makes you gain fat ?? I’m so confused and also what do proteins do?? I know are refined carbs are bad that’s why I’m on keto. But what do protein and fats do to the body? What role do they play? Why do people say avoid fats in excess amounts ? 

I was at the store today and there was an option to get regular cream cheese or 1/3 less fat cream cheese. They both have the same calories and everything one just has less fat. Please someone explain to me like I’m a kindergartener!!"
keto,Are there any skinny people doing keto ?,"Hi! I hope you guys don’t find this offensive but I’ve noticed that many do keto to lose weight and the people on this subreddit are usually on the bigger end based on the posts that I’ve read. Kudos to you for losing weight. But personally I feel sad when reading those post because I haven’t lost any weight yet and don’t think I’ll see any massive weight lose like you guys. 

I’m 5’8 125 pounds and I’m four days into keto and I feel like shit, very tired all the time. I need so inspiration to stick with it. I want to lose weight as well and get more lean and I’ve heard that the keto diet is the way to go. Anyone else out there that is already skinny and went on keto to get lean?

I started the keto diet almost 2 weeks ago and my recent period is very weird, it’s darker and I have a lower flow. I have made my research and it says that maybe it’s because I’m not reaching a good level of carbs. I don’t eat much, but that’s just how I eat. I would like to know how to solve this or how can I increase my carb levels in a keto way and if anyone have had the same problem."

keto,Discouraged or Work Harder?,"Hey Everyone!
Firstly, on mobile so excuse the formatting. Long time lurker here on r/keto. I am a 29f sw:216 cw:205. I started keto about 4 weeks ago and initially dropped 11 lbs total. Now I’ve been stuck and can’t seem to make any difference in the number on the scale for the past two weeks. I integrated yoga 5x/week for 20 minutes and riding the stationary bike for 30 mins 4x/week. Do you all have any tips on why this could be? I think I maybe have blinders for seeing any change body wise but I just love seeing the difference on the scale. Could I be eating too much of a certain type of food? Or maybe dehydrated? I feel a bit discouraged at this point and am looking for any advice to keep moving along the right path. Do I just need to keep pushing and continuing with keto and exercise?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!! All the encouragement on your own individual journies!"
keto,High BP and Potassium?,"I've been on Keto for about 3 years. 

At first I had an issue of low blood pressure. My body would release the sodium so fast and I was constantly experiencing mood swings.

I would only supplement sodium and magnesium.

Someone told me to supplement potassium too because our body likes to keep them in balance and it worked! My body now holds on to the sodium.

But now I have highish BP(140/90ish). I've never had it before on Keto. The only thing I've done differently was add a lot more potassium to my diet (lots of vegetables plus Lite-Salt).

Should I lower the potassium a bit? I really don't want to stop this diet.

I live close to a Keto doctor, he actually posts a lot of videos on YouTube and seems very knowledgeable. I plan to schedule an appt after the Holidays."
keto,General advice,"M/6’3”/220/39 yo

So I’m coming up on 3 years on Keto. Have lost 65 lbs in that time. I’ve had nights that I have too many IPA’s or eat pizza with my family but it’s not often. Maybe once a month. Outside of that I stay under 30g carbs daily. I exercise about 5 days a week and it consists of a 3 mile run or a P90X upper body resistance workout. I’m usually around 1900 calories per day and IF 16-20 hours 4-5 days a week. 

I have been around 220lbs for at least 6 months and am just soft and loose in around my waist. At my age and lifestyle I’m not trying to gain a 6 pack but any advice on how to drop the loose, jiggly stuff around my midsection. 
Different workouts?
Increase protein?
Just patience?

Any help is appreciated."
keto,The magic feels gone?,"The first week and a half of keto felt like bliss. The very first day was amazing - I did a fast all day long, and I enjoyed what felt like perfect mental clarity without the assistance of caffeine or my ADHD medication. 

I’m about three weeks in now, and it seems like those effects have gone away. During the first week, I’d snap awake after 7 hours of sleep. Now I’m back to sleeping 9 hours and feeling like I need more. I’m back to the mental fog and laziness. I’m back to feeling what I felt like on carbs.

My diet is not perfect. I usually eat eggs and avocado for breakfast, some sort of salad + protein bowl for lunch, and various snacks that tide me over until bedtime (lots of nuts, peanut butter, cheese). I also take electrolyte pills (nowhere near to satisfy the daily amount though). Not sure what else I should be doing. 

How do I get back to that first week of keto? I felt like I scratched the surface to how I could be feeling, and now I’m back in the dumps. What do?"
keto,Why does the Keto diet reduce inflammation?,I'm now on a 6 months keto diet and I finally archived to write black numbers at my asthma test. Also my Immunglobulin E markers went down by 20%. Why is that keto reduces inflammation? Is it because of ketosis itself or because of the food that I'm eating ( or not eating )
keto,BAD ANXIETY with KETO... what else could I be missing?,"I'm starting to think this is a personal brain chemistry thing as I've covered, experimented, and trialed numerous numerous times:

-correct electrolyte dosing 
-have tried tons of other supplements
-plenty of sleep
-plenty of H20 but not overdoing it
-have been well past any keto flu, carb withdrawal, or induction periods many times now
-have done every coping mechanism there is (exercise, meditation, journaling, therapy etc.) trust me if it exists I've done or do it regularly
-eliminate caffeine

There is no real external stressors in my life right now. As my job is pretty mundane. Keto I thought is suppose to help anxiety not make it worse.

Any detectives out there 🤔"
keto,What's Possible,"I've been stressed the last couple weeks, because the goal I set for myself- to be under 200 pounds by the New Year, looks iffy. I'm 210 now. My weight loss has slowed down. Losing 11 pounds in 5 and a half-ish weeks is possible, but only if I tow the line exactly with my eating, don't have any holiday slips, keep being more active and well, honestly, get a little lucky. 

And the uncertainty about whether I'll make is has gotten me down a little, because mentally, crossing that barrier before next year is symbolically important. And yet, September  8th- almost exactly 2.5 months ago, I weighed 244 pounds.  I have lost 34 pounds in less than three months. I have gone from Class 3 obesity to 1 pound away from Class 1. One more pound and goodbye morbid obesity. Eep. I have become happier, more active, more hopeful, and it's been so little time, and honestly, so little effort. I have had exactly zero moments of misery or hunger. I have had some moments of minor discomfort, when it comes to moving my body again, for the first time in ages. But the good kind of discomfort that says ""About damn time."" 

I may not make it to under 200 pounds by 2021. I'm still going to try.  But I'm going to let go of the stress about it, because I will certainly get there. Even if I just miss it- whether I'm 202 or 198, I will be within spitting distance of losing 50 lbs, something unfathomable just months ago. And in less than four months. That's unreal.

I appreciate I am the world's most impatient person. That my weight loss has been fantastic. That the way I feel, both physically and mentally is even better. Here's to goals, and knowing that even if you don't quite hit them, you're still that much closer to accomplishing everything that matters."
keto,Stink,"I'm 5 years keeping Keto and I have now a new problem, I'm stinking my body odor smells like acetone, and sometimes like ammonia. Is disturbing. I don't know if is related to some soy or potatoes I ate but is been weeks and I still stink. I didn't went really out of my macros, I just sacrificed my daily carbs to  some fries, and for a while I ate Kebab-boxes instead of home meals as OMAD.

In other news I lost the pandemic kgs. and have a marked stomach with almost no exercise. It kinda looks worse? But I'm so close to a proper 6 pack. Are this related? like the stink and the weight lose? 

I feel bad for the people in my surroundings. As my body odor all over is worse I bought more deodorant, I'm  showering myself more, going to the job by public transport so I don't arrive sweated, and taking probiotics bc I think even my farts are worse. I'm super ashamed of stinking."
keto,"New guy here, just checking in.","On mobile, forgive the formatting.

Ive been lurking for a while now, and I finally want to speak up. 

I am 340 lbs. Like other people, I have been overweight the majority of my life. I was bullied, I ate, gained weight, bullied more, ate more gained more, blah blah blah, you know the story. I have tried multiple diets, sometimes I would lose weight, every time I would quit because some reason or excuse. 

Stress and anxiety are my biggest triggers that I use as an excuse to binge eat. I have never told anyone that I have a problem with binge eating. I don’t think I have ever admitted to myself that I had an issue with it either. I just assumed I like to eat and I like to use food to comfort me when I am stressed. 

Before Covid I had lost 70 pounds and due to me allowing stress from it and another major stressor in my life, I have gained almost every bit of it back.

Something has to change.

I am going to start Keto because nothing has worked for me in the past. I am very nervous because this is new and there is a lot to learn and figure out. I will be asking lots of questions, so please bear with me. 

What I hope to gain from this post is merely support and accountability, as I feel like that is what I need the most to succeed. Thanks for reading."
keto,Sick from carbs,"After doing keto for the past two months (lost around 16 pounds), I decided to stop a few days ago for a variety of reasons. 

The past two days I have been loading up on all the carby foods that I missed, and boy do I ever feel horrible. The most noticeable difference is my energy levels, a few hours after dinner I feel like I am hit by freight train and fall asleep due my exhaustion. My heart burn is back and my digestion issues are back as well (spent the last two mornings on the toilet). In general I am feeling very low energy and lazy.

I didn't realize how good I felt while doing keto until stopping and realizing how bad I feel now.

Has anyone else experienced something similar to this after stopping/taking a break from keto?"
keto,Fat macros,"What would be the minimum fat macros you could consume while still staying in ketosis? I’m 80kg 171cm eating 1000-1200 cals per day and currently eating 100grams fat, 20grams carbs and 100grams protein.

keto,Is there a limit to how many total carbs I can eat without going over 20 net carbs?,I easily stay under 20 net carbs a day and to be honest I have no problem staying under 10 but I do eat about 35 total carbs (mostly fiber) but recently I’ve found this “zero sugar” soda at Whole Foods called virgils soda. The sweeteners are stevia erthryritol and monk fruit extract so that’s usually what brings me to 35 total carbs a day so will 35 total carbs 10 net carbs kick me out?
keto,"Losing hope, hanging on by a thread :(","Hey keto fam, a bit of a long one. I joined the keto fam about 2 and a half years ago in April 2018 and it changed my life for the better. I was **102.6 KG( 226lb)** when I started and lost a lot of weight, with out much effort tbh, I did lazy keto, and walked daily to and fro the train station for work. By July, I was 14 kg lighter, and weighed 86 kg(189 lb). I hadn't felt that confident since 2009, it was crazy, my mental health was amazing, I was going on hikes?? such a foreign concept to me at the time lol. It was a whirlwind of happiness and glee, I was on a complete high.

I went through a LOT of trauma in late 2018, and 2019. I unfortunately relapsed and returned to my emotional/binge eating habits for comfort. I loved carbs, and carbs hated me. I now currently weigh 120kg (264 lb). I've put on more than I lost initially, so since september 2018, I've put on a total of 30KG!!!(70lb). I'm of quite a short stature, so I literally look like a sphere now, I am so incredibly depressed and just want to better myself, but each time I try to get back on keto, I fail. I have tried ENDLESS times. The foods I so greatly enjoyed in 2018, just don't taste the same, they almost make me feel sick. I'm not sure why. so, I'm pleading, if you have any tips for perhaps a more nutritional keto diet, or just some inspo to keep me going, I would so greatly appreciate it. I'm really struggling, mentally and physically. It's so difficult knowing that I can better myself, but not having the motivation or will power to do so :(

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR Tried Keto 2 years ago, did wonders. Want to start again, but need a resurgence of inspo/ motivation.

keto,"Hi everyone,","Doing keto for the first time! Very new to it and have a lot of questions, would really appreciate any advice or sharing of experience.
I started doing keto about a month ago. I coupled it with intermittent fasting. The first two weeks were great, but on week 3 I started having upper stomach pain. So I stopped doing intermittent fasting but stuck with keto. Now after a week, the stomach ache has subsided but i started having dull headaches usually affecting one side of my head at night. I’ve been sorta managing them with otc tension headache meds, but this morning I was stretching while sleeping and I woke up with searing pain on one side of my head. It was throbbing and painful and seemed to be originating somewhere between my left eye and forehead. I took otc meds again which seemed to dull it a bit but my head and neck feel so sore. 
About me I’m 34 year old woman. Recently took up cycling and wonder if this is all an exertion headache thing or if I’m lacking vitamins or minerals? 
Has anyone else dealt with headaches like this on keto? What helped?"
keto,Need advice!,"Okay. So I have been going back
And forth between calories and macros
For months. I looked at my history and I was eating like 1800-2000 on average an on good days like 1600. So I'm starting again today and I'm actually going to monitor closely what I eat. I'm down 20lbs but I'm stuck. Anyone know a good macro calculator ? Ever site says something diff. The app I have says I should be eating sedentary 1500 (I work out 5-6xs a week but I'm sitting all day.) I just want to figure it out and stick to it because I want the rest of my weight gone in a year.
😩 and do you guys pay close attn to macros?"
keto,My ACV tonic makes me hungry,"Been Keto for about a month and a half.  Fat adapted, hunger and cravings are very rare and never strong.  This delicious tonic leaves me very hungry, like a very empty stomach.

Top 3 ingredients I used to drink straight and never had a problem.   2 tbsp acv, 1 tbsp each of lemon and lime juice.  Recently I made it a robust drink adding about a 1/4 cup of flavored seltzer, about 1/2 a cup of water water, couple pinches ground pink him salt, like 12 drops of monk fruit extract.  

Almost immediately I start to feel uncomfortable in the belly like strong hunger.  I drank this tonic at 7 am and now 3 hours later the craving never let up even after drinking water.  

Last thing I ate last night (8pm) was 2 slices of bacon, about a tbsp of natural peanutbutter, coffee with butter, heavy cream, cinnamon, tbsp mct oil.

keto,Ketoversaries and Celebrations,"4 years and one week.  1468 days.  That's how long it has been since I was completely hopeless.  Lost.  That's how long it has been since I was ashamed about myself.  I wasn't living but was instead only existing.  Eating, sleeping, working, pooping.  Existing but not living.       
       
Hello newbies and lurkers.  Reading post after post hoping to find that ONE spark that will give you the jump start needed.  Not sure if keto is for you.  Not sure if you are ready.  Not sure it you are capable.  Not sure not sure not sure!!!!!!    
    
I love ketoversaries.  For me, they are now my real BIRTHDAY.  They are now the real day I began to live.  November 14 is the day I really enjoy celebrating.  Pretty fitting that it is so close to Thanksgiving.  Fitting on so many levels.  Thankful that I started eating keto.  Thankful that keto works for me.  Thankful that I'm alive.     
    
1468 days ago, I was a dead man.    
   
Today, I'm the luckiest man alive.     
   
Not sure, not sure, not sure.  Newbies and lurkers, I understand.  These keto waters look dark.  The water looks deep.  The water looks cold.  Rest assured, the water is calm.  The water is warm.  The water will cleanse you.      
       
My perspective on life is certainly different than most.  Having been completely hopeless is a blessing in some respects because I now find joy in the smallest things.  And my fourth year of eating keto was full of blessings.    
        
I hiked through the Garden of the Gods.  I stood on the edge of the world holding the woman I love while watching the sun set.  I was taught how to play poker by a poodle.  I lost friends and family.  I gained some friends and family.      
         
I cooked a meal that was so good, Lady Texas took three bites, looked at me and said, ""Damn"".  One of my dear r/keto friends got married.  Another one is struggling and I wish he knew that I would move the world to help him.  In the past year, I have asked, ""how much sodium and potassium did you eat/drink yesterday?"" about 5000 times.  A couple of hundred ""yehaws"" have been posted and I have been a part of a subreddit that is saving people's lives.    
     
Including my own.    
                           
Newbies and lurkers, close your eyes.  Close your eyes and think what you will be doing 4 years from today.  Pick something.  Disney world.  Dancing.  Hugging your kids.      
          
I bet you a million dollars you do not imagine yourself wearing a mustard stained shirt and holding a half eaten hot dog.     
         
Happier and healthier.  I hope to hell that's how you imagined yourself.  Your mental image of yourself.  Because you are in the right place.  You are reading the right sub.  Hit that subscribe button and do this:  Eat fewer than 20 grams of net carbs.  That will get you into ketosis.  Eat at a 20% caloric deficit.  That will get you losing weight.   
     
Do those two things, and you will get healthier.  
                 
And start living your life.  Don't wait.  DON'T WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      
    
My fourth year of keto was FANTASTIC.  I tore my right meniscus.  I partially tore my left meniscus.  I have learned how to spell meniscus.  I have lost a job.  I got photobombed by a sea lion and I almost kissed a shark.  I kissed a beautiful woman.    
     
I stood before the space shuttle Endeavor and felt a tearful humility.  I thought my Mom was going to pass only to have her get healthier.  I lost a cousin to Covid making me the patriarch of my family.      
      
I started my fourth year in Louisiana, lived in Los Angeles, and got back to Texas.  I have driven state line to state line across Texas and all along the North/South backbone of Texas.  I caught my biggest fish ever.  Holding Lady Texas while standing in the Pacific Ocean to fishing the Gulf of Mexico--The BigTex version of ""sea to shining sea"".    
       
Newbies and lurkers, you have been reading a post by a fat man on r/keto and yet I have not written about losing weight.  I am more than a number.  I am 54 years old yet I am more than a number.  And you are sitting there not sure if you want to start.     
       
Scared.  Worried.  Looking down at those keto waters.  Afraid to jump.     
          
Close your eyes.  Take a deep breath.  Start running.  And dive in.       
               
Dive in to your new life.  A new life that is healthier.  Full of happiness.  Full of sadness.  A life full of joy.  A life full challenges.  What's your sea to shining sea?  Can you stand on the edge of the world?      
       
Screw the scale.  Eat keto at a 20% deficit and that stuff will happen, so screw the scale.  From this point on, success is measured by laughter and tears.  Success is measured by joys and frustrations.  Success is measured by the excitement you feel.  The excitement you create.  You have an opportunity to wake up every damn day with a heart full of excitement.  A heart full of hope.  A heart full of joy.      
         
The scale cannot steal those things from me.  They cannot be stolen from you.        
      
Hello Newbies and Lurkers, I am Brian.  I begin this fifth year of keto full of excitement.  Full of hopes.  Brimming with joy.  Nervous, but the good kind of nervous.  Different than the kind of nervous you are feeling.  You're nervous because you are uncertain of keto.  I am nervous because I might waste tomorrow.         
      
We will not allow our nerves to dissuade us.  We will not allow our nerves to hold us back.  Inside of us is a world full of hopes and dreams.  Those hopes and dreams may be trapped in fat but they are inside of us.  Ready to burst forth.
                   
Take my hand, take a deep breath and jump.  Dive in with me.  The water is warm.

keto,Should I be eating more on workout days?,"M/5’7/327

I’ve worked out 3 or 4 times this week 3 of them were super intense cardio sessions today was a quick 30 min session of weights. I’m in terrible shape but I can do a lot for my BMI. the days I’ve worked out I’ve basically eaten no more than 600+ my BMR. My Apple Watch tracked yesterday’s workouts for 1010 burned. Then i subtract 25% from that since fitness tracking watches are wildly inaccurate. I don’t want to go into starvation mode but I also don’t know which formula I should use.

Should I:

1. Keep eating my calorie deficit goal and keep working out?

2. Keep working out and eat my BMR?

3. Eat a surplus only on days i workout? (If so how much of a surplus?)

4. Use a calorie calculator, factor in workouts and then use that as my new calorie goals? (Albeit I would eating a surplus of my current goals on a daily basis + I don’t like counting for something that I haven’t done yet.)

Any other suggestions feel free."
keto,Am I doing this correctly?,"
Some background:
21; 5’9 (69 inches); 16 inch neck; 38 inch waist 187lbs
My metabolism also isn’t the best, unfortunately.

I started keto about 2 - 3 weeks ago &amp; have been following all the fundamentals to the T. I work out about 4-5 times a week - mostly weight lifting, little cardio here and there. My diet has been consisting of mostly chicken, eggs, bacon, unsalted butter and ground beef. I try to stay under 1200 calories a day (successfully so far) and strictly eat 1 meal a day at around lunch. I drink about 60 - 70 oz of water a day. 

So basically, i started off at 200-205 lbs and I’m currently at 187. The progress has shown but I’m frustrated because I’ve fluctuating these past couple of days despite trying my best to do everything right. This past week, my average weight was 183-185 and as of 9 am this morning I was sitting at 179 but after eating a light keto meal at lunch, drinking 60ozs of water, &amp; hitting the gym I’m sitting at 187lbs (currently 9pm). This is very frustrating &amp; wanted to know if it is normal &amp; if I just have to keep restricting my caloric intake. The fatigue from eating 1200 is killing me."

My problem is, as much as I am not proud to say it, is that Im a functional alcoholic. I was able to cut it down to 2-3 times a week (i get blackout drunk everytime). But recently I had a rough patch and am now drinking nearly everyday. I drink brandy as I think beer was the #1 factor of my weight gain before. But although Im drinking hard liquor, I noticed that I still bloat up when im drinking a lot. 

I was just wondering if this is kicking me out of ketosis or if alcohol really just bloats you up? Also, anyone here whos struggled with this? I know i should address my drinking problem but when you're living alone, miles away from friends and family bc of work in the middle of this pandemic it's kinda hard to find other hobbies to spend my time on ._."

I was allowed to bring my own food in and prepared my food for under 20g of carbs. However, I obviously can’t go throughout the rest of the day without eating anything. If I go over 20g carbs now, will I be kicked out of ketosis? Does it have to do with your sleep cycle or is it really just 20g of carbs every 24 hours?

I'd like to follow a 10/45/45 split, at around 1880 calories. That puts me at about 220g of protein or so, looking at my app. Is that fine? It's almost double the upper limit I see recommended here?

I've done keto/low carb many times throughout the years. I remember doing it when it first gained notoriety in 03/04. There is always an event that ruins my momentum.

keto,30 Pounds Down in 2 Months,"[https://imgur.com/gallery/pLFrUuy](https://imgur.com/gallery/pLFrUuy)

Hey r/keto! Posting a 2 month update to my keto weight loss journey. 

# Context
I was a hobbyist bodybuilder from 2017 to 2019, and weighed around 160 pounds at &lt;10% bodyfat. I ""knew"" how to lose weight, just eat less and move more! Right? In late 2019 I developed an addiction to carbohydrates, gained 40 pounds in 12 months, and attempt after attempt to lose weight the traditional way never worked. (Obligatory) Everything in this post is my story and not a recommendation. I am not a doctor nor a nutritionist, just some guy on the internet posting my opinions!

# Story
I decided to fast for 2 days to try to break my addiction to carbs and binge eating. On September 19, 2020 I began a 50 hour water fast. Surprisingly, this actually seemed to kick my carb addiction, and I lost around 10 pounds off the bat. I suspect this was almost all water weight, with maybe a pound or two of fat. I entered ketosis at around the 24 hour mark iirc.

Once my fast was over, I decided I would go ketogenic. I knew a lot about the diet, however never did it seriously, since I had success with standard calorie cutting in the past. I didn't intend to do this before my fast, but it just made sense to go keto since over the period of the fast I realized I wasn't addicted to food, but carbs in particular. I looked up ""5 Ingredient Keto Recipes"", and just started making a bunch of them. The food was amazing so it was easy to stick to. I wasn't counting calories at this point, but I estimate I was eating somewhere around 1500-2000 a day.

By the time October came around, I was eating less because I was just always full. It was around this time that I started OMAD (one meal a day). Again, this wasn't really planned, I just couldn't eat when I normally would because I didn't want to. For me, that's the beauty of keto. I understand the theory about lower insulin leading to more fat loss, but at the end of day if I had to guess I think most of my weight loss has really come from my satiation from eating so much fat.

# Thoughts
So overall, seems like Keto + OMAD is what works for me. I have absolutely cheated, so I haven't been the strictest when it comes to no carbs, but I try to only do this every two weeks when I do my refeeding days.

keto,Rage Against the (Keto) Machine,"I know this has been covered in other posts, so bear with me. I have been dealing with some major keto rage lately. It seems like everything is a trigger for setting me off! I've been finding that I've been having pretty severe mood swings, and have been getting irrationally angry /weepy/manic. Everything that I have read states that this is completely normal for those in the early phases of their keto journey, especially if they were living a high carb lifestyle before starting keto (uh, yeah... guilty!)

keto,Iron Infusions and Ketosis,"Hello! I’ve been successfully doing keto since 9/1. I’ve lost 32.6 lbs and feel much better. I’m still about 60 lbs from my goal weight and plan to continue keto.

Macros: &lt;1250 cals, 93g fat, 75g protein, &lt;23g net carbs a day. I use Carb Manager app to track. 

I had to start iron infusions in March for severe iron-deficient anemia. I’ve recently been switched to 300mg iron dextran (INFeD brand here in the US) from Injectafor every 3 months for IV infusion. I was wondering if anyone knew if this infusion would throw me out of ketosis?? I can’t find too much information about the dextran part, though I know it’s somehow related to glucose. 
Any insight would be appreciated!! Thanks!"
keto,Quick update,"So I bought a few of the premier protein shakes but long term it’s going to be a bit much on my wallet (grocery store was selling them for 4 pack at 10$). I am going to do some research into protein powders cause I think I can sustain that Wallet wise a bit better. 

I am also going to start buying cans of tuna to help between meals. I know ya’ll are saying I need to eat more but jumping from where I am at to where I need to be isn’t going to happen over night. 

I am going to start actually utilizing my resistance bands at home, it’s probably going to feel like a huge chore for me but I will see where I am in that regard in another 2-3 weeks.

I’ll apologize for being a biiitttt grumpy last night I was sleep starved and had been up for 12+ hours due to work."
keto,The Keto diet has been called a “miracle cure all”...,"The Keto diet has been called a “miracle cure all”...

All because of the ketogenic diet’s benefits:

1. Excess fat (especially around the belly) quickly melting off....
2. Gaining a *ton* more energy that most adults forget is even possible...
3. All while eating *more* delicious foods than ever before...
4. Without suffering from constant hunger
5. And without craving sugar, or other unhealthy foods like with most diets.

Thousands of people, including celebrities like Gywnneth Paltrow, Halle Berry, Kourtney and Kim Kardashian, and Megan Fox, swear by the benefits of the Keto diet.

**Ordinary women, even moms of four kids are seeing themselves shocked at their before and after pictures…** 

*Fitting into jeans they haven’t worn in decades, and having their doctors shocked at their new healthy numbers.*

And that’s because the keto diet puts your body into a state of ketosis. 

This means your body uses its own fat as fuel.

Most people have their bodies programmed to use sugar as fuel...

But when you’re in ketosis and your body uses fat for fuel, that’s when you can experience:

1. All-day, beaming energy
2. Your mood and happiness bouncing back up
3. Clearer, smoother skin
4. Snapping out of brain and mental fogginess
5. Excess weight practically melting off your trouble areas
6. Your libido reawakening, roaring back to life

The problem is, Keto can get complicated quickly.

People don’t know what to eat on Keto… 

If done incorrectly, they can stall and get discouraged…

And they can be overwhelmed by the calculat"

keto,Face gains from 125 kg to 110 kg,"[https://imgur.com/NEnQWt2](https://imgur.com/NEnQWt2)

It was in August when i stood on the weighting scale and thought this is enough i have to do something the scale showed me 125 kg(275,578 lbs) and that while i don't eat much or much junk.

&amp;#x200B;

At that moment i decided that i wanted/needed to lose 20kg(+/- 44lb) by the end of the year. At the same moment i also decided that i would try keto for a month to see if it would help me. Spoiler it does help me and that month was extended. I don't think i will make it to the 20 kg but i lost 15kg (33lbs) so far and people tell me you can really see it in my face so i thought i would post a before and now picture. For my feeling i don't see that much yet but the scale does not lie, also i reached the last hole in my belt (in the right direction)

Of course i do it in combination with going to the gym but the 4 time per weeks is almost impossible because the gym is booked full from 6am till 11pm. 

I had hoped keto would also help with my psoriasis as it is an autoimmune disease however unfortunately for me it had no effect on that. 

So still a long way to go, the first 20kg was an intentional high goal but it was only my first goal to get things starting i hope next year to lose much more. As accordingly to my fitness app i should be about 75 kg (165.347 lbs) which seems a bit little but i will keep going as long as i still feel healthy and i think i have the right weight for my body type

keto,Husband struggling,"My husband and I started keto this week (Tuesday for me and Wednesday for him). I used a keto calculator and because our requirements were almost the same, we are eating the same amount.

I'm pretty sure I started ketosis yesterday as I am not hungry anymore and I have more energy. I've done this multiple times before and each time it gets easier.

My husband is struggling and this is his first time doing this. He has a lot of fatigue and irritability which I know is normal but he has a hollow feeling in his stomach also that's making him feel very sick.

He's 5ft 6 and 154lbs and fairly sedentary. I'm aiming for 25g carb, 90g protein, 112g fat and 1470 calories. 

Should I be changing this? It's what the calculator said was right for him. Or is it just a case of getting through it and if so what helps?"
keto,To much salt?,"How do you know you if you use too much salt? I am 5 months on keto now and have been supplementing magnesium and kalium ever since. In addition I put a fair amount of himalayan salt on my three meals per day. I mainly eat veggies together with chickenbreast, cheese and avocado.

Lately I've noticed that the food tastes increasingly salty to me. I don't recall this from the time I started keto.
Is this a sign I should lower my salt intake? And how do I know if I'd take too much?
Thanks for your thoughts!"

I've done keto earlier in the year and had success with it, happily lost 20 kilograms, but then I stopped the diet because it was too expensive. I haven't had much success finding an alternative so far, and I would like to go back to keto.

I've heard that One Meal a Day intermitent fasting dropped down the macros you're supposed to consume each day, is that a thing ? That would solve my price problems, I'm comfortable with fasting.

My current macros going off the calculator are 1522kcal (108p, 24c, 111f), do I divide it if I'm doing OMAD ? That sounds a little weird, I'm not sure how that would work, so if anyone can explain that would be great.

keto,Shift workers,"Hi all 
First time poster
I’ve done Keto on off for the past 2 years frequently quitting due to inadequate preparation and procrastination. 
I’ve managed to stay consistent for a month now. 
My job means I frequently do long shifts where I start and finish late. 
My problem is night shifts - i will have a meal at home before my shift which starts at 8pm. Then I will bring a meal in to have at around 1am. 

HOWEVER throughout the night  I get intense cravings for sweets and treats and it peaks at about 3-5am. It requires a lot of willpower and distraction to power through - but I can see myself succumbing to it if I am tired/busy/feeling low. 
I understand meal prepping is vital (which is very tough due to tiredness/long shifts, but I am getting better at this) 
Does anyone have any tips/tricks/explanations that could help me? 
Thank you all!"

keto,Motivation trouble after a week off,"So it was my birthday last week and I went away for a couple days with my bf. It was lovely. We rented a little cabin in the woods for a few nights, did some hiking, watched Netflix by the fire. It was a nice break. As it was a break, I didn’t feel like cooking and so went haaaard off the keto. Other things I’m sure contributed to that decision tho. The non-keto continued after the trip when I had a couple other small bday dinners during the week. Man, I ate anything and everything I wanted. i ate all my favorite carby stuff! Bagels and pizza and fried chicken and cereal and cookies etc etc. I was also soooo bloated and constipated the whole time. I’m still not back to normal. My body apparently HATES that stuff and made my gut miserable.

So now I’m on day 2 back at it and I’m having some serious motivation issues. When im in the midst of keto, temptations don’t bother me. The cravings and urges are mostly gone and the results are so great, I’m so motivated not to cheat. Now, all the carbs are calling to me. From the ease of eating carbs to the emotional stress eating I want to do to their pure deliciousness. I know it’ll pass and eventually I’ll get back in the swing of things, but damn I forgot how much it can suck at first! I’ve slowly lost 30ish lbs over the last 8 months or so (tho I am NOT weighing myself anytime soon as I don’t want know the damage I’ve done this last week) and have another 25lb or so to go. 

Ughhhhh this sucks. Thanks for letting me vent fellow ketoers!! :)"
keto,0 Carb Ranch Dressing?,"I eat a lot of salads, I calced it out, my salad is roughly 3-4 carbs when made for a big filling salad. When I add ranch I go up to 10 carbs for a salad. It's driving me crazy. I like Ranch and I don't really like other dressings. The only one I can find that is actually 0 carb are 2 different ones, one of which is dairy free, which to me defeats the purpose, Ranch is meant to be creamy. The other one is 0 carb, 0 fat, 0 everything, I tried it, it's also 0 flavor. Only tastes of herby vinegar.

I am looking for a full fat, creamy, dairy based ranch dressing that is 0 carbs and not homemade. I work a lot and have to prep a LOT of my food to be successful on keto, I am not looking for more things to prep."

keto,"So I am plateauing and feel like I am gaining some back, suggestions?","I don’t weigh myself, but I do tape. I work out 5 days a week and try to alternate between running and jogging. 

I am at about 15 or less grams of carbs, averaging at about 30-50 grams of protein and probably about 40 grams of fat. This is mostly averaging the past few days because I don’t always eat the same thing. I do IF, like I eat dinner at about 5-7 pm and I don’t eat anything else till 5-7 pm the next day, so I kinda do daily 24 hour fasts? 

I’m aiming to drink 3 bottles of water per day during the work day, but I am on my feet all day and constantly moving so it’s kinda difficult. I want to try a water fast on the weekends when I kinda veg on the couch cause those are my rest days.

Some days I go down to 1100kcal too, which is meant to be a huge cut, but somehow over the past week I haven't even lost a 100grams (0.2lbs). I measure every day in the morning, a week ago I was 69.4, and now I am actually 69.5.

Then it stopped. I went about 4 months without losing, and then started gaining weight on keto. Is it at all possible that this is the reason I stopped losing weight? I was still in ketosis per my blood readings, just wasn’t losing weight. I also did start watching calories and macros closely during that time in hopes that something was off, but I was as close to perfect as a human can get.

I’m currently looking into other alternatives foe weight loss but I’m curious if anyone else has experienced something similar. I loved keto and the way I felt while eating this way, but when I started to gain weight again I gave up. I only recently realized it could have been my contraceptive."

keto,Six months in. 81lbs/36.7kg/5.8stone down.,"[Progress photo](https://i.imgur.com/Uyoa4lQ.jpg)

Hey keto squad.

I posted an update here a few months ago with my progress, and promised a couple of people I'd post again when I got further into it.

Next week marks six months of keto life for myself. I allowed myself one cheat weekend in the summer where we went away, and all I did was drink beer and eat at restaurants. Gained 4lbs and lost it in three days.

As of today, I'm 219lbs, down from a bang-on 300lbs when I started in late May.

I want to thank everybody in this community for their helpful posts, amazing tips, and general warmth towards everyone embarking on their own keto journey. I don't comment at all, but I lurk like there's no tomorrow, and you're all diamonds.

The last six months have changed my life, and I think it's fair to say I'm going to be comfortable living with a low-carb diet for the foreseeable future. I used to disregard people saying 'it's not a diet, it's a lifestyle.' But trust me, it's a goddamn lifestyle, and a great one at that.

Bless you all. Thank you for the love. It means the world."
keto,Does keto really make weight loss faster?,"Let me first start by saying I'm in this purely for the weight loss, because I know a lot of people do keto for the health benefits.        

My mission is to lose weight the fastest way possible while still making sure I'm doing it in a healthy manner so I don't ruin my body and gain it all back. So I recently started keto and I hate it, cooking all these foods takes up so much time and its giving me a lot of stress, not to mention the food itself is boring, bland, and very limited.          

Would I get the same results in the same time frame if I were to just eat whatever I wanted and keep in a calorie deficit? (I know I'll lose weight no matter what as long as I stay in a deficit, my question is does keto make it faster.)"

The ingredients look good - Almonds, Flax Seeds, Psyllium Husk, Apple Cider Vinegar, Egg Whites, Salt, Water and Baking Powder - and this bread is actually really, really tasty. Like, I would eat this bread even if I were not on keto! The extra fiber is also really good in the digestion department. It toasts up well and stays fresh in the freezer. I thought I had found the miracle keto food when I first ordered it! So good.

However, ever since I started incorporating it into my diet, the scale has been going the wrong way. It may be other stuff as I have only loosely been tracking calories and need to get back to counting and weighing everything but I'm wondering if anyone else has used this bread and found a similar experience. To be clear - I am still going to keep using this bread because I love it but I'm wondering if maybe I should adjust net carbs when I track it... I'm sure it's just a matter of me being lazy with my macros but wanted to ask around."
keto,Why can't I lose weight?,"I've reduced my carbs below 20 gm for a few days now and I haven't lost weight not even the initial water weight. I don't even think I'm in ketosis as I don't have that ketone breath like I did when I did the diet several times before. This time keto isn't working. I lost a lot of weight 4 months ago by going on a liquid diet for a month. Does this have anything to do with the reason I'm not losing weight? Something to do with starvation mode? But the folks over at r/nutrition say that starvation mode is a myth?

keto,[NSV] I didn't eat the leftovers.,"Hey y'all,

I just needed a place to share this small victory. I'm new here on this account, but I tried keto about seven years ago. I was successful for a month, but sadly, I fell off the wagon.

Since then, I've gone through a lot of life changes and my weight &amp; eating habits got completely out of control. I haven't even attempted to address this or change my diet because I felt I was a lost cause -- especially once I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism.

Then, a couple of weeks ago, I got fed up. I was at the highest weight I've ever been at; my body ached every morning; standing at the stove to cook dinner killed my back; all my friends are either married or in committed relationships while I'm too self-conscious about my body to pursue dating. Since keto was the only diet I'd ever adhered to with success, I decided to give it another go.

I'm down 9 lbs. But more importantly, my hunger and desire to eat no longer feels out of my control. I really noticed it last night.

Whenever I'd cook a meal in the past seven years, I'd always make wayyyy too much. So, I'd throw the leftovers in the fridge and tell myself it'd be my lunch tomorrow. 

That was wishful thinking. I'd *always* inevitably eat the leftovers later that night -- if not directly after the meal.

Last night, I made a double portion of my dinner and put the extras in the fridge, which is where it stayed until this afternoon. I was barely tempted to dig into it. (I think any temptation I *did* have was born from habit and not actual hunger, so I knew it would pass if I just pushed through it.) This is the first time I've done this in years.

I am so excited to continue this journey. I'm excited to beat back more bad habits and have more personal epiphanies. This time feels very different. I am ready to do this."

I started a law degree this year and up until recently, I was struggling big time with focus and motivation but thanks to keto, I literally just spent the entire day with my head in the book, dishing out the guts of an entire essay. I couldn't have imagined doing that in my younger years, nevermind now. 

I feel so lucky to have found this diet, it's digging me out of a real mental hole and I'm so grateful. 

The weight loss isnt too bad either, I guess. 14 pounds down now in less than 6 weeks. I'm hoping for another 12 before Christmas and then on to 2021 full speed ahead."
keto,Found maybe the best way to get potassium during Keto.,"I had been looking for good way to potassium in my diet as it helps regulate your water intake as well as a host of other benefits. 

 Scouring the internet the only low carb foods I found that I could eat and get enough Potassium was Avocado and Almonds,  but even those are less than 10% of the daily value.

Anyway, not to make this a long story but I was starving on a long drive and I stopped at a gas station to try and find something keto friendly when think I found the holy grail of potassium on this diet.  Muscle Milk

I'm not sponsored in anyway but this stuff has 970mg of potassium With only 3 net carbs.  Compared to the almonds I eat which has 190mg for 2 net carbs.  Its expensive for sure but if you guys have a better way to get enough potassium without eating 8 avocados a day Id love to know."

keto,Facing some health issues after doing almost 0 carb for a month and a half.,"Hi,

I've been doing keto on and off for some time, never eating junk food but not very strict either (almonds here and there, cheese, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

So, since I hit a wall (34M, 1.7m, 80kgs, muscular but some fat to lose), I decided to do strict keto, I have no issues with discipline when it comes to eating, so this was my day meal, 7 days a week:

&amp;#x200B;

\- lunch: 2 homemade burgers + 2 scrambled eggs, plenty of butter.

\- dinner: 2-3 homemade burgers + chimichurri (spices on vinagre and olive oil)

&amp;#x200B;

I did that for a month and a half, while exercising (gym, mostly weight lifting), and I was feeling great, even my training was getting better than before, gaining strength, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

But.. there is a but. After around a month and a half, I started to feel like absolute shit, symtomps:

\- problems to sleep

\- waking up tired

\- very low energy during the day

\- every time I ate something, I felt lethargic as fuck, sometimes I had to take a nap

\- developed dark circles under my eyes, never had those before in my life, I can even feel them hurt sometimes after eating.. crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I stopped. People said the problem was electrolyte imbalance, so I started focusing on that, plenty of magnesium, potassium, sodium, etc, from diet and supplemented. Also vitamin D, zinc, etc Nothing changed. It's been 2 months now.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I broke something in my organism, can't get out of this cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I did notice great improvements while lowering my body fat percentage and at the same time my training sessions were really good, right now I don't have the energy to take out the garbage bag...

&amp;#x200B;

So... I do have health insurance, so I will order some tests I guess, but I wanted to post here because maybe someone went through the same issues, or at least someone knows what kind of tests I should perform, since the medicine system here is quite conventional, no doctors even know what keto means.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading the wall of text."

keto,Faster fat adaptation,"Hi /keto, first time posting. I started strict healthy keto 3 days ago, mostly for the endurance / cognitive benefits. From what i can gather it seems to take between 2 and 4 weeks to become fat adapted, however, leading up to keto I have been using IF on a 16 / 8 schedule and doing a good amount of fasted cardio every morning (5 - 7k runs).

What are your thoughts on how this will affect my fat adaptation process?"

I am 34 years old male with 181 cm height who started keto in May 2020 at 113 kg. I have reduced a significant amount of weight (26 kgs) since then. I have had 3 cheat days in between, gained some weight and lost it again.
 Around 4 days back I started having numbness and kind of a heavy feeling in the thumb and index finger of my left hand. On the same time I am also having pain in the left side of my neck, shoulder blade. This pain runs down in the left hand. I took this pain as some pain related to incorrect sleeping posture but it is not going away. I am worried about the numbness in fingers more. I have been taking Vit B-complex, magnesium, calcium and zinc supplements.
 Please help. (Or suggest what kind of a doctor I should see)
 P.s. I am from India and not many doctors are completely aware about keto here."
keto,2nd Round Problems,I’m doing Keto for the second time after a few years break and I’ve run into an issue this time around that I don’t remember happening the first time. This must be too much to share but every time I eat my organic hamburger patty with bacon and cheese I get the runs bad. Few hours later after eating without a warning I have to go immediately ASAP. ( I do take multivitamins and fiber powder if this info helps in anyway). Is this normal? Will this go away eventually? I know Joe Rogan had a similar issue for a bit but he was strictly only eating meat.
keto,Ketosis gives me angular chelitis (dry cracked corner of mouth) and I don’t understand why,"I have stopped and started a strict Keto diet probably 6 times in 3 years. Every single time I start keto, within days I have a horrible case of Angular Chelitis.  I had heard this could be from a lack of B Vitamins but I have been taking a prenatal for 9 months every day (I’m not pregnant yet), and it has 12mg b6, and 200mcg of b12 as well as methylfolate (I have dual hetero MTHFR). I can’t imagine i would be deficient in vitamins suddenly in the first 5 days of keto. I am drinking plenty of water, and logging my food as well as my supplements to be sure I’m reaching my electrolyte goals. I’m stumped. Part of me wonders if it’s Candida bacteria, being starved out of me (is that crazy? Probably). Im not sure why this happens to me but sometimes it lasts weeks, and is painful. Does anyone have the same experience or have any insight as to why this happens to me?"

In August of 2019 I started doing the keto WOE at 200lbs. By December 2019, I’d gotten down 180 lbs and had breast reduction surgery which was a huge success. Then around February of this year I got off track, then covid hit, and my eating just flew right out the window. 

I’ve slowly gained back the weight and my blood sugar readings aren’t so great. I’m ready to give keto another try. But this shit is hard! It’s totally a mental battle for me. I’ve had a lot of failed restarts over the last six months. My goals are not weight-related, so much as health-related. I’d like to get my diabetes into remission and be totally off Lexapro. 

Any tips, words of encouragement, or acknowledgement from anyone in a similar situation are welcome!

I started keto, and within 6 months, I had a kob for the first time, lost weight, and able to add a few more foods to my diet.

Fast forward a year, and the pandemic hit, and myself and spouse have been furloughed since March. I had so much anxiety it was awful.

My triglycerides are the big success this time, dropping from 335 in March to 115 this week.

My next goal is to get my cholesterol into normal range.  I'll work on my HDL by increasing my fatty fish and lowering my red meats and heavy cream.  I'll look into some recipes that use more polyunsaturated fats.  I'm going to add a daily walk to my routine, as well."

So the advice can be specific: I’m a 20 year old female who weighs 87kg (192lbs). My goal for the end of the year is to reach 80kg (176lbs) but would preferably like to get it done before the year ends. I’ve been on my weight loss journey since May and did keto for the whole of October but stopped. 

1. Would you recommend using protein powders? I work out six times a week and work out really hard. I really enjoy it and try and get the most out of every session. Would protein powders help with energy? Or is it more of a meal replacement to fit in protein macros? 

2. Secondly, before I was doing standard keto which I think is 70%-75% fat but I’ve read about lowering fat to around 60% and upping protein to around 30%-35%? On my fitness pal it says I would be eating 67g of Fat and 68g of protein if I went with the 60% fat approach. What do you think about that? Is it good?

keto,A Thank You Letter,"In June of this year I went in to see my doctor for blood work.  After dealing with some heavy duty depression the prior 6-9 months, I wasn't very optimistic and rightfully so, my diet was complete and utter crap.  My numbers were awful.  Damn doctor was acting like I was about to keel-over any moment and started prescribing all sorts of drugs but the one that scared the utter sh\*t out of me was insulin.  My a1c was 15!!!! (my blood must have been like syrup)

Of all the drugs he prescribed I only took the metformin er and the insulin.  I refuse to become a walking pharmacy at 50yo.  (I am not in any way encouraging any person to ignore their doctors.   YMMV)

I found r/keto within the next few days and first thing I did was bag up all the pasta, rice, ramen noodles, rice-a-roni, popcorn, and instant potatoes in my pantry and donated it all to the local food pantry.  The first couple of weeks were a challenge for sure, but lucky for me I like protein and the higher fat was a game changer like nothing before.  I was not starving to lose weight.

I went in yesterday to get my labs done again and I got the results today.  First, I've gone from 287 pounds to 223 pounds.  My a1c is now 5!  I only did the insulin for a week into keto.  I wanted off of that as soon as I possibly could.  (Yes, I told my doctor)  I am now cutting the metformin, per my doctors instructions.

My cholesterol is still high, however it's dropped significantly.  My triglycerides alone dropped by over 500!! My HDL is almost normal for the first time that I can remember.  It's at 39.  Doctor said to add some more exercise and it'll boost right up.  (Considering I have done almost none so far)

The absolute best part of it all?  My doctor said today, ""You've done an excellent job and I'm very proud of you.""  I showed her!  She didn't think I could do it.  Hell, I didn't know if I could.  But I did!

**Thank you** r/keto for providing me all the information I needed to get started and to keep going.

keto,Cheap Keto Protein powder/recipies?,"I understand there are plenty of Keto friendly Protein sources such as shakes made at home, or even brands of powder that support it, but here's the thing. It's expensive. I don't have the money to buy almond milk/butter or these 30 dollar powders inna small ass can every few weeks.

I understand eating Protein heavy foods would help, chicken, beef, turkey, eggs, so on, and I even make Protein rich meals low on fat and nearly zero carbs.

(I'm doing an all around diet, 90- fat, 100+ grams of protein, and nearly nothing in carbs, nothing being like between 40 and 60 grams).


As well as calorie counting and working out. So one giant yet pretty simple diet routine deal 

Problem is, I'm having trouble balancing my fat and carbs, keeping calories low,  AND eating Protein rich meals, and I feel a powder to drink before a workout would help significantly.

So that brings me to my question. What good cheap Keto friendly powders or recipies are there? Or, I'd gladly pay 25 bucks for a giant thing of powder.

I'm probably really over thinking this because I've never done powders, I've only ever had meals. But i did a calculator thing online, and it basically told me I need to bump my numbers up for Protein. And I'm still somewhat an amateur at all of this, so i could have things wrong, or mixed up. I mostly ask for experiences from other people because I rarely use Amazon ratings or online webfourms as research. Too bias sometimes :("
keto,What to do when i’m done with keto,If been on keto for about 6 months now. i reached my goal weight and was wondering how to maintain it without being on a strict diet. I want to know this because i started cheating on the weekends and gained about 5 pounds but eventually loose 5 maybe more during the week. Is it just my body getting used to more carbs?
keto,What is happening?,"Just started on my keto journey a week ago. I log everything I eat every day into Carb Manager and thought I was doing really well, but today I get on the scale (a week to the day of starting) and I’ve gained 1 lb???!! How is this possible?"
keto,Grandma doesn’t get Keto!,"This might sound like a trivial problem to some people, but Grandmother who visits me routinely doesn’t get my diet. I’ve never been so dedicated to making a diet work before and I’ve seen solid, honestly incredible improvements in my health. My grandmother who visits routinely laughs off my explanations of my diet every time I bring it up and surprises me with takeout every time she’s in town. (Sandwiches, burgers, FRIES!!!!) Am I supposed to eat this this stuff so I don’t hurt her feelings and scramble do to do damage control the following days after? I used to be what you’d call skinny fat.. but she’d call it healthy, if not TOO skinny... I’ve lost a lot of that lower belly/back fat now and the thought of bread, pasta, potatoes etc honestly repulses me. What to do... what to do."
keto,"Alcohol sensitivity, keto flu - What the heck happened?","Greetings.

I've been working on keto for maybe 2 weeks now. I've read about the keto flu in the FAQ, but I'm not sure if what I experienced was that, or something more.

The night before yesterday, I had a terrible toothache, so I took two shots of whiskey, and held them over my bad tooth, for about half an hour, then swallowed the whiskey. (I have an appointment at the dentist today)

Now, I'm an extremely light drinker, this same bottle of whiskey has lasted me for years.

When I woke up yesterday morning, not only did I have a decent headache (which went away with some basic pain relief), but I felt incredibly nauseous. My legs felt weaker than normal, and I also slept for an extra 6 hours. Lastly, I was pretty temperature sensitive.

I finally started to feel better much later in the day."
keto,This is depressing....,"Not so much the weight loss, which so far is almost 45 lb since September 1, although I've been at a complete standstill for almost three weeks.  What is depressing is that I spent my entire life enjoying food.   I am an accomplished cook, I started my son off on his journey to become a professional chef (and he's an excellent one), my daughter wants to study pastry and baking, and the whole family loves food.  And on this keto 'journey' I find myself for the first time in my life, hating food.  I am sick of the protein and the green nasty cabbage-y vegetables.  I don't want eggs anymore.  I am even starting to hate bacon.  Every time my wife asks me what I'd like to eat, I tell her ""a potato"".  What's worse is I won't eat something if it's even marginally unappealing.  I can't stand these artificial sweeteners, regardless if they're 'natural' or not (i.e. stevia, monkfruit) - they all taste horrible to me.  And I know that if I start eating that stuff even if I hate it, I'll want regular sugar even more.  I'm trying as hard as I can to experiment and try new things - more seafood, sous vide and BBQ meats, unsweetened sauces and no sugar in my coffee or tea, but quite frankly folks, this sucks.  I used to come home from work looking forward to dinner, since my wife does most of the weeknight cooking.  Also used to enjoy weekend meals because we tended to do the big ""Sunday Supper"" type of meals, often with a big lasagna or BBQ.  Now I sit and mope because I hate mealtime.  It's not helping my mental state or stress level.  Right now my willpower is hanging by a thread and I know with the holidays coming up, it's gonna break me.  

Anybody else dealing with this?  What do I do?"
keto,Sunflowers seeds macros,So one of my favorite snacks that I was able to keep on keto is sunflower seeds I can take down a whole bag in one sitting lol.

keto,Keto is tough during the pandemic.,"I find I'm struggling more mentally here. Not commuting and being mentally engaged at work makes me more likely to eat out of boredom.

I work from home and that in theory should make it easier. I find drinking more water is, having prepped meals is.

I'm also sad I can't support my local businesses through all these restrictions. My favorite places are struggling and I've been doing some gymnastics to see if I can ketoify their menus. I've purchased gift cards so far to support but the urge to order delivery or pickup (honestly just to give myself a reason to walk somewy that isn't 'arojnd the neighborhood') is strong.

Anyone else feeling this is a little tougher?"
keto,Pics of Face Gains after 1 Year Keto and 40 Pounds Down!,"Pictures here: [https://imgur.com/a/maExNcb](https://imgur.com/a/maExNcb) 

I'm almost halfway to my goal after losing 40 pounds over the last year-ish. I took a hiatus from calorie restriction for the first 6 months of quarantine after losing the first 30, but I kept eating keto during that time and maintained my new weight without counting macros. I was so surprised that I didn't gain weight when I weighed myself in September, that it finally kicked me back into calorie restriction and OMAD, and honestly I'm feeling pretty good about that self control. 

Before/after posts have motivated me so much over the last year, I can't even count the stories of successes and failures that I've read on here that made me bawl my eyes out because you guys were describing me and my life too. I've been here with you the whole time just working through it. I've always been self-conscious about my looks and weight, even when I was skinny (thanks for the baggage mom), but I'm posting my face gains today hoping you can also see the difference. Then maybe I will post my body gains after the next milestone."

Sometimes I have to take like 5 doses of laxatives to get things moving. It also always decides to come in the mornings on the way to work which really freaking sucks because its a 45 min drive
keto,Fatigue during physical work.,"On this current attempt of keto, I've just entered my 5th week. Sadly I still get exhausted and light headed quite quickly while working on a renovation which includes a lot of walking stairs, picking stuff up, and lifting/carrying heavy objects.

Hoped for those symptoms to be gone by now, and personally think it has to do with me not being sufficiently fat adapted. I do ingest plenty of salt which makes it tolerable for now.

Does anyone here have any thoughts or insights for me? Would be nice for me to become more productive again soon."

So I'm a little overwhelmed with the info and I can't wait to jump right in! 

I'm a tramatic/acquired brain injury survivor. I've struggled with concussions, have had a brain aneurysm and a stroke. I've been recently turned onto the keto and dairy free diet as a form of drug free therapy for my many issues.

I've already started eating a low carb diet to drop a few pounds,. I'm playing with myfitnesspal. And I'm reading as much as I can!

I'm going to drop dairy completely tomorrow once I get to the store for some lactose free milk for my coffee.

keto,Continued poor sleep,"Hello all I have been on keto for about 7-8 months but still am having poor sleep. I wake up several times through out the night and when I wake up my mind has that “won’t shut off” feeling. When I also wake up for work I feel my cortisol is always a little elevated. My electrolytes are good with 5g of Sodium, 4g of potassium and 500mg of magnesium. I drink plenty of water and exercise 4 days a week. I cut off screen an hour before bed. I figured I needed more time to adjust but being about 7-8 months I’m having concerns to what gives. I have read an article  that certain neurological systems Don’t do well on keto with a low baseline serotonin. I was also thinking about maybe it’s still insulin resistance not absorbing tryptophan. I eat one meal a day at maintenance in the evening even though nothing changed even when I was doing two meals a day. I am currently 5’10” at 170 pounds with a leaner physique. I have tried melatonin and 5htp and it doesn’t seem to help. Besides that I really don’t want have to really on taking supplement to help me sleep I would want to be able to do it naturally. I experimented and added a banana and one pack of oatmeal with my meal and it did boost my mood overall the rest of the evening. Thank you all"
keto,"I feel stupid for asking, but it's been 5 days and I have no symptoms of ketosis at all. Wtf am i doing wrong?","22 F 4'11 and 152 the last time I checked about a week or so ago

I've been eating around 10 net carbs a day and even have a pretty big calorie deficit, always under 1000. It looks and feels like I lost some water weight and that's great, I look and feel better already. But the only thing that's changed about my body is that I chug water like an elephant through it's trunk, but my job basically requires speedwalking for 8 hours so I attribute my 4 bottles of water yesterday to that. Otherwise I've had no keto flu symptoms ( been shoving some salt in my water once a day though), no nasty breath, no fatigue, nothing. The closest thing is that Im not eating as much, although I am a boredom eater and have been trying crazy hard to stop so I genuinely think that's half of it. Please help me figure out why I'm stupid, I've searched all morning and can't find anything relative and it's really disheartening."
keto,keto is expensive any tips?,"I am in the UK and unlike our American friends we seem to have far more limited access to off the shelf keto foods such as keto pizza keto icecream.

keto,Looking for Keto and Vegetarian Thanksgiving items,"Hello friends, 

We are doing Thanksgiving with 2 other family members (following COVID guidelines, and everyone is self-isolating starting today!) and they are both on Keto diets and trying to avoid “cheat” foods when possible. We are vegetarians. The main dish has been sorted, and they are bringing their own meat and we are making a tofurkey roast. 

The problem comes with sides, however! I’m assuming our usual sides like sweet potato casserole, Mac and cheese, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin pie are totally out. Does anyone have suggestions for vegetarian keto sides that we could all dig into (one at a time and then enjoying separately lol)"
keto,Guidance for The Neurodegeneratively Challenged.,"Been living with PD for the past 5 years and it is now getting worse with the tremors. Stumbled upon a movie called ""First Do No Harm"" and became interested in Therapeutic Keto. Tried to find help twice at the Charlie Foundation's website resources and never got a response back.   
I am aware there is a r/therapeutic_keto subred, but the activity in that thread is not very active.  
So my questions:

* Are there any ketoers here that are doing specifically Therapeutic Keto?
* If so, can you please tell me what that entails exactly? 
* How does it work?
* Macros at each meal?
* For those that are doing it, Have you seen any changes? Especially for PD (I know the diet is  targeted towards Epilepsy.) What ratio do you do 3:1, 4:1?
* How do you get to nutritional or therapeutic ketosis? Is it necessary to be in therapeutic ketosis   
(3-5 mol) for you to see changes?

I know it is alot of questions, but I would really appreciate the helpful feedback.

Thanks."
keto,I am finally under 300 pounds since graduating from college,"Hello, I just wanted to share this with this wonderful community. I have been doing keto for roughly 5 months, and I have lost 50 pounds so far, but to me, the biggest win has been to finally be under 300 pounds for the first time in a very long time. The last time I weighed under 300 was my senior year of college. I am so glad I decided to give this thing a try because for the first time, I can actually see myself reaching my weight goals and I can actually see being healthy as a real thing.

And while I celebrate this, this is no time to stop. Gotta keep riding this momentum. The next big milestone will be when I get to 250. Hopefully, you will see that post soon!! 🙂"

keto,Had an Epiphany last night - hope this helps someone,"You are not your body and you are not your mind!

Forewarning: you have to think a little deeper here

I did keto a few years back for a good two years and then been on and off for the last year of so. Went from 295 to 218. Now 240, male,  30 years old and could not figure out why I couldn't lose weight anymore. I know it has to do with the fact I couldn't control certain aspects of my eating,  like too many berries, cream,  and fake sugar. And the whole halfassing it. 

I've always had a difficult time with feeling satiated in the P.M. and last night, something was different. I simply asked myself, ""what are you trying to accomplish by eating this way? Isn't food meant for survival more then it is pleasure? Aren't there millions of people, including children, that are currently starving in the world? Aren't you bigger than your own mind?"" 

Wait a second.. bigger than my mind?  Then it hit me, yes I am bigger than my mind. In fact, we are not are minds. We are much bigger than that. Our higher selves have control over what we put into our bodies. We don't need to listen to our brains that think we want a certain food, whether that is for pleasure or survival. We can say no to our minds! Let me say that again! 

YOU CAN SAY NO TO YOUR OWN MIND!

Believe that you are not your mind but a soul energy spirit in essence form living in the human body, a vessel. 

You decide, over your own mind, what to put into your body.

If your automobile only took premium gasoline, would you put in unleaded? Your body is an automobile for your soul. Take care of it and do not let your thoughts control its every outcome."

After - I now weigh 258.

I’ve lost the weight thru keto diet,  eating mainly once a day and changing my thoughts and beliefs that led to the weight gain. I’ve also stopped drinking alcohol, which now in hindsight, realize I was dependent, drinking several times a week. My resting heartrate has gone down almost 30
points (its 50’s to low 60’s now), BP is back to normal, edema is gone. The edema was so bad, I could press down on my ankle and shin and it would stay indented. This has all resolved. I also do self hypnosis and meditation.  Depression is lifting.


Along with the Keto diet; I only drink coffee (with cream), tea and water. Alcohol and diet soda cravings are gone, sugar cravings are gone. I’m
not hungry, I no longer over eat. I don’t eat keto desserts or processed keto type foods (such as protein bars etc) I stick to mostly whole foods. I still have more weight to lose to get back to my “normal” weight, but am feeling much better. Don’t give up,

keto,How does black unsweetened cold brew have 3 carbs and 15 cals!?,"I bought SToK cold brew, unsweetened, nothing in it except coffee and “natural flavor” - and it has 3 carbs. I’ve been unwittingly guzzling it. Does anyone know how/why there are carbs? In a 12oz serving of regular coffee there’s like &lt;1 carb so how is this possible?"
keto,Arby’s Roast Beef - why so bad?,"I eat roast beef about Once per month. Store bought sliced roast beef is Keto friendly. 

My wife was going to Arby’s and asked if there was anything Keto I could eat from there. I said yes sure roast beef.

Turns out I was WRONG, after tossing the bun, I ate the roast beef. Then I researched the nutritional values and I was surprised to find really bad numbers.
The bun is either packed with carbs as I was hoping or the roast beef is full of carbs.

Please someone prove me wrong!!"
keto,Keto and Celiac?,"I know that at a high level keto and celiac (gluten allergy) are a match made in heaven, but can anyone with celiac provide some feedback please? 

For those that don't know, part of having celiac disease, instead of just an allergy to gluten, is that your body does not absorb vitamins and minerals like it is supposed to which means it is helpful to take in extra.

I tried keto earlier this year for only about 2 months and had success in losing weight in the 3 weeks and then not another pound for the next 5 (and I have a lot to lose so this was unexpected). However, my biggest concern and what brings me to this is that I started to feel awful at the same time I stopped losing weight (around week 4). I'm talking extremely tired, achy, etc. Any thoughts? I take several vitamins a day and that didn't change. I basically need them to function. I kept up with the other minerals so that I didn't have keto flu. The only thing I could think of is maybe I was missing the extra that I get from fruits and high carb veggies that I had cut out. Is this possible?

Real question: could my body be relying on the vitamins from fruits and  vegetables too much for this to be successful?"
keto,My Keto Journey So Far,"I used to weigh 491.8 pounds 32 weeks or 7 months ago and as of today I weigh 426.8 pounds. That means I have lost a total of 65 fucking pounds so far. I have been eating at or below 30g of net carbs, at or below 2000 calories everyday. I have cheated some days binging on keto sweet snacks but overall I have done good so far. I'm proud of myself. Also starting today I'm going to restart the keto diet eating at or below 30g of net carbs, at or below 50g of total carbs and at or below 2000 calories everyday. I will also do IF everyday and try to commit to not cheating at all each week. Wish Me Luck On Losing More Fat!!!"
keto,Checking in and thank you and hormones,"Thank you so much to this community and everyone in it. I started keto almost on a whim in early September, feeling out of control about my food choices, weighing in heavier than I ever had before, and facing down a very stressful year in both directions.

I've struggled with disordered eating in the past and had been wary of calorie counting/weighing as a trigger, but keto seemed different enough and I decided to try it. I read the FAQ and read this community almost religiously.

It's been going well! my loss was fast at first then a bit slower but steady, and then noticed that I would go through weights twice on my way down (i.e., I would get under 190, then go back up, and take a couple of days to pass through it again, the second time for good). Seeing that pattern helped me feel better. Then I stayed within the same 3 pounds for about 10 days, not making it back down.

I had read so many posts from panicked people being reassured about weight loss being nonlinear and a week not being a stall and kcko, etc etc, and despite that, I still got spooked! It gave me so much more empathy for folks! Even when I intellectually understood that everything was fine, there was still a part of me panicking! So I soothingly repeated back to myself all the things I have seen veterans here write to newbies, and I did in fact keep (mostly) calm and keto on, and eventually hit another swoosh. So thank you! As exasperating as I'm sure it is to keep repeating to all the same posts over and over again, it does sometimes get through to a wider audience :)

Mostly I am feeling the same (which is ok, I didn't feel bad before) but one strange thing that happened that I'm wondering whether it's connected is that my biological clock came roaring back after a few weeks of keto. I had pretty much put that whole idea of babies to bed. Now pondering what to do about it, if anything, considering I am a single lady with a pretty good life and finally getting my figure back to where I want it.

Anyway, thanks all!"
keto,Vanishing cold sores.,"Been on keto for 6 months now.   I've noticed that I haven't had a cold sore since. Usually get one every 2-3 months.  Could be a coincidence.

I understand the arginine-lysine ratio and staying away from heavy arginine foods like almond and coconut flour. 

But they're might be more to it. Could the reduced inflammation and decrease in anxiety and increase in mental clarity from keto have something to do with it also?

Has anybody experienced the same thing or the opposite and had more breakouts?"

keto,What do your meals look like? I can’t get my ratios right,"Hello everyone! 

I am in my early twenties and I’ve been doing keto for a couple of days now is my 4th or 5th day. I’m doing this diet just for all the overall health benefits that I can get from it and I’ve heard it can be good for ibs and migraines of which I have both. 

My only issue is that I just can’t get my ratios right. Everything I’ve googled and watched on YouTube most people eat like 2 eggs and butter for breakfast or eggs and avocado. So today I ate 
2 eggs fried in butter with some cheese + half an avocado 
I was planning on eating chicken wings for lunch but I put that into the keto app and it says I’ve gone over my protein intake (and I only put in 8 chicken wings which doesn’t rlly seem like a lot). 
I still have calories and fat left to eat tho on the app but my protein is over and I don’t really understand how I’m meant to balance it out For me to actually be able to eat dinner as well. 
Should I eat only 1 egg in the morning? How is everyone doing it??

Also I am ALWAYS HUNGRY I’m never satisfied which is very very unusual to me before I started on this diet I’d have to hype myself up to eat or to finish my food or be interested in it 

Sorry for the ignorance the way I used to eat before going keto had 0 thought into it"
keto,Increase in LDL,"I’m 54, female. I’ve lost almost 60 lbs, with close to 40 left to lose. I’ve been low carb/keto for about 5.5 months and my cholesterol levels have jumped significantly. My LDL is 129, total cholesterol is 202, non HDL is 148, triglycerides 93, HDL is 54. I don’t want to add back some carbs to decrease my cholesterol because my A1c is finally back in normal range (5.2). I mostly eat chicken and lean ground beef, cheese, nuts (usually pecans) and eggs. Should I decrease the eggs (normally I eat 1-2 a day) and cheese? Just added niacin to my supplements."

I remember when I used to weigh 75 back a few years ago, take a lot of pictures on holidays, with friends, out at night &amp; etc.. but now I have noticed since becoming overweight , that I don’t have any pictures of me in my camera roll for a long time, and I really don’t like that. Angles can’t save me 😄

Funny thing is, I’d feel like a catfish if I posted those old pictures of myself.

Planning to eat combinations of egg dishes for breakfasts, snacking cheese and avocados &amp; nuts for lunch, and nice fulfilling steaks &amp; any other type of meats for dinner.

Looking forward to your suggestions. I am coming from an emotional eating &amp; binge eating addiction, craving a lot of sugary and unhealthy products.

keto,Eureka moment,"So I went to a kids birthday today fully in ketosis. I fell victim to the party pies and cake. No more than 30 minutes after leaving I have a raging headache and crazy sinus pressure. First time I’ve realised the negative effects of carbs on my body. 
Blessing in disguise I think. Never felt it before so never fully appreciated the positive physiological effects of being on a low carb diet."
keto,Going back to school,"So I am currently in law school, getting ready to take the bar. We should've done it this month but due to the pandemic, that obviously isn't going to happen. Instead, we're going to resume in January. Basically, I'd have to move into the dorms (which are awful, but w/e),  and there are no allowances for food or anything, so I may have to revert to eating whatever I can find. I know ill probably gain all the weight back which ugh. I've been trying to concoct a decent plan for food. I do a clean keto (lots of nuts, some cruciferous veg, flaxseed, and fish + chicken, absolutely no dairy except butter sometimes, and 1 cup of black coffee in the morning) I've also been doing alternate day fasting for about 3 weeks, and I can see myself continuing with this for the rest of my life (that's how much I enjoy it). My current plan, I think is to make 2 large keto meals when I come home on the weekends, that meets my 1700 feeding day calories. So I'll only have to worry about food on Monday and Wednesday (since I'd be home Friday nights, to Sunday afternoons), 

So for my plan, I have a great recipe for pork steaks (500g raw), I'm not sure what that amounts to cooked, because there are so many differing answers online)
But that and something like a while avocado. 2 protein shakes with coconut oil and macadamia or almond milk. 4 slices of almond/psyllium bread(which I would bake at home on Sundays)
All in all, this would make about 1800 calories, 110g protein, 141g fat, 16g Net carbs.  

Before you come for me re protein, I'm 26F, 198lbs, and I don't lift weights (hypermobile joints), I do have a significant amount of muscle mass naturally, and from lifting before I got injured. Also, it's law school, so I'll mostly be sedentary anyway. 
So please, advice? Bitchy comments? Anything that could be helpful in helping me maintain a steady weight loss for the few months I'll be stuck in the dorms? 

I could also go on  30 day water fast, but I worry about falling ill at the exact time I need my brain to be high functioning. She's a mess."

2 month update: Sept 13th-Nov 13th
I have had the biggest rollercoaster this year with family issues, pandemic, mental health etc. I knew I needed to take care of myself mentally and physically, but most days I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. And Covid was going to hurt me mentally because I love the outdoors and just getting out of the house. Ever since it happened the best pest part of my week has been going to the grocery store and walking around. I started noticing though how my cart could look so much healthier and I was so ashamed that It was full of junk and frozen meals. When honestly I love fruits, veggies and cooking, I just didn’t have enough energy to make anything. After talking to my mother who was on keto for a few months, I thought the diet was too good to be true. But what was the harm if it gave me an extra reason to motivate and push myself to take care of my body? 
And here we are, almost two months later and I’ve lost 24 pounds. 2-4! That’s crazy. And even crazier, I’ve loved every moment of being on Keto. I feel happier, I clean more, and I’M EXCITED TO COOK EVERYDAY! I feel like I could knock down mountains with the confidence I’ve regained from this lifestyle. I still have 33 pounds to go, but I’m in no rush. My pants fit like a dream and I can wear some of my old clothes. I’ve even done my makeup/hair everyday I’m off work. This has been such an eye opener for me and I hope anyone who reads this will find comfort in knowing you can achieve anything you want if you just put forth the effort!  I know I’m gonna see this through and I’m so excited to get there! Cheers friends!"

keto,"Plateau during IF 16:8 (Modified ""Keto"")","32M, 5'5""

I've been doing higher-protein keto during the week and then taking it easy on the weekends. It's been 10 weeks and I've almost averaged -2 lbs. but have plateaued these last 2 weeks. I've even stayed 2 lbs. above my low of 159.8 (down from 178.8).

I fully expect to regain a few lbs. over the weekend due to more carbs/drinking and retaining water but I usually lose the weight over the week and then some. This last time, not so much.

Calories in: started at 1600 and as I've sheded the lbs. I dropped it by the 50-100s. After almost 2 weeks of plateauing I cut it down to 1200.

BMR: Allegedly I burn ~1695 just existing.

After a year of some very scary health issues (hospitalized with double pneumonia and flu in March, asthma since childhood, &amp; autoinflammatory arthritis since teens), I decided two months ago to start Keto &amp; exercising daily (walking, stationary bike, &amp; strength exercises). I lost \~20 lbs in the first month, most of which I guessed was water weight. I was so excited to see my doctor again and figured she'd be thrilled, but she was not happy that I dropped the weight so fast! She said losing or gaining too fast in a short period can hurt your gallbladder. It's not that I don't believe her, but ...   


I'm feeling so much better &amp; stronger. I'm breathing better. I haven't even used my rescue inhaler since this summer. My arthritis inflammation is way down and I don't wake up in pain anymore. I've ditched my pain meds &amp; arthritis infusions. I'm eating only when I'm hungry, always around 1300/cals per day. I'm choosing healthy foods and not just meats &amp; cheeses. I eat a lot of vegetables and my protein is great. She was happy with my food tracking on MyFitnessPal, but she said not to come back having lost another 20 lbs in a month again. (I don't think I would? I honestly think it was one big whoosh at the beginning &amp; now it's more slow &amp; steady)  


Any thoughts? She put a fear in me and I don't want to be afraid to keep going!

keto,"NSV--A month in, Keto has given me back my life (from Chronic Pain)!","I am a 32 year old woman. I have had PCOS my whole life and have been insulin resistant/pre-diabetic since I was 18. I have also always struggled with migraines, about 1-2 a month on the low end. I have successfully lost significant amounts of weight with CICO previously, but have never been able to keep it off with having babies and breastfeeding because of my hormonal issues. I felt helpless to change anything. My hormones went really crazy starting about a year ago and I started having 1-2 migraines every single week and was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. I had severe pain in my neck, shoulders, and joints. I got COVID-19 in September and the inflammation was so widespread and painful for weeks afterward I felt like I could barely get out of bed. It made me feel like a really crappy mom and wife because all I wanted to do was go to bed. 

We moved into a new house at the beginning of October and I started Keto shortly thereafter. Guys. It has changed my life. I don't care if I don't lose any weight (but I have!). I have a Theracane I used to use EVERY NIGHT to try to relax my muscles enough just to sleep. I haven't touched it since I started Keto. I used over-the-counter pain meds several times a week just to get through the day. I have only taken Ibuprofen maybe twice in the last month. I have had ONE mild migraine. 

I honestly could cry from relief. I feel like I'm a much better mom, wife, employee, PERSON because of Keto. I have been losing weight, and losing it much more quickly than when I did straight up CICO. I haven't been weighing (haven't found my scale in the unpacking yet!) but based on how my clothes fit I'd say 2 dress sizes on top, maybe 1 on bottom (my butt and hips like to hold on to that sweet, sweet fat). 

And the biggest win? I am not even TEMPTED to cheat. Seriously. I can tell when I eat something with hidden added sugar or I get close to my carb limit because my pain comes back. So no thanks. Chronic pain is not worth it!! 

Anyway, sorry that was so long, but I just can't even begin to express how life changing this has been! I wish I knew about Keto 10 years ago when I was struggling desperately to try to lose weight on low-fat, high-carb diets that made me feel like absolute shit!"
keto,Post partum... looking for motivation,"I’m looking for some motivation. I was keto about a year before getting pregnant, strict at first then started cheating a lot, but my results stuck. I was 105 lbs at 5’4” and when I got pregnant my doctor told me to aim for 30-40 lbs to have a healthy baby. By the 40th week I hit exactly 40 lbs which my doctor was pleased with. It looked really cute when 9 mo pregnant! 

But after parting with baby and the puffiness faded, I am left with about 15 lbs of awkward weight. Looks like 30lbs on someone with my frame. And it went straight to my chin! And my thighs. My tummy surprisingly bounced back. I look and feel old. I have a lot of stress and my self esteem is at an all time low. 

My husband has so many beautiful pictures with our baby...my heart aches a bit when I see myself in photos with baby. Sometimes I feel people are cruel for taking pictures of me from certain angles. Maybe it is intentional? I was always slim and my mom was overweight, but when I put on this weight she decided to go keto herself and lost a ton of weight. She looks wonderful and I’m so proud of her but yesterday I went through her phone and found she takes unflattering pictures of me when I’m not looking. Photos of me eating or slumped on the couch. She never did this when I was slim so I wonder if it is some form of motivation for her. She also often jumps to compare herself to me when I mention my bodily changes. It’s as if she’s taking advantage of my vulnerable state. I really want her to feel good about herself and I don’t want to hurt her motivation... she is 60, after all. I think I just need to lose the weight so I don’t have to analyze this so much and make sure these pictures don’t continue. I want my baby to grow up and look at pictures of us without feeling sorry for me. 

Some barriers are that Im breastfeeding and would worry about the quality and quantity of my milk. I don’t have much time to cook low/no carb meals on a daily basis. Also, my husband has a very strong sweet tooth and tends to believe it’s what I need if I’m feeling down. He comes home with all kinds of packaged sweets when I’m having a rough time. I tell him please support my diet but he keeps doing it. I know he means the best. I also imagined when I have a family I will cook a lot of ethnic foods that are sentimental to me. I have been practicing making them and obviously, I’m eating them too. I just can’t seem to go all in keto like I did before I got pregnant. The will power is not there, especially when my self esteem is low."
keto,"I got my type 2 prediabetic dad to do keto, and after 2 months his blood sugar is now at a normal level!","As the title says. 

My dad has been struggling with his blood sugar for several years now. I started keto the end of august and after he saw my progress, he wanted to try it too. His blood sugar level at his last doctors appointment (end of May) was at 7.6, which is very high. The doctor told him to try and get it under 7.0, as that would be a normal level. Well, he had another doctors appointment last week, and his blood sugar is now at 6.3!! A HUGE victory for him, and his doctor is THRILLED. He’s been strictly keto for 8 weeks now, and he’s amazed with the results so far! He’s lost 25 lbs during this time too and said he thinks he’ll try dating again when he loses another 10 lbs 😉"
keto,Hellbent on getting it right this time,"I’m starting keto again after many failed attempts this coming Monday.

I try make the effort to go walks during lunch or after work (weather permitting). I’m really only doing about 3k steps a day. Weekends are much better, I go hikes and swim. Im eating about 1200-1300 cals a day I’m 5’3 female 165lbs.... will being on keto still help me lose weight or do I need to introduce more exercise? 

Thanks"
keto,"I don't get enough protein from food and at Costco Canada, there are these inexpensive protein powder. Would you recommend them?","[These ones for example](https://imgur.com/a/iaNFqKo). I need to get around 100-150g of protein each day and it's too difficult to get it from food, I'm still hungry at times and I'm experience slight hair loss, this usually happens when I don't get enough protein.  
 
I linked to two versions, one is Iso whey and the other is a blend. Would these be okay? I would be having 2-3 scoops each day."

keto,What helped me lose weight with keto,"How's it going,

My name is Thomas and I am new to the reddit community. I just wanted to reach out and let everyone know what helped me.

So 2 months ago I had a custom keto diet made for me and I am not kidding when I say it changed my life. I have lost 43LBS in 2 months.

Basically you give them some info about yourself and they create a custom keto diet plan based on your food preference, activity level, height, weight, gender, and weight loss goals.

[Here is a link to it](http://jacksoncashwellness.org/CustomKetoDiet)

It has helped me tremendously so I thought I would share it with you!

(also I would recommend you watch the video because it has some great info in it)

Good luck, I hope this helps you out. Keep me updated!"
keto,Has anyone here tried Raspberry Ketones and alongside keto diet?,"Hey guys, I've recently just finished reviewing a raspberry ketone supplement on my blog.  I wont share as not sure about the rules for this room but just out of curiosity I wondered if anybody here has tried raspberry ketones or a product called Raspberry ketone plus.  Also another thing I am curious about is if anyone has taken RK alongside the keto diet and if this has made any improvements by doing so."
keto,Why this diet really works for me,"So I’m nearly 2 weeks in. Apart from the real benefits of keto, I’ve noticed something else. If I was doing your run of the mill CICO with no particular focus on macros, technically nothing would be off limits, if I wanted to sacrifice a ‘healthy’ snack for some chocolate, I wouldn’t think much of it. So at my work there’s usually a bunch of muffins, cookies and tubes of Pringles in the break room and on night shift they’ll lay it out on the front desk. Now that any of that food is unacceptable I absolutely can’t break my diet and to be perfectly honest my meal before work keeps me full and I am just about feeling that lack of hunger. If I was eating carbs, they’d always be room for something sweet."
keto,Sodium deficiency?,"Hey all! Ive been on keto for about a month and a half now, and I’m stoked about my 20lb weight loss (!!!). But recently, I’m starting to feel dizzy, really bad brain fog, faint sometimes, and really lethargic. Do you guys think I’m sodium deficient? Ive tried to drink a bunch of water recently to stay hydrated. Maybe that has something to do with it? Thank you!"
keto,"What is your go to ""sick food""?","My mom always gave us bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast when we had upset stomachs, but the BRAT rule is all carbs.

Thanks!"
keto,Electrolyte Powder recommendations,"Been doing keto for a few years now and I am loving it, down about 70lbs, was down more but...COVID.

keto,How to gain fats on keto?,"I started low-carb in June and slowly transitioned into keto, and I enjoy the reduced anxiety as well as improved brain function. 

One problem is that I am currently underweight. Haven’t been on a scale in the last year and to my surprise, my BMI is below 18. Body fats is estimated to be below 6.5% from my neck and waist circumference.

I don’t think I am in caloric deficit, my average meal has 5-6 oz of meat, two table spoons of cooking oil (lard, coconut or olive) and plenty of vegetables. I also snack on homemade yogurt and homemade peanut butter in moderation. 

I am NOT looking to gain lean weight, I just don’t feel comfortable knowing my body fat is approaching bare minimum. How should I gain fats? Simply increasing the portions is not effective for me since I would be too satiated and skip the next meal."

keto,Hangovers?,"Hey guys,
Never posted here before, but here we go.
Last week I had a swish fundraiser event I somehow got a free ticket to. I was worried because I just got onto stict keto, and didnt want to mess up my progress. So the first thing I did when I woke up was calculate how much I could drink that night. I decided to stick to champagne and I figured out if I didnt eat any carbs I could have max 12 glasses of champagne (dont worry I didnt drink that much haha).

So I went to the event, did drink quite a bit (maybe 7-8 glasses haha), had the meat/fish options at the buffet and just had fun.
Wake up next morning and I have almost no hangover!!?! and ended up loosing 0.5 kilo the next day too! Im know Im young, but I usually feel like I've been hit by a bus and gain 2-3 kilos of water weight!

I thought about it and usually if Im at a party or event there is always snacks and I usually drink sweet alcohol. But even at fancy dinners when I drink red wine, I will also eat non-keto sides.

Now its obvious in my mind that its the sugar spike that is giving me the BAD part of the hangover. Ever since I started drinking correctly for keto, my life has changed (epsecially as a HSP) haha, never looking back!"
keto,Alcohol and protein powder,"Trying to get back in to shape.  Started lifting again recently and wondering if there are any good keto or low card protein powders

Or no alcohol at all?"

keto,Tips for getting back on track?,"Since I started, I've had one or two small slips, but they were easily recoverable. Over the last few days though, I ended up going off for one meal, and... it became more than one meal. I flipped some sort of switch. The carb cravings are maddening, keto foods sound gross, and things are definitely not the easy autopilot they were. 

I'm determined to get back on track, through sheer willpower if I have to. But it'd be great if anyone has tips (besides don't go off- figuring that one out :), that might make it easier. Ease in? More radical with carnivore/IF? Things to eat/occupy yourself? Just like doing Day 1 again? 

This might be one of those things that's too hard to generalize. But I figured it couldn't hurt to ask!"
keto,The Best Cold Weather Diet,"     Now that the weather is getting colder I've really come to realize how great of a winter diet keto is. The days are getting dark early and the weather is cold. It's nice knowing that I'm going to go home after work and have a nice big fatty meal that will satiate me and make me happy.

     I've done low fat diets in the past and this weather just reminds me of some of the times that I would be driving home from work on a cold dark day, knowing I had a three day old chicken breast and broccoli meal prep in the fridge, then just grabbing something super unhealthy on the way home because I just really wanted something that would hit the spot.

       With keto I've reached my goal weight this year eating foods that hit the spot every day. That's definitely not gonna change with the weather."
keto,ISO a nice 'crisp' swap for crackers.,"What I'm missing most is crackers.  I'm sub 15 carbs right now and doing well after 3 weeks (This is my second trip down keto lane) and I'm really missing something cracker like.  I really don't need any flavor, cheese and salami will do that, but the crunch isn't there.  


baked cheese crisps aren't cutting it.    


I haven't tried any of the 'keto' crackers because quite frankly, they are terribly expensive.  


I have tried celery but it's too 'wet', ruins it."
keto,Sugar/Carb rash,"Keto for 4 months. SW: 163 CW: 153 GW: 145.  I struggle with being hungry all the time and the mood swings during shark week.  I'm learning that most of this is due to electrolyte balance and not cutting my calories too much (I'm a trail runner, cyclist, and mountain biker).

I keep taking two steps forward and one backward.  I'm ultimately fine with that because I'm learning each time I regress.  This diet has a steep learning curve.  Yet being off the blood sugar crash rollercoaster ride is amazing!

So, on occasion I have been known to regress completely and eat a slice of pizza.  This has happened maybe five or six times.  I'm fine with it.  The consequences don't seem to be too bad.  I mention the cheats because recently I've been getting bouts of a hot, red, slightly swollen face.  I can't seem to link it specifically to ""Cheat days"".  Sometimes it lasts a couple of days and sometimes up to a week. So, my question is, why is this happening?  What have I become sensitive to?  Has anyone else had this issue? Is it more electrolyte imbalance but manifesting differently?

I googled ""Sugar rash"" and that looks like my face.  But it's been days since I've had sugar.  Am I becoming sensitive to alcohol?  Something else?"
keto,"Why do some quest bars not have palm kernel oil, but others do?","Like, I know I should TRY to avoid palm oil, both for health and environmental issues involving them. But I love quest bars.

keto,November Journey,"My keto journey began just 10 days ago on Nov 2, 2020. I was at the heaviest I've ever been in my life 6'3, 269lbs. I've done keto in the past and was very successful w/o exercise and just months of maintaining the diet. This time around I noticed that after my first week I dropped off a cool 7 lbs (what i'm thinking is just water weight), but now nothing. 

I goto the gym 5 days a week. 1hr of cardio (total) each day and also weight training mixed in.  This current week I've noticed that since the initial weight drop the scale doesn't seem to be moving. I'm trying not to let that discourage me and I'm wondering if it's because a) the muscle I'm building weights more than fat and therefore it's maybe keeping the scale around the same while I may in fact be having some Non scale victories that I don't immediately notice? I have noticed that my watch fits just a bit looser on my wrists, but obviously everyone likes to the see those scale numbers drop. I know it's still VERY early and hopefully by like the end of the month I've be seeing much better progress?

Anyone have any encouraging input? Currently I'm now 262.8lbs (fluxates a bit higher sometimes) As for eating, I do take supplements to assist with my workouts and recovery and my appetite has somewhat gone down a LOT. Daily I eat approx 

breakfast - 2eggs/3slices bacon

lunch - salad w/ chicken &amp; vinegarette dressing or a homemade keto pizza on some days

dinner - some variation of either chicken, pork chop, beef with steamed or fresh veggies as my side

water - minimum 8 glasses/day

snacks - varies between 1 or 2 of the following:  pepperjack cheese sticks, pepperoni (or keto pizza with 4g carb flat bread) beef jerky, Keto ice cream bars from Costco (4g carbs/per bar)"
keto,Experience with keto and MS?,"I just started keto (I’m talking today, just started).

keto,Is there an active sub for doing keto as a type 2 diabetic?,"Newbie here, just looking for a community I suppose? I'm mostly wondering what one does on keto if one's blood sugar dips too low? Is eating sugar acceptable in that case or is there another method that wouldn't break ketosis?  I know I'll have to decrease insulin and that's fine, but right now for example I keep sugar tablets on me just in case.  Low blood sugar for a diabetic can be life threatening. Anyway with 2.2 million here someone must be type 2, any advice is very appreciated. Thanks!"

keto,Mistakes with soda were made.,"So mid-week after trying yet again to get on track with keto I went ended messing up by getting regular ginger ale that instead of a diet one, so instead of 14 carbs net carbs for the day I now have 35. Will this derail me badly?"
keto,What can I drink on keto?,"I'm 16F and I'm new to keto. I'm really bored of plain water and I want something fizzy with very little flavor to itch my cravings. I have a bottle of Schweppes tonic water in the fridge (regular) and I wanted to know if I am allowed to drink any in small amounts. I don't really drink milk or coffee to begin with, so that was easy to omit. The tonic water does have a little sugar in it and I'm afraid that would hinder me from reaching ketosis."
keto,This is the hardest thing I've had to do.,"My SO was too tired to cook for himself, he usually just puts on and oven pizza, and the freezer was broken so his food had defrosted. He also can't cook (he claims he can but I'm yet to see it and we've been together for three years).

The only things in out cupboard and fridge that aren't for my keto diet are pasta. Now I love pasta. I made him pasta to my standards and I uses to be a chef and the smell was amazing. The sauce looked amazing. I honestly didn't think it would effect me as much as it did. I hurriedly put it together thrust the bowl in his arms and went upstairs to write this post. I asked him for the sake of my sanity to eat it downstairs.

I'm also for hours into my fasting period. I'm proud, I didn't lick my fingers that entire time or even take a tiny bite. The temptation was there. I can't even have a drink to take the pain away as I'm giving up drinking.

keto,Have I lost fat or water weight?,"I have I lost 10 lbs in the past 9 days. I have been keeping very well hydrated, and I have been weighing myself in the morning and evening with only a 1lb difference between the two times. 
My body measurements have also changed. My waist was 26.5 inches and is now 25 inches, and my thighs were 24 and are now 23. I have been eating 1000 calories a day on Keto, for 9 days, (which is actually more than I was eating before, but I was eating a lot more carbs, I have PCOS which is why I’m doing Keto to begin with). 
I have been keeping my carbs at 6-19g per day. I have also been walking for an hour and a half everyday (was otherwise finding it difficult during lockdown) and I have also been working out for an hour, 6 days a week. 

Overall, my body looks better, but I’m already fairly lean, so 10 lbs would be A LOT and surely more noticeable?"

keto,From clear skin to acne breakouts,"Heller Keto people, new member here.
8 days into Keto now, feels great aside from one thing bothering me and just makes me want to quit.
That is Acne breakouts. See before I started keto I had very clear skin, I always have I would rarely get breakouts but occasionally it happens maybe 1 or 2 pimples.
Last 2 days I’ve got like 6+ on my forehead and 2 on my neck.
Is this just a temporary thing or is it something that comes with keto and I have to accept it and sacrifice clear skin?

What are your experiences guys? Is this normal? Will it go away or will it continue? I’m honestly considering quitting..

Thanks in advance."

keto,Doing Keto while on Lexapro,Hi everyone! I’ve been doing keto for 3 months now and I’m down about 15 pounds. I’ve been on lexapro for my anxiety for about 6 years. I saw my doctor a few weeks ago and she was happy to hear I’m having some success with a keto lifestyle. She did say that the lexapro could possibly make my weight loss slower because it makes my body not want to give up the stored weight (or something along those lines). I’m just wondering what other ketoers on lexapro or a similar medication have experienced? I’m so happy to have lost 15 pounds but I’m not sure if I’m doing keto right or if maybe my weight loss is slower due to lexapro. Just wanting to check in to see what others have experienced. Thank you for any advice.

keto,A big thank you for the succes,"1 oktober i started with the keto diet. I lurked here and found a lot of advice. 1 oktober I was 1.89m and 115 kilo's. I gained a lot after stopping smoking and no diet wasn't my thing exactly.

Now today 11 november I stepped on the scale and I'm now 103 kilos. It works and I feel a lot better. Nightshifts aren't a problem anymore, I have the entire day energy and no dips, not hungry anymore, I feel mentally better.

But the 3 first week where hell. Aggressive behavior, couldn't sleep, a lot of cravings and keto-flu but I knew this would happen so I sat out the storm and in week 4 I felt great. Now I'm eating a nice ketobun with a self made big beef burger with self made sauce and bacon, no diet wouldt allow this hahaha."
keto,Christmas Keto Concerns,"Hey Guys

First time posting here, thought I'd start by saying this subreddit has guided me and been a source of inspiration since I started Keto 12 weeks ago, so thanks a bunch you wonderful shredders!

I'm happy to say at 12 weeks in I am 45 pounds down and fully on board the Keto express, with it consuming so much of my life I'm inducing eye rolls from friends every time I mention it now! 

The reason for my post here was to ask the group how you all have dealt with Christmas in the past or how you are planning to deal with it in the coming weeks. I am planning to have a week off the diet in order to eat some of the normal Christmas goodies and maybe have a beer or 8. The hankering for roast pototoes is strong and I could easily eat London's supply of King Edwards if you guys don't talk me down. 

Since I'm relatively new to this I just wanted to hear some thoughts from the group regarding how bad an idea this is and how easy or difficult it will be to get back on the Keto express come January. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks again for all the support and success stories!"

keto,Down 11.2 lbs in a little over a month!,"I started Keto again on September 28th. Today is weigh in for me and the hubs (he’s not doing keto), and I was expecting to hopefully be back in my 170s for sure as my starting weight was 188.4. I am today 177.2 lbs.  I am so happy especially after getting bronchitis, having very little time for exercise, and cheat meals on the weekends only(not cheat days). I could sit here and say it’s easy. Any kind of “dieting” will be hard especially at first. But seeing that scale go down makes it even more motivating.  Trust me I don’t always eat the healthiest on Keto but I keep it Keto.  Even better now that I found the zero carb bread at Aldi.  Lol.  I probably could’ve been down more by now if I was strictly doing keto but cheat meals on the weekends works for me and so I’ll keep doing just that.  Might not be keto 100% but Monday through Friday are my keto days and weekends are calorie counting days.  Everything in moderation.  Remember to go easy on yourself.  Not everyday do I stay under 24g of carbs. But I don’t allow it to bring me down.  Hopefully this motivates someone to start, keep going or change the way they think/do their keto.  ☺️💕"
keto,Keto too much protein = sugar? didn't see this adressed in the faq specifically,"Hey guys, I was reading the faq, but I didn't see where it adressed this other than it said eating lots of protein is ok, i just want to confirm

Reason being is I want to cut fat as its lots of calories for cheese, and I can just put more meat in dinners n stuff, or for a snack  


so it isn't going to hurt anything if i go over my protein limit as long as i eat at my calorie deficit for weight loss?   


I know fat is supposed to make you feel more full, but what works for me better i think is just  more bites lol  


also I'm not losing weight nearly as fast as I did the first time ( 315 to 280 ) a year later now ( had some important stuff come up is to why i stopped) i can focus on me now.   - 272-267  to fluctuate 262.5 to 267.  


i figure less fat  = more weight loss as long as im at my calorie deficit, but to do this i was going to eat more protein without sweating about it  (1200 to 1700)   


Thank you all!"

I've been struggling with loosing weight all my life and now I got it in the bag. I was 250 my first day as a high school student and I gained 50 pounds of fat over 9 weeks of summer. I'm in the marching band and as of June 6th I've been working out and drinking and eating paleo/keto.

keto,Lose too much too fast?,"Hey Keyo folks. Thanks for all the information and inspiration.
Question. I'm roughly 2 months into getting back on the Keyo train.
Starting weight was 315lbs, male 6'0"", sedentary office job. Started out losing quite fast doing keto, keeping carbs under 25-30/day. Got to 287lbs and hit plateau for about 2 weeks. Still was eating a fair amount and calorie count was higher since I was just restricting carbs nothing else.
My appetite was under control now so I decided to add IF 9pm-noon and calorie restriction to 1800 per day. Since making those changes I've dropped 6 pounds in 5 days. So is there a point where I should dial it back and increase my calorie intake to slow the weight loss down? Or say screw it and let them melt away full tilt?"
keto,"My Keto Progress: 220-202lb in 5 weeks, Graph Included (M/23/5'10"")","Like many other people, quarantine hit pretty hard. So this month I wanted to make a change. I heard many great things about keto over the years so I decided to give it an honest try. I chose to do 5 weeks and I bought a scale to monitor my progress to see how keto impacted my body. 

I collected daily weight measurements first thing in the morning after using the bathroom. I recorded these measurements [here](https://imgur.com/a/P1ShOwv) to try and visualize my progress.

I lost about 18 pounds over the last 5 weeks! This has been my most successful attempt of losing weight I can remember, and honestly, it wasn't that hard to do. Idealistically, I would like to lose 20lbs more.

I found that I loved the controlled appetite and consistent energy. Though I found it difficult to introduce much variety in my diet, which got old after a while. Overall I would do it again, and I learned a lot about nutrition along the way.

I lurk this sub all the time, thanks for the motivation."
keto,Are polyols in gum consumed?,"This chemical is contained in sugarfree chewing gum, which I chew quite a bit off because it allows me to overcome acid reflux without drinking gallons of Gaviscon.

Is this the component that he’s never actually consumed or is this just another hidden sugar?"

keto,65 days into the Keto diet and I have not gotten any mental benefits.,"I've been on the Keto diet for 65 days now, eating less than 20 grams of carbs everyday. On day 50 I did cheat for 3 days by eating around 50-100 grams of carbs to try to get rid of the Keto Flu I had for weeks, but after that I went back to &lt;20 carbs with OMAD for a week to get back into ketosis.

Either way, it's been over 2 months of me doing Keto and I have not felt any significant mental health benefits. My mornings have been very sluggish, my mentality feels just as fine as before I did the diet. Physically I have lost around 10kg of weight since starting the diet, but I went into Keto for the supposed mental benefits it provides.

Right now I feel pretty skeptical about the ""Godlike state"" that Keto and Fat Adaptation is suppose to give you. With what I've been reading about ""mental clarity, more energy, etc"", it all sounds pretty subjective though?

Hopefully I'm wrong but it is a bit frustrating to have gone for this long on the diet without feeling much better mentally while reading that it should take about 4-8 weeks to reach Fat Adaptation. Fat Adaptations sounds absolutely amazing from the outside and I hope I can reach that state some day. 

Any thoughts? Advice? Personal experiences?"
keto,Water retention and working out,"I have been loosing weight steadily on a ketovore diet for many months.

Just started working out heavy about a week ago and the scale shows a 5 lb increase. My waist feels smaller than ever thou.  

What I do notice is that my watch feels tighter around my wrist and my chest, shoulders and legs are fuller. It appears that I'm either retaining water everywhere or inflammed everywhere due to muscle soreness.  I'm certain its not muscle growth because its only been one week

I would expect this from a heavy carbohydrate diet but not from a very low carb diet.  I'm wondering if this is a normal thing, has anybody experienced the same thing?"

I know, such madness, but it has helped me stay on track and not feel too sorry for myself. 

Does anyone have any other suggestions for “rubbish” food I can eat? Preferably store bought as my current state of mind is not suitable for any form domestic duty. 

Also, between PMSing and having my period I get to go a whole 16 days without weighing myself... really hoping for a good loss!

keto,Insomnia and High Blood pressure?,"I’m having an issue on Keto where I wake up and I can’t sleep, and I think that is electrolyte related because I eat something salty and I fall right asleep.

I’m 5’5 and about 180 lbs. I still have about 40 to lose before I’m at a healthy weight.

When I season my food and make my electrolyte drinks I usually add Lite Salt and Salt. Should I try just using Lite Salt instead since BP is an issue?

keto,I need help | 2 weeks fake keto + 4 days of calculated macro keto/20:4 IF,"Hello everyone,

I tried reading through the FAQ/beginner's guide and past posts to make sure I am not asking questions that were already answered. Most likely, they have been answered by the community and I overlooked. But please be patient with me as I am trying to learn as best as I can :)

**Summary** of myself before I start:

Goal: weight loss. 73kg (161lb) to 62kg (137lb)

Age: 29

Gender: male

Height: 173cm/5'7

Weight: currently 67.8kg (150lb)

How long am I into keto: 2 fake keto weeks + 3 days of calculated macro keto + 20:4IF.

Calories recommended by Keto calculator for weight loss: 1418

Athletic background: Just little, started BJJ/back to weight lifting but nothing serious. I currently have 4th rib injury from BJJ so all I can manage now is walking fast.

**What do I need help with**: I cannot seem to eat enough to hit my calories. I feel like throwing up if I tried to eat anymore.

*(Skip to* ***""Read from here""*** *if you don't want to read my long story)*

**Beginning**

One drunk night with my colleague, as always like functioning alcoholic. We randomly decided to lose 9kg/19.8lb (I thought I weight 71kg/157lb, but oh well I am hitting that 62kg) before end of the year. My colleague seemed to have gave up after 2 days, but hey. It's not about others, but everything is about me right? :D

**Fake 2 weeks Keto (lost 2kg/4.4lb)**

No macro calculation, just not eating anything that I consider are carbs. Had keto flu on 2nd or 3rd day and I felt fine afterwards. I still binge drank alcohol 2-3 times a week but no cheating.

So I guess I wasn't too horrible in a fine line of Keto :) ...?

**Real 4 days of keto + 20:4 IF (lost exactly 1kg/2.2lb)**

5 days ago, I stumbled across this community, and I decided to go all the way if I'm gonna do this. I tried to read all the info as much as I could including FAQ/beginner's guide, and other previous posts too. Then, I went, what the hell I'm gonna do 20:4 intermittent fasting too. Go hard or go home. Except alcohol....

1st day, just remember being hungry. 

2nd day, woke up at 3.30am and couldn't go back to sleep. Struggle was real, I collapsed after eating my dinner at 8pm.

3rd day, slept like a baby I only had cravings for carbs but not really hungry at all. I ""had"" to do OMAD 23:1 because I just could not eat more.

Today? It would be nice to have my mother's Korean pork kimchi hotpot and smash 4 bowls of white rice with dried seasweed and fried eggs, but meh. When I thought about eating most healthiest veges raw (aka kale), I straight away knew that it was just craving.

I've been doing average 12km/7.5 miles fast walking past 4 days as I can't do anything more due to rib injury.

**(Read from here)**

Now, here is the difficulty I am having. it is so difficult to eat more than 1000 calories. (1832-&gt;1205-&gt;1054-&gt;600 today, max 700). Believe me when I say this, I am a big believer in ""you don't stop eating when you are full, you stop when you feel sick"". I use to devour 720g/1.6lb of pure Korean BBQ with hotpot, side dishes, drink 4 bottles of soju and quietly make myself ramen at home to cure my future hangover so I don't get trouble by my CFO..I mean wife :)

I have no problem with eating less than 20g carbs except I have to be careful with veges (eating small amounts of  cabbage, kale, celery, cucumber &amp; carrots ). Fat, I just do not care as long as I have few avocado or ghee butter/coconut oil. 

But protein, my favourite nutrient protein...I cannot seem to eat them. I tried beef, lamb, chicken and eggs. But my protein intake is reducing 155g-&gt;119g-&gt;88g-&gt;53g (today). I cannot eat anymore or I feel like throwing up. I was forced to start OMAD 24:1 yesterday with a soup but even then I could not finish. I bought fish, bacon and pork belly today so I give them a try.

Has anybody experienced this?  Should I be concerned? I don't care if I eat this little as long as I won't stuff up my metabolism and health.

Much appreciated for your assistance in advance."
keto,"Help, not feeling good","Hi! I’m new to keto, this is my first week and it was prescribed to me by my doctor because it could help with my migraines, so I’m not on a calorie deficit. I thought this would mean that I would have the same ‘energy’ as before, just without eating certain foods.
The problem is that since I started I always have a really bad headache, I’m always shaking and when I stand up and do something that requires energy I feel like I’m about to pass out.
I wanted to ask you if this is normal, did you experience the same thing? Or should I maybe stop? Please let me know how you’re experience has been so I know what to do. Thank you!"

I’m looking at some of the sweeteners and I’m not sure what to think about them (sorbitol mannitol sucralose and xylitol) I know sucralose is ok in it’s liquid state and xylitol is ok as well but I’m unsure about the other 3.

I'm here posting because today, my phone decided that it wanted to show me some old photos (rude imo, how dare they think I wanted to see the picture of my ex that I thought I deleted. Alas, I digress) and I saw a picture of what I looked like in early 2019. I couldn't believe the difference I see in myself now vs. that picture. I never really see anything different when I look in the mirror, but seeing what I looked like then side by side with what I look like now? Woah. I just wanna say, stick to it, it's worth it!

keto,Is Keto just CICO really?,"If Keto is just a means to the end that is CICO, as many suggest here, then why is it necessarily important to be ""in ketosis""?

Why does switching from glycogen to fat as an energy source matter if its all just CICO?"
keto,Strict Keto but still experiencing brain fog,"Been mainly eating meat and dairy products, but I have still been experiencing infrequent brain fog. I am not entirely carnivore because it effects my digestive system too much (constipation). My main meals are usually fatty beef or fatty pork with melted cheese. As a snack I usually eat yogurt with berries, nut butter and cocao powder. Or the same as a smoothie.

I am thinking that the cheese might be the issue here especially because I have it frequently with meals and as a snack.

Been drinking plenty of water. But my sleep has been off a bit lately so that could also be another reason.

keto,Does your weight loss even out when you reach a healthier weight or do you need to push your calories up until you maintain?,"So I’m only a week in and yes it’s probably mostly water, but I am thrilled to have lost 10.6 pounds. My calories have averaged about 2300 a day, felt full after 1600 cals one day (plus was just too busy and tired to fit another meal in) but the next needed 2700 to make sure I didn’t think about carbs. Had I had ‘balanced’ meals this last week I would’ve certainly maintained my weight, if not at least put on some. On MFP I’ve chosen 2500 cals a day. Obviously the 2nd week will be telling.

But I am wondering what some experienced keto dieters journeys with calories has been? I’m only counting calories to make sure im doing it right this time as I’ve failed before on just intuitive eating."

keto,"Mods, FYI I think the Potassium Recommendation in the FAQ is missing a 0","The FAQ suggests 300 mg of Potassium, but every link I can find online suggests 3000-4000 mg.

I tried to post sources in my first post attempt but apparently I'm ""using a URL shorterner"" by copying and pasting urls? Anyway, fuck your hoops, I'm not jumping through them.

I am not a doctor and don't know who the person in the FAQ is that suggests the 300 mg, but my guess is, either he is wrong or more likely it was typed up incorrectly. His other recommendations are correct when compared to other sources.

keto,Its end of my 2nd day of keto and i feel incredible.,Its end of my 2nd day of keto and i feel incredible. I caught myself laughing for 30min straight i dont know what this is hut i have urge to laugh over and over again this is so strange for me. I tried keto 3 times before but i have quit at the end of first week every single time because i do it only for mental clarity not for weight loss. I dont know if something like this can happen in day 2 but maybe its because i have tried it 3 times before as i have mentioned before.

keto,I'm a postman. I'm considering Keto but have a few questions..,"I am a postal worker and I have read that on Keto you have to drink a lot more water and even ketosis is a diaretic. At the moment I avoid or drink very little during my shift (7.30pm to about 2.30pm) as it's difficult to find a toilet or a suitable hedge that's not on someone's property. I make up by drinking plenty the rest of the day. Is this really a big a problem as it sounds needing the toilet regularly on Keto? Any fellow posties out there? 

I have a week off soon so plan to trial the diet then as I don't want to have keto flu whilst delivering with heavy bags for 12 miles. It's quite a physical job these days. Any tips to avoid or reduce the feelings of fatigue?

Lastly I'm hoping to lose a bit of weight but I want it to reduce my anxiety and give me more focus. I am on anti depressants for anxiety and have suffered chronic morning fatigue for several years. I would love to come off the pills one day. I've tried many things, hopefully this diet can help me? Any advice would be appreciated. TIA."

Cheers keto family!"
keto,Electrolyte help - kosher salt?,I tried to find this answer before posting - I’m doing lite salt and kosher salt mix which is working well for me. I’m almost out of kosher salt but I have a ton of regular salt. Do I need to be using regular or kosher salt for my sodium requirements or does it not matter? Thank you!

keto,"Need help, I've plateaued.","Hello, 
As the title suggests, I may have hit a wall here.


For context, I'm on keto and if (16:8/18:6) for the past 6 months. I've lost weight at a good pace, around 5 kgs or 11 lbs per month minimum. If I had a good run, it would go upto 6 or even 7 kgs. 



But for the last 2 months, I have lost less than 2-3 kgs.
Now I know some would say that's still progress, but it really isn't, considering that I am doing keto for the whole month with only 1 cheat day, and I F 18:6 for the past month and 20:4 since the past 2 weeks. Those are pretty strict conditions to subject yourself to (atleast by my standards).



Here's stats, macros and cals intake.
5'9 88kgs/193lbs Male 27 y/o


Kcals per day - around 1300-1400
Protien - 100 G
Total carbs (with fibres) - 38g
NET CARBS  ( minus fibres) - 23g
Fibres - 15g
Fat - 85G



Yes I use a food scale, and I supplement Protien, as a vegetarian, it's extremely difficult to eat enough protein to prevent muscle loss. (As I've learnt from experience, I lost a lot of muscle mass)



So, is this simply a slump that I will just have to wait through, or is something wrong with my macros or approach? 



Should I add mct oil to the diet? 


Any help is appreciated."
keto,Coconut Water and Coconut Milk,"Is the former allowed on Keto? I know that Atkins allows for it, but I've seen mixed reviews when it comes to Keto.

As to Coconut Milk, why are the unsweetened varieties so unappetizing? I've made Coconut Milk from scratch with no added sugar, and it tastes nothing like the watery mess that is unsweetened Coconut Milk."
keto,"I have reached Onederland, some graphs, and a gentle reminder that we're all running a marathon here and not a sprint &lt;3","Hey guys, 

So let this be your reminder that weight loss is a gradual process. We are all running a marathon and not a sprint. 

If you click the link below you can see my gradual losses in CM, measured on 4 spots, from June until today. 
https://ibb.co/ng7VJnq 

It doesn't look that shocking if you put it in a graph, but it is still a a wopping 29,5"" (or 75cm) that I have lost :D 
These centimeter losses correspond with going from 233 lbs (106kg) to 194 lbs (88 kg) which is a 39lbs (18 kg) loss (And also: YAY I have reached ONEderland!)
This has been the easiest diet for me to follow ever and my knees don't hurt anymore when I go for a long walk. 

Still 13 - 18 kg to go, but I am over halfway there. Once I reach my goal of 75 to 70 kg I will post the whole before-after picture shebang."
keto,Not every Google return claiming,"a given item is Keto is accurate.

keto,"Greatest Diet Ever ( Face Gains plus Meal Pics) (6'2"" Male)","http://imgur.com/gallery/LebPo7V

       Started doing keto January of this year and went from 235 lbs to 180 lbs. I've tried other diets in the past and have found success in losing significant weight but have just never been able to keep it off. I'm a pretty big eater and it seemed like I would have to make such a consious effort to be at a weight that I was happy and confident at but my default mode would always send me back to the 220-235 range which I felt overweight at. Discovered keto and losing the weight and keeping it off has never been easier. I've legitimately found something that works so well for me that dieting just isnt a conscious effort at all anymore and keto is just the way that I choose to eat.

       After starting in January at 235 lbs I ended up at 180 lbs around July and have just been maintaining since. I was perfect for the first couple months, never going over 20 net carbs a day, but as time went on and I saw such amazing results, I became alittle more relaxed with it. Now I pretty much just eat keto all the time but if a special occasion comes around I just enjoy it and hop back on the next day. No biggie

       The link above is a pic of me about one year apart on 2 backpacking trips I went on. First was August 2019 and the second was September 2020. Felt significantly on the 2nd one for sure and stuck to keto on the trail. Also included some of my go to keto meal pics.

       If any of you are just starting keto the #1 advice that I would give is just to stick with it because it gets so much easier. Those craving for carbs goes away completely after a week or 2 as your body converts to running on fat instead of carbs and sugar. Once you're past that it seriously becomes so incredibly easy and satisfying. 

Most Consumed Foods: Ground Beef, Cauliflower Rice, Pickles, Bacon, Eggs, Macadamia Nuts, Nutzo Keto Butter, Asparagus and whenever I needed a cheat day I'd buy 2 lbs of chicken wings, bake them at home and eat all of them. What diet is easier than that?"
keto,"About to quit, convince me otherwise","Been on keto, but more specifically carnivore diet, omad for the past two months now, I'm posting it here because this sub is the largest and most active/diverse of the bunch.

So during the ""journey"" dropped some weight, mind is clearer, some food cravings are gone but other than that nothing much has changed, sometimes I have difficulty with digestion, sometimes I have intense cravings that come and go, my mental issues while being more manageable overall are still persistent.

Along with keto I also started doing way more sports, sleeping better (at least 7 hours a day at consistent hours) and before I switched to keto/carni about two months ago I was eating quite healthy as well for about half a year, just more starchy vegetables and stuff.

Anyway other that controlling weight, and boy do I control it well, I eat 3000-4000 calories a day and my bmi remains stable at 21 all throughout (of course the calories come mostly from fat). But other than that there's absolutely nothing else, the fact that my mind is clearer is probably more to my improved sleeping schedule than the diet, and while having stable energy levels throughout the day is nice, I never have any spikes in energy where I feel like the king of the world, which makes doing sports harder than it should be, especially since I do intense calisthenics and explosive power is something I'm looking for.

Aside from that I just think about food all day, no matter how occupied I am food is always on my mind, and this is my main reason for wanting to quit, I don't even have cravings, I'm just tired that my mind constantly thinks about food, everywhere I look there is a good that I can't eat and it's just distracting and making me feel miserable all the time.

keto,Sub clinical Reactive hypoglycemia symptoms,"Hi all,

4 yrs back I did keto lost 25kg. 2yrs back I had hit premature menopause slided in depression, added carbs to one meal. But ended up gaining 20kg back and also now I have high fasting insulin 18. So I understand am insulin resistant. Good thing is I started keto 2 weeks back.

 I eat 3 meals 6hr gap 1300cals protein around 80 fat 90 net carbs 20 to 25g . Electrolytes mag glycinate 600mg sodium comes to around 5g now (1.5-2 tsp pink salt and food) and potassium around 3g( 3 to 4 dash of lite salt n from food ). The salt I have says 1g has 700mg of potassium n 300mg of sodium).  
I have small food to work with. I dont want to add anymore of electrolytes to food coz i cant eat them. Cant add any more water coz already I feel nauseated with this amount of water.

My query is, if If feel the subclinical signs of hypoglycemia,  what should I do? Can I eat some nuts? Cheese?

This symptom comes like an episode while I go for a 30 min walk, it hits me suddenly after 20 mins, blurry vision, weak legs, sweaty, foggy, dizzy by the end of which I add in the anxiety.  Because it suddenly hits me, I feel this is reactive hypoglycemia ..also hapoens 3 to 4 hrs after meal untill then am all fine. All the while am taking in electrolytes. Subclinical coz may be it is not true hypoglycemia with low sugar.

Today morning fasting blood sugar was 79. Just 3 days back doc asked me to take metformin 500 before breakfast. After 1hr of food it was 109.  Just after 3 days now my other doc who approves keto has asked me to cut metformin to 250.

I just want to know how to deal with this at the moment it happens while I am out walking.  Long term this keto will take care."

Its keeps it stagnant and I don't loose as fast as I originally have been. I'll admit I haven't disciplined myself to just pass on a drink, because I've been so uncomfortable in my skin and struggle with anxiety, having that drink takes the edge off and allows me to enjoy myself and be good company. Im starting to feel disappointment the next 3 days and im hard on myself so I limit what I eat because I feel so bloated but I'm also not as hungry. I have a bad habit of testing my ketone via urine strip and not once have I been knocked out of ketosis.. even after drinking.. im ready to stop drinking and embrace this journey of weight loss and reach my goal. Have any of you been in this situation before? How did you overcome? Best ways to just pass on the drinking and feel proud about it?

Checking out my face to see if I can see my contours better,  my side view to see if it is thinner. Its pretty time consuming and draining.  I distract myself by doing other stuff, but still these thoughts crop up. 

Those times I tell myself: losing weight is like toilet paper. You wont see in the beginning.  But it keeps coming off like the tissue bit by bit and just as TP gets over, so does weight comes off. Hope that's motivation to others who are going through this.  😅"

keto,"12,000,000 little cuties","Did you hear that CoViD-19 mutated in Denmark amongst the domesticated minks that caught it.  There is talk of having to kill every domesticated mink in Denmark; more than 12 million I think.

Here's the problem.  The authorities don't yet even know whether this new bug is merely different, worse, or better than what we already have.  They are worried that any vaccine that we develop *might* not work with the mink version of the bug.  So they wanna kill 12 million innocent domesticated cuties because of what *might* happen.

This problem illustrates what is wrong with the authority's **entire approach** to this and every other infectious disease.  They are saying exactly zip about people building up their immune strength.  It is all about the transmission of the disease, not our general level of health.  They focus on people in the most superficial way, without any thinking that perhaps people can be taught to build their immune strength.

I am not against science.  I am for **MORE** science, the science that has helped many people build their immune strength.  The medical authorities act like there is no such science and is no such thing.  That is really *very unscientific* of them since there are plenty of studies and case histories of people building their immune strength.

Our health authorities have some kind of unspoken bias that causes them to treat people like objects and not living, breathing, **adapting** people who have living, breathing, **adapting** immune systems that can be improved upon.   

So, when we win against this bug, then there will be some other bug to come along, and that will also cause problems because no one bothered to make themselves healthier in general.  When we get this vaccine for CoViD-19, it will help us very little if any with the next bug that comes along.  If something really different like Ebola breaks out, the vaccine for CoViD-19 will have helped us exactly **ZERO**.  

But efforts to build your immune strength will help you immensely no matter what bug shows up.  And I **GUARANTEE** that there will be more bugs coming along, particularly in a country that feeds its children Sugar Snaps for breakfast and doesn't even think of that as child abuse."
keto,Struggling slightly on my protein macro.,"Hey all, this is my first post here, so I'll start with my macros first.  


185g Protein  
30 Carbs (Might have to dip down to 20, idk)  
178g Fat  
2460 Calories  


Today as an example, I've hit:

146g Protein  
24 carbs  
177g Fat  
2342 Calories - No workout done yet  


As far as protein goes, I'm not sure if that's too little or if it's fine. I see a lot of people pushing for hitting or exceeding protein macro, so I'm looking for some guidance.  


I have a bit of a weird restriction for fridge space, as I'm living with my parents and grandmother along with my sisters, so fridge and freezer space can get pretty tight. What I've been doing is easy since my sister had a mini fridge downstairs I could use for my vegetables, main meal and some shakes. I do have a couple things fat wise I know I can cut, but I still need some help on at least reaching my protein macro.

So for this my daily meals currently look like this:  


Breakfast - 3 Eggs and 4 Slices of bacon with an Atkins protein shake, either Dark chocolate or Mocha Latte.  


I wake up at around 12 PM, so that's when I eat breakfast, my snacks vary day to day. Currently my sister is letting me try a bunch of different keto cereals/chips she's been buying, and I also usually stock up on some Atkins candies, which I've heard some mixed things about, so I might start ditching those for the quest brand instead.

Lunch/Dinner - This is surely one of my fat problems, but I'm lazy and these are easy, so I go with some Oscar Meyer Classic Beef Uncured Franks; I eat one of the two bags from the package, so 5 links. I also like these cause they don't take too much room in the mini fridge I can use. Sometimes this is replaced with various tuna creations from Starkist, but not too often. And along with either option is some broccoli florets. Another note for me, is that I'll typically order some wings for lunch (usually with ranch which I should start cutting out cause it's just unnecessary fat) on my weekend days which are the days I end up getting the most protein.  


And then if I'm not too lazy, I'll end my day by doing some exercise with ring fit adventure to burn some calories, about 30 minutes on the in game timer, usually burning around 200-300 calories.  


So, I'm looking for some suggestions for an easy meal and/or snack(s) I can eat daily that won't eat up too much fridge space and help me reach my protein macro. I know my sister grabs two rotisserie chickens for her meals each week and I've seen those suggested before. I don't know how well they'll fit in my fridge, but I suppose I can try them one week and cut it up into portions in ziploc bags or something. Beyond that, I'm at a loss."

keto,4 month keto update! From 285 to 205.1!,"Reference: 26m 5'8 starting weight of 285. Down to 205.1 as of this morning.

&amp;#x200B;

As the title reads this is a short update on my keto journey. I started on July 6, just for fun, when texting with a friend about it. For years he had always raved about keto and how much he loved it. I never really gave it any attention back then. This time was different though. I decided to try it just because I knew I was obese and figured what's the harm in giving it a try. Needless to say it was easily the best decision I made this year. In those short 4 months I've managed to go down 79.9lbs. My weight goal is to be around 180lbs and I'm so close to it. Originally it was to be under 200 by the end of 2020 and I've managed to  shattered through that. I should be under 200lbs within the next 2 weeks, maybe less. The reason I'm making this post is to thank everyone who actively visits this subreddit! I don't post much but I do come here to read others stories! It's always been amazing to see how many people find success on keto and just how positive this community is. To anyone reading this, starting off, I hope my story can help motivate you into sticking with it! I've read some crazy success stories on here and they always kept me pushing. I'll post again, once I hit my weight goal, and make a more in detail post about my daily routine and my overall experience on keto! Once again, thank you everyone!!"

keto,Tips and tricks for digestive issues? Desperate for help!,"Hi all,

So I've been contemplating keto for a while not only for weight loss but because I also have a rare skin condition (chronic scalp folliculitis) that for many people only abates when they switch to the diet. 

I did keto for about a week, and my routine was to do 1 Keto Chow shake per day (using avocado oil) and then 1 big meal (generally like 700-900 cal) that would usually be a burrito bowl-type thing with chicken, cheese, low carb veggies, sour cream, etc. (would sometimes sub in Chipotle or Five Guys burger bowls but everything matched up in terms of macros). 

The results on my skin condition were great! Inflammation went down a lot and I could tell the bumps were crusting up and starting to disappear. Unfortunately, I could not stay on the diet, as that entire week I had some of the most severe stomach pain and GI distress I've ever had :( I was going to the bathroom 4-5 times a day, often doubled over in pain, and while it wasn't always liquid, it never got more solid than a few soft pieces. I know people say that this is just a transition period and to tough through it, and I really did try, enduring it for 5 days, but I have another medical condition that makes it so that even 2-3 days of diarrhea is extremely painful for me and leaves my butt insanely sore to the point that I was applying lotion and ointments after every movement just to try and heal up a bit. So ""toughing through it"" is not really an option for me. 

I really really don't want to give up on this diet, so I'm hoping you guys can tell me every possible trick you have to do keto without ripping through your insides. Is there a particular food I can focus on that would help in this regard (probably if I focused heavily on leafy greens or something)? I'm not an amazing cook and don't have a ton of time, but I can meal prep and also don't mind buying food. Other things I'm considering/planning to do on next attempt are: 

- Start Keto Chow later, I think too much liquid fat at the beginning could be a problem (also buying beef gelatin for when I do eventually use it again)
- Ease in, slowly ramping up fat and bringing down carbs week by week to give my body more time to adjust
- Maybe just do low-carb period for a while and see if I get the same effects, rather than go straight to sub-20. 

Any advice would be appreciated - thank you!!"

I lost 36 pounds since i started in late August and I needed new leggings like asap.  and i had slimmed into that pesky sports bra.   So i had no excuse.  And i had spent the day on Destiny 2 so was feeling desperate for some movement.   I said to my boyfriend i was going to try and as it was now bight he was a bit worried about it.  As i started i began to realise how slippery it was out on the mud and wet leaves and feeling self conscious and scared in the dark... i went straight home.

Bummer.   My boyfriend could see i was dissapointed and suggested we have dinner (i start fasting at eight so i couldnt eat after)  and go for a walk.   He suggested i try and keep pace with him and after half way round our usual lap i suggested i run for a bit.  and i did.  it was in small bursts but... i went on my first jog ^^

This'll be great to add to what i already do :)  I can't wait to be able to jog the whole lap ^^

keto,Can’t just quite get there,Hi all! I’ve been on and off keto since June.

keto,I just discovered the best keto cheesecakes...,"This is a public service announcement. I've been on and off the keto bandwagon but this year during quarantine, I really doubled down....and I lost 20 lbs in 4 weeks!!!   


The biggest thing for me was kicking my sweet tooth by finding the right alternatives and adjusting my mindset. I discovered wunder cheesecakes SNACK BARS and they have changed my life. They are already in the perfect portion and helps me stay in my carb count. Only 3 net carbs and using healthy ingredients. I saw the englightened cheesecake and unfortunately, it was FULL of gums. Did not like that.  


I bought mine online and it came frozen with dry ice :) [https://eatwunder.com/products/cheesecake-snack-bars](https://eatwunder.com/products/cheesecake-snack-bars) 

  
Sharing with everyone because I know how hard it is to find tasty snacks that satisfy your cravings!! Keep on going yall!! There are so many people making food for us now :) It makes me very motivated."
keto,Good Coffee Creamer Replacement,"I’ve been on and off keto for a few years with pretty good success but the one thing I struggled to find a replacement for is coffee creamer.

keto,"Caught the rona, need tips to stay on track","Hey hey

So I caught covid, tested positive yesterday, with symptoms that have progressively gotten worse since about Thursday. I'm an ICU nurse and while I think I lasted this long partially bc of keto and vitamin d supplements, my body gave in and here I am.

My question is, what can I do to stay on track? I have bone broth, which I've been sipping and some other low carb soups but the thought of eating fat or meat makes me super nauseous. All I'm craving are saltines and other carbs. I was able to eat some almonds without much trouble but I'm kind of at a loss at the moment on what to do. Part of me wants to take a break from keto and do cico until I get better. Thanks in advance."
keto,How would I eat more fat than protein on keto?,"I'm looking into starting the keto diet and apparently you're supposed to eat more fat than protein and if you eat too much protein you can prevent your body from going into ketosis. I've been looking at common keto foods and pretty much all of them have more protein than fat. Beef, eggs, pork, chicken, and most fish have more protein than fat. Is it fine for me to eat mainly these foods (+low carb vegetables)? It seems incredibly hard to eat more fat than protein unless you're only eating bacon and avocados.

I'm sorry if this is a dumb question, I'm just pretty confused about this."

keto,Unable to do Keto diet in India.,"In thinking about stopping keto.

I realized I needed to do something after I bought a pair of pants with a 42 inch inseam and they were too tight.

It’s actually been quite easy for me if I’m being honest, and I thought it was going to be significantly harder than it has been.

keto,[PICS] I shared a full length transformation post yesterday but thought I would share my facial transformation today after 32lbs lost on Keto.,"Hi,

I'm not sure if you seen my other post in this subreddit but had a few comments on face changing a lot. I thought I'd post again with pics that show the change in my face since I started keto and lost 32lbs.

Hopefully this inspires you to start keto, or keep going!! This is only after a few months on keto and I'm beyond excited for the future and having further progress!

keto,Flaxseed/hemp oil for dry skin?,"I've only been doing the keto diet for a couple of weeks, but when I initially started I noticed I was getting really dry skin, where it would get red and flakey in spots on my face and scalp. Kind of unpleasant.

I asked my friend (who has done keto for over a year) about it and he said he had the same problem until he began taking hemp and flaxseed oil.

So a week ago I bought some hemp and flaxseed oil and started taking a spoonful of both each morning. Sure enough, the dry skin started to diminish, and as of today they are no dry/flakey spots anymore. 

I don't know if they did indeed help it, or if it just coincided with my body getting adjusted to keto or figuring it out on it's own, or even if one helped it and the other didn't, because I take an equal amount of both. 

Just wondering if anyone had a similar experience with flaxseed and/or hemp oil?"
keto,[UPDATE] 60 days in and I am the lightest I have been in past 2 years,"Hi everyone! 

Just yo girl, doing her regular monthly update, trying to conform to the ""healthy outlook"" subscription I started exactly two months back. 

So I am happy to report that I am 20 lbs down from my starting weight. Roughly 10 kilos (cuz I am Indian lol) out of 60 kilos that I am determined to lose. 

Which is a big achievement for me because I have been such a lazy slob before this. Nothing else worked for me before and I was the most discouraged person ever. 

This, however, works and works well! And this is my effort, this is me sticking to a promise I made to myself and not deviating at all. 

I haven't cheated once. 

Sure, I snack on some keto chocolates once in a while. Sure, I am not able to go for a walk everyday. 

But each day is progress - the magnitude of the step doesn't matter as long as it's progressive. 

Anywho, this is a picture of me on [the 50th day of my keto journey](http://imgur.com/a/6zKyaFF) in the same t-shirt as the original photo on left.

Believe me, as some one who has been severely overweight (and still is), this diet and life style is a very easy change.

I should note, I am fairly underweight 28 yr old male at 51kg at 1.76 meters, with not a lot of lean muscle mass, so perhaps this is affecting my sodium needs?(steadily gaining weight to get to a healthier weight).

 I'm curious to hear from long term ketoers how their salt intake has changed post adaptation, and what their recommendations might be."
keto,80lbs down to lowest weight in close to 20 years,"I remember first being aware of my weight as a freshman in high school but it was always that I needed to lose maybe 10 or 20 lbs.  Senior year went on a diet and got down from 225 to around 170.  For 6’3” that was thin and for my frame it was extremely thin.  in college I put on weight but at that age very small adjustments and I would lose at a rapid clip.  A couple years after college I again went on a more serious diet and got down to around 190 using Atkins.  My weight began steadily creeping and my son was born around 11 years ago and he was premature and growth restricted.  So he was in the NICU for 3 months.  The weight piled on during this time and the subsequent months from the stress.  From that point in I was obese and getting more so.  3 years ago I did keto with great success then put the weight back on, though still around 25lbs from my highest weight.  I am now more than 10lbs lighter than I got 3 years ago and close to the weight I got married at.  In addition i did in patient rehab and am now clean since 3/21.

keto,My journey so far with Keto.,"Hi all,

I just wanted to say this subreddit is one of the sole reasons I decided to give Keto a second try. My first attempt lasted 11 months and I lost 65 pounds (SW: 295lbs and EW: 230lbs). I got off Keto after my wife and I got into a head-on accident with a drunk driver. Our car ended up spinning off the road and flipping over. Thankfully, we made it out of the accident with no major injuries (neck and back muscle spasms along with concussions and some minor cuts from the glass), but the emotional toll that it took on us drove me into deep depression. My cope? Eating copious amounts of food to feel something other than worthless. 

This lead to me becoming the heaviest I have ever been in my life. I weighed in at 320.8 lbs back in August of 2020. Morale was WAY down and I started to get even more depressed. That is when I was scrolling through reddit and read someone's keto success story. It nearly brought me to tears. Someone overcame being over 400 lbs and was now where they had always dreamt of being. This story lit a fore in me to get back to it!

I am a 26 yo Male 6'0"" SW 325.4 CW: 301.8 GW: 200. I started this journey on October 27th this year, and I already have lost 23.6 lbs! I just want to say to everyone here, thank you for helping inspire me to get my life back on track. Y'all are simply amazing! I'm sorry for the long post, but I don't have anyone else to share this with. I am in this for the long run, and will be sharing my milestones with y'all :) thank you for reading! KCKO!!!"

keto,Keto and cholesterol— if someone is taking meds for high cholesterol should they not try keto?,"Started keto because I wanted to lose weight &amp; get healthy but I have high cholesterol— should I stop keto?

I can’t seem to find a straight answer on google. 

So I have been eating really unhealthy for the last year. I am 5’8 &amp; weigh 210lbs! 

Before I started letting myself go I was powerlifting and eating clean(ish) I weighed 175-180 and was very very active (including at work since I worked construction at the time) 

I have done Keto before &amp; lost a lot of excess weight &amp; felt great so I know it works. Last time I did keto for a few months I got down to 162! 

The only difference is this: I have high cholesterol now. 

Last week I weighed myself and said enough. I’m going back on Keto but around 3 days in I went to the doc for an unrelated issue which they did some tests on me and told me I have high blood pressure &amp; high cholesterol. They even gave me medication. 

It’s atorvastatin 20mg taken once at bed time. 

And they gave me a pamphlet saying what foods to avoid and it says don’t eat butter, red meat etc. 

I guess my question is this: I’ve done keto before but I was very healthy to begin with now I am not. Since I have high cholesterol should I not try keto? I know last time I told my doc I was on keto she rolled her eyes &amp; was not supportive."

So I’m not here to lose weight, I’m plenty thin enough. I’m here because of my thoughts that I could have candida overgrowth.

I don’t have health insurance, and initially thought it was lactose intolerance. But the gas would come from eating fried foods, and sometimes I just have it and don’t know what from. It’s led to constipation too. I feel it started from long term dose of antibiotics during my freshman year of high school to fight off MRSA. 

I am here because the diet to control/starve candida is very keto-like. I’m curious if anyone has had a similar problem to mine or if they could offer some words of advice. It’s become a rather uncomfortable way to live. Cheers"
keto,Which animal fats go best with which foods?,"I bought some lard, tallow and duck fat recently.  And I have some ghee. Do some animal fats go better with some foods more than others?  

I plan to cook fish, eggs and steak and other stuff at some point. 

My mom used to cook with lard, but never with the others, so I don't know anything about them. 

And my understanding is that the fat can absorb the taste of the food sometimes so that if you save and re-use some it might be good to re-use it for the same or similar food.  

For example, if I regularly use one for fish, maybe I would always want to use that one with only fish.  Or is that not correct?"

2 years ago at 490 pounds I would have considered this as my appetizer and now at 225 im almost full!!

keto,My parents won't let me go keto what should I do?,I'm a minor I'm at 220lbs and I gained 30lbs since covid stared and have been struggling with weight loss for a while. I asked my mom about trying this and she said it was unhealthy and bad for you. How can I change her mind?
keto,Supportive friends!,"I started keto about 5 months ago and I have been basically on the lazy side of Keto. I’ve lost 30 pounds and I’ve felt so much better about myself and have felt so much energy come back! Anywho, what I have found has helped me the most is having supportive friends that are soooo accommodating without even asking. They are just so sweet! My birthday is coming up and we will be working so they threw me a surprise birthday dinner that had so many keto options for me but also good for the rest of the guests. We had a election night “party” and again they had so many keto snack/drink options. All of this without even asking. Of course they have all the snacks and treats they love too but it’s means a lot that they would include things for me. It’s the little things that really help."
keto,Eating disorder trigger warning,"Hi! I just joined and I have been on a keto diet since November 1st. I researched  for about 2 months and after, I started a journal based on my information gathered and I keep a record of my intake (so far). I am excited for this because I have had eating disorders more than half my life. I also have severe depression and anxiety, symptoms I mostly attribute to my ED, but more easily treatable. So far this diet has kept me from binging and purging. This leads me to seek the answer to the question posing: does purging occasional meals that dont bolster the low carb high fat doctrine throw off my ketosis? Even if all my other meals are prudently picked for Keto, is it possible? If there’s anyone else who has had ED prior to keto, can you please reply or contact me?"
keto,Fsteak,Id appreciate any info. Does eating all your protein at once vs throughout the day change how its utilized by your body? I drive a truck for a living and find it difficult to stop often so figured omad would suit me best on my schedule. But I want a second opinion
keto,Taking longer,"Hello, I done keto for 5 weeks about 2.5 months ago. I lost 15lbs, but then went on vacation and gained it all back. It was always my intention to go back on keto because I have a total of about 35lbs to lose and it love it as a lifestyle. This time I find that it’s taking longer for the weight to shift and I feel a bit demotivated. I have been on it for 2.5 weeks and only lost 3lbs. I’m eating like I was previously, less than 20g carbs, 1250 cals, exercising. Please let me know if you’ve been through something similar. I’m 5,3, female, 166lbs."
keto,Accidental keto? help,"Just a disclaimer, i didn't intentionally try to begin this diet, but i feel it was brought on given my circumstances &amp; would like to confirm if it sounds like i'm on this path or not.

Lately i've been feeling shakey and weak. i can still write and do my job, i just feel wierd.

I've not really been eating, im sure my carbs are atleast below 50g a day which could cause keto

It feels like my body just wants to sleep all the time but i've still got enough energy to do my work, albiet in a hazy state.

I have poor concentration, not sure if it's mental fog or just stress

sugars have become disgusting, and i can eat meats, salty ones taste especially good.  
But... I've lost my appetite in general, i'm not hungry.

I didn't really feel thirsty until today, i drank about 3 liters of water from 8:30-11am and i was continously nipping to the bathroom, i didn't feel sick despite the sheer volume of water i drank.

Everyone has been telling me i need to eat food, but my body tells me otherwise.

I went to several doctors with these symptoms and they all attributed it to anxiety but i felt it was more diet oriented as my ""anxiety"" never caused the shakiness before. i have tried eating but i can't seem to stomach it so maybe my better direction would be to get onto keto if my symptoms are of it

Sorry if i wasted anybodies time here, Just lost in the world and looking for an answer to how i feel :)"
keto,I can’t seem to find a good sweetener,"I am relatively new to keto. I have been experimenting with various sugar substitutes. I have found that xylitol upsets my stomach. It was recommended that I try swerve but I found it to be horrible. It has this weird aftertaste that seems to coat my tongue. I had the same issue with stevia. 

I have always been a great fan of sweets. I fear that it will be my downfall if I don’t find a good sugar substitute. Which sweeteners have you found to taste “normal”? Is there any trick to mask or remove that weird swerve aftertaste?"
keto,Confusion with carbs and fiber,"Hi all! I am 7 weeks into eating a ketogenic diet and I’ve been successful so far, I’ve lost 20 pounds and have 20 more to go. Sticking to under 30 net carbs per day right now.

I recently purchased some keto “sweet treats” from a website smart baking company. They have things like muffins and small cakes. I tried them &amp; they’re delicious! I don’t plan to eat these everyday but just incase I get the craving. I did notice on the nutrition facts it states there are 20 g of carbs per muffin and then there is 12 g fibers 8 g erythritol and 9 g protein per muffin. The box advertises 0 net carbs.

Should I be worried about the carbs in this item, even though they’re essentially “cancelled out” you’re still taking in the carbs, right? This is where I get confused. Same thing with low carb tortillas that have a lot of fiber added. I’ve heard people say just throwing fiber into a high carb food isn’t necessary keto friendly. I’m looking for feedback if it’s something you personally find to be completely okay or it something to watch out for? I just don’t want to mess up my progress."
keto,Keto appetite and insomnia,"I'm going to cut to the chase. I just finished a long term fast 3 days ago and have reintroducing calories over the past couple of days.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm definitely in ketosis as as was on a water fast, but now that I'm introducing higher levels of fat into my diet, my stomach doesn't feel so good. The first day was fine as I only ate a few calories (\~800) of lean protein (pork, white fish, protein powder). Yesterday, I began reintroducing some fats and increased my calories. Last night my stomach was churning from the fatty steak I ate for dinner and I didn't sleep very well.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning, my appetite had returned and my stomach was feeling much better so I decided to start with a bulletproof coffee (36g fat). Now here it is at lunch time and my stomach is churning away still, even thinking about food makes me feel ill. Maybe I will feel better by dinner, but I really don't want to consume a 1000 calorie meal in the evening to try to make up for skipping lunch.

&amp;#x200B;

Any words of wisdom here?"
keto,FIBER HELP PLEASE,So I recently started the keto diet because I have lymes disease and a pretty messed up gut. My issue right now is constipation. I want to get into a deep state of ketosis but really don't wanna go over 20 grams of carbs. I am eating like 10 to 13 grams of fiber a day with fiber supplements and kale. Any reccomendations?
keto,NSV 4 days in,I was taking ibuprofen and Tylenol every 6 hours for the last ~10 months for neck and shoulder pain. Decided to ditch it along with my keto start date just to see what happened. I have not had to take anything for pain since Sunday and I want to cry from happiness.
keto,Protein Supplement,"I am below my protein target some days.  I found a powdered protein supplement (""Protifar"") that I must have picked up at some point.  Is something like that helpful?  One scoop is only 2g of protein, that seems insignificant.  Should I use 5 scoops or something?  Even that is not that much.  It says to mix it with a cool liquid.  I tried it with water, it's gross.  Is there another cool liquid that would taste better?"
keto,Macro Ratios or Individual Targets?,"I've been doing keto for a couple weeks now.  I'm male, 54, 6'1"", and roughly 180. I'm doing medium-intensity but frequent (6 days/wk) work outs. I want to build muscle and lose belly fat. 

I've read more than a few times on here that eating fat is more about feeling full than hitting a target. So I get the impression that it's not so much the macro ratio that matters as much as calories and keeping carbs low. The keto calculator on ankerl tells me these are my targets (which represents a 15% deficit):

1807 Calories  
25 carbs  
115 Protein  
139 Fat

I've been more in the 15-20 carb range.

I'm not struggling to stay under the calories target, but I'm struggling to hit the suggested fat to protein ratio. My fat to protein ratio tends be closer to even--meaning I'm eating more protein than suggested and less fat. I thought I read somewhere that if I'm trying to burn fat this is a good thing.

I'm definitely in ketosis.

Is this ok? Or should I be trying to hit those ratios?"
keto,Keto/IF/4 low carb alcohal drinks per day?,"So I'm an alcoholic. I'm down to 4 drinks a day about 12 grams of carbs we within my plan. I only eat one meal a day at night and it's usually 0-10 grams of carbs (slow cooker meat and low carb veggie) my question is, how does the alcohal effect my weightloss? I feel thinner and the scale is going down but I here stories about how alcohal slows weightloss down? I'm thinking the IF is countering the alcohal maybe? Hoping someone could help!

Thanks!"
keto,"Simple, but Complete Explanation of Keto, Calories, and Weight Loss"," 

If you’re like me, and hang around reddit and this subreddit a lot, I’ll make this post to help you guys out. Just link people here when they ask if calories matter on keto. (Yes, the FAQ has this, but… people NEVER seem to read that)

So, keto means one thing and one thing only: To restrict net carbs, (&lt;20g, or a little more for some people), and to enter ketosis. 

Keto does NOT “guarantee weight loss”. Keto does not make you break the laws of physics, or go against the laws of thermodynamics. Calories in, calories out is what makees you lose weight.

Why keto could help you lose weight: When you are on keto, you don’t feel as hungry, because your hunger hormones aren’t as active/fluctuating. So you eat less. When you eat less, you could lose weight. 

Bottom line: Keto doesn’t guarantee weight loss. Calories in Calories Out does. If you burn more calories than you eat, you lose weight. Stop asking. Please. Keto just helps you control your hunger."
keto,Keto armpits? What's going on?,"I've noticed that my armpit has an odor recently despite the fact my hygiene is top-notch as always.

It smells like sweat, grass, and herbs combined. It's not an offensive smell but it's not nice either. 

What the heck? 

Is that some sort of low carb detoxing smell?"
keto,SV: 70 pounds down!!,"The title says it all! I've been doing keto for about 112 days (July 15), and I've gone from 352lbs to 270 as of an hour ago. 

It's been a long journey, and I still have a lot more to go! I have learned new habits, and recognized and overcame some bad ones. I have cheated (twice), felt bad about cheating (once), and kept on trucking! 

Thank you all for your support. I look forward to posting again when I hit my goal. 

Cheers everyone!"
keto,[NSV] My wedding ring doesn’t fit so well anymore,"I’ve been noticing that my wedding ring has a tendency to slip around recently. Turns out, [I can see daylight.](https://imgur.com/a/gsqzn3b) Same goes for my watch — just a tad bit looser than a month or two ago."
keto,What are your favorite ways to get your chocolate (or sweets) fix?,"I'm jumping back onto the bandwagon and I remember my biggest struggle last time was my chocolate fix.

Anyone have favorite recipes or tricks to get the chocolate fix without throwing off your whole day?"
keto,I'm tired of chasing that last meal,"Hi everyone, I feel like I just need to get this out because who knows, maybe if I can just put it down I can get it out of me and get back on track.

I started keto 2 years ago, lost 46 lbs. Was REALLY happy with myself. I had my 35th bday and then got of track and just couldn't seem to get back on the bus. It's been over a year since that bday and I have steadily crept back up. This morning I weighed myself to my immense disappointment that I am back up to only 10 lbs below what I started keto at. For the longest time, I've been telling myself that ""I just want to have one last good meal and then I'll get back on track."" I know this is classic addict behavior, always chasing that dragon for one more high. Well I finally realized what I was doing and I am ready to stop. Taking it one day at a time, changing my habits one action at a time. This morning I make a dairy free breakfast, weighed and measured everything, tracked it in my tracker, and on my way to work I didn't stop at 7/11 and get a snack live I've done for the last 3 months. I am setting a goal for myself - at the end of November, I want to be back down below a certain weight and if I do, I'm buying myself a new hoodie I've had my eyes on. Means I can't go wild at Thanksgiving but really, at 36, I've had many years going wild, maybe it's time to take it easy. 

I don't know if this helps anyone, maybe just knowing that someone out there is going through the same thing and knowing you aren't alone will help. But I know this community is very supportive, I've been lurking for too long, time to get involved."
keto,Face Gains!,"So my husband and I started doing “Dirty Keto” in January 2019. We have had our hardships and our cheat days but I’m down from 182-&gt;134 and my husband has gone from 225-&gt;180. I’m so proud of us for actually sticking to something and just getting us healthier just with our food. Now it’s time to add in the exercise!

keto,Monk fruit,"I had gestational diabetes with my 2 pregnancies, after my second one I was diagnosed with diabetes. My mom and my grandparents was diabetic. My parents in law was diabetics. I start a keto diet and I try my babies don’t eat nothing with sugar if is possible but like everybody they want cookies or cake some times. I try to cook with monk fruit but I can’t found nothing if is save for little kids ( one is a year old and the other two years old) Do you know if is good for them? Will be more easy for them if I give them healthy habits right now that they are small."

keto,Should I count calories?,Hey! I’m a 5’0 woman who’s BMR is miserably low. I want to lose weight at a good pace (2-3lbs a week) but I’m not sure if I can do that while just sticking to counting macros. Would I have to also continue counting calories to lose at the rate I want to?
keto,The biggest surprise for me on Keto...," The energy levels! At first I thought the energy levels were just going to be temporary after my first initial couple weeks, but it's been sustained. I find that I wake up alot easier, my morning cardio can be done naturally without any crap pre-workout supplements that I used to try when trying to lose weight and failed.

The second  thing I noticed is that I really don't miss the junk food with carbs that do nothing but damage to your overall health. There are plenty of tasty keto options.

To anybody out there on the edge of deciding if you should pursue this or I emplore you to try it out and see the benefits of keto for yourself! I understand keto isn't for everyone, but if you can manage to get through you'll feel amazing!

Thanks for everyone posting their success stories as well. It's extremely motivating."
keto,Holiday weight,"Been doing keto for over 5 years and normally put on a few pounds when I go away mainly from drinking to much vodka and eating lots more meats but I don’t cheat on carbs. Just got back from 2.5 weeks away and I’ve put on a stone! How can I possible put on so much weight in such a short space of time?  It wasn’t even buffers due to Covid so probably eat less than I usually would when I’m away. I’m only small build, 116 pound before i went which has been stable for over a year and now 130 pound. I’ve gone back to eating the same as I was before holiday but it’s not budging! Anyone else experienced this?"

keto,"To the ones in the zen mode thanks to keto, a question.","Hello! Hope you are all safe and healthy.

My question is to the ones who commented that they are feeling a state of zen or that thanks to keto have lost anxiety. 

I´m in that space from a few weeks now and it feels great, tbh. Previously I had anxiety the whole day and now I feel like it´s useless to control the things I can´t control. I´ve been eating keto for 8 months, mostly healthy keto, sleeping, taking my electrolytes and vitamins (vit D, Mg, triptophene, vit B6, Ca), this stuff. 

My problem now is that I can´t focus on being productive anymore. I´ve gone too zen, it´s too far. It´s so awesome not to feel anxiety yet now I see that my main motivation at work was worrying about things that might happen and now that I´m ok with everything, I´ve lost my mojo, my body is relaxed and wants to stay that way.

Do you feel or did you get to this state? If that´s the case, how did you find a balance to get some level of productivity without being anxious or stressed?"

I literally can't eat most of the food without bread.
I do cut most other carbs rice pasta fruits etc but I can't with bread especially with eggs. I tried eating without it but ended up with nausea.

-Khanum butter ghee

keto,How I lost 40lbs in 2 months," Hello everyone!

So I recently found this community and I have been sharing what has helped me to lose weight.  
In the last 2 months I have lost 40 pounds! (246 - 206)

What has really helped me is this e-book I got a while ago.

It basically has 7 tips you can implement in the moment to lose weight and how to execute them  
I  have shared it with some people in the community and they really liked  it and told me that I should make a post about it (I Hope this is isn't  against the rules)

It is completely free btw,  
HERE is a link to it - [http://jacksoncashwellness.org/WeightLoss](http://jacksoncashwellness.org/WeightLoss)

Good luck guys! Also let me know if it helps you"
keto,Here we go again,"So I have been on and off of keto for the past 3 months but this time I feel more committed than ever before lately I have been walking about 3 miles every day (or every other) which I'm sure is pretty good for me I'm 16 and 228 pounds my first goal is 180 then we will see from there I just wanted to leave this here and if everything goes well and as planned I might do progress pics 
(Side note but I am wondering about keto lunch recipes)
I'm going to go for 15 carbs or less a day and try for 1500 calories while keeping up my walking routine"
keto,OCD is making this lifestyle nearly impossible.,"The urge to track and keep my macros near perfect is making keto extremely hard for me. I wish I could just delete MyFitnessPal and do keto intuitively, because I keep feeling like such a failure.

Every time I learn something new about keto I feel like I need to redo my macros or change my approach entirely.

At first, I thought I had to eat a ton of fat, but then I learned, I already have fat! I don’t need a ton on top of it for this to work, FAT IS A LIMIT. 

Then I struggled my way to enough protein, TRY TO MEET AND EXCEED YOUR PROTEIN MACRO. 

Carbs have always been a hard limit, DONT GO OVER 20 NET CARBS A DAY. But wait, I’m having A veggie with my meal, CALCULATE THE DIETARY FIBER SO YOU DONT GO OVER ON YOUR NET CARBS. MyFitnessPal doesn’t recognize dietary fiber, so my brain gets all stressy spaghetti over my carb macro looking mega high 🥴

If I don’t track, I get anxious, and feel like all of my effort is going to waste. It makes me feel like I’m going to miss something and gain weight. 

So if someone doesn’t mind making sure I’m on the right track, I would greatly appreciate it:

CW: 205 GW:135 Height: 5’5”

keto,My subpar results compared to all the amazing ones here is kind of upsetting... Am I doing something wrong?,"I'm 165cm, CW=129lbs and SW= 138lbs. I started keto around a month ago because although I was on 900ish calories on a high carb diet, I was barely losing any weight. But keto jumpstarted my weight loss again and I could see visible results which made me so happy!! I'm not bloated, not lethargic and definitely not craving food ALL the time! 
But I have barely lost 10 pounds while so many people have been shedding 15-25(atleast on their first month). And I realise weight isn't everything, but my measurements equally have little difference from my week 2.

I keep my intake on 1000-1100 calories with an occasional 1500 calories keto cheat day(The best part about keto is I don't feel like I need more!) My macros are usually P=85-95g; F=65-70g; C=10-15g. I do a 45 minute home workout and 30 minute static cycling almost everyday. And do a little weights once or twice a week. 
I feel amazing, energized and so focused but my results are barely creditable...Am I messing up big time somewhere?"
keto,Having to give up keto sadly..,"First things first. I LOVE keto. Since I began earlier this year I've lost 30lbs. 40lbs total since starting to diet. I absolutely LOVE what this has done to my body so far.. until recently, kinda. 

I've struggled with having an upset stomach from this diet from the beginning. To begin with ""oh its keto flu"". I also struggled badly with the cramps too so I thought it wouldn't be too far wrong. A few months in ""oh I probably just ate something too fatty or too spicy"" but most recently as I have been having a worse and worse stomach I have nothing more to do other than to transition back to a normal diet before then finally if that doesn't work, contacting a doctor. I've tried to change so many things like cutting out sugar alcohols, to eating more roughage like kale in order to some how miraculously break up the fat. I've also tried to stop eating bacon and ""higher fat"" things too but nothing seems to work for very long. 

Im super sad and terrified to transition back because it took me so long and so much determination to be here and I DONT WANT to fall off the wagon and start eating poorly. I need some support to not lose my way. I am at a point right now where I've lost so much weight that if I worked out really hard, I could become toned im pretty sure. Maybe I just need to strict calorie count and work out or something (I dont work out right now). Im not sure. Im just scared and scared for my health. Mentally and physically."
keto,bought my first pair of size four jeans!,"I remember standing in line at American Eagle a few years ago and the lady in front of me was buying size zero jeans. I was buying size 18. I remember feeling ashamed and so big and uncomfortable, and trying to soothe myself, but I really just wanted to hide. At that point, I couldn't comprehend losing weight, I wasn't connected to my body at all. I couldn't imagine not being in double digit sizes. Plus size was my identity. 

During quarantine, I've gone from a 6 to a 4 (still at American Eagle) just from quitting hard liquor/cutting out drunk snacks.

keto,245 down to 190-ish for a long time.,"Hi I've been on keto for about a year and a half. Was 245 now 190. I wanted to get down to 170, but I've stopped losing weight.

keto,I need my hand held if anyone is willing.,"I'll be straight forward. If someone tells me what to do I will do it. I would appreciate not having anyone attack me or tell me some form of ""you got to want it"" I have been on keto in the past and had good results here and there but the weight always came back. I'm in a lot of pain physically and I really just need someone who feels like they have time to help another person through something like this. Someone who can keep in touch with me and help me. I'm willing to exchange phone numbers and link up an excel sheet of what I am eating for accountability but I just am so depressed, anxious and not in a good place mentally. I know that I am unable to do this on my own, and I need to start somewhere. 

Is there anyone out there who is willing to be in the diet with me so that I can do this? , and not just ""go check out this app"" or ""learn more about macros here."" F450 pounds."
keto,What is a good keto electrolyte drink without artificial sweeteners?,My fitness pal is showing that I'm not getting as many electrolytes as I should be getting and I'm convinced that artificial sweeteners are a silent plague upon us so do you have any recommendations on a electrolyte mix or a good approach?

keto,Today i feel discouraged,Hi there I'm a F 33YO 5'9 went from 250 down to 232 in 3 weeks following a calorie deficit and staying at or below 20g carbs daily. . I was so ecstatic to have lost 18lbs until I shared it with someone and their reply was you lost weight? From where? Your head? And then laughed. They never said they were joking or touched the subject again-I didn't know what else to do.. it  hurt my feelings so I kinda laughed and brushed it off too.. but today I'm looking in the mirror feeling like I don't see it either.. regretting I even said anything. I was just so excited. Now I'm just feeling hurt and anxious overthinking all the doubts about myself. I told myself I wouldn't give up this time and today I'm struggling to feel motivated and encouraged? What do you do on days where its hard? What keeps you going? What keeps you on track and determined to prove those who doubt you wrong?
keto,Walmart great value sugar free jello (contains maltodextrin) blood sugar experiment,"Sugar free jello has been a keto diet staple of mine. Its basically a daily desert for me.  I have been scared about the maltodextrin it contains. My keto levels always drop after eating pretty much anything so I wasn't sure if it was the jello or not. I decided to do a fasted experiment to determine the exact effects. This is the orange flavored sugar free jello but I don't think flavor matters that much because all the walmart sugar free jello contains maltodextrin. 

My fast was about 13 hours before the experiment. About 2 hours before the experiment, I completed 30 mins of intense cycling and a 5 mile run. Blood glucose and ketone levels were measured using a keto mojo device. I've noticed back to back tests can vary slightly but it seems relatively reliable. I ate a full box of the jello that comes out to 2 cups of jello. 

**Results**

15 mins before experiment: Blood glucose 80 Ketone: 2.2

Immediately before eating jello: Blood glucose 80 Ketone 2.2

15 mins after: blood glucose 82 Ketone 2.1

30 mins after: blood glucose 80 Ketone 2.1

45 mins after: blood glucose 78 Ketone 2.1

60 mins after: blood glucose 78 Ketone 2.1

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not an expert, but I think the walmart sugar free jello is acceptable for my keto. I love this damn jello so I'm happy that I don't need to give it up. Keto and this community has helped me a lot so hopefully this post can help someone else. I also love the skinnygirl dressings (10 cals per serving) that also contain maltodextrin so I may end up testing this in the future but I would have to pretty much drink the dressing to control the experiment and I don't really feel like doing that now. Hah"
keto,Finally made it past Halloween without stealing some candy from the kids.,Of the three years or so I've been doing Keto I finally made it past Haloween without taking a few Recees or snickers off my kids hands.  Going to try for Thanksgiving and Christmas without fail this year.
keto,Acne bc of keto?,"Normally my skin is crystal clear, I usually get one pimple every few months but other than that I have a great complexion. I’m very new to keto, it’s only been a week for me but now I’m noticing tiny pimples forming all over my forehead and it’s driving me insane. Please tell me if you’ve had similar experience and if I can treat it the same way with treating regular acne (salicylic acid, benxyl peroxide, etc)"
keto,"1 and a half weeks into keto, I didn't think I'd SEE results yet...","I'm a keto newbie, not even a full two weeks into it. Started at 190, I've lost roughly 6 pounds and I've been feeling much better. Not hungry as much, no cravings, somehow it was an easy switch. Now I know with weight loss you shouldn't take the numbers too seriously. Though the scale hasn't budged in the last 3 days, it hasn't gotten me down. I assume this is the ""healing"" process as well as the water retention from my period, though it's not discouraging in the slightest. I looked in the mirror today before my workout and realized my tank top fitted a little looser than normal. And well, the results speak for themselves.

[Progress](https://imgur.com/gallery/IAD1ywl)

I know the first says August, that's the last time I took a ""before"" pic and my weight hadn't changed since then. I wish I started keto sooner though! It's the small victories that mean the most on your journey."
keto,Accidently drank regular Coke,"I stopped by a McDonald's and asked for a Coke Zero and took a sip of it before my boyfriend (not in keto) did.  I rarely get drinks other than water because I know they aren't all good for you but he felt bad since he was the only one getting something. 
After he drank some he told me it was definitely not diet. I was just wondering if this means I'm automatically kicked out of keto 😔"
keto,Keto and Joint Health,"Hello 

I'm new to Keto. For the past year I've been on an eat whatever you want within a certain range of calories kind of thing. Even though it worked well for me in the beginning I just felt like I hit a plateau for the last few months, and I felt it's time for a change.

After doing a lot of reading, I was convinced that Keto is the way to go for me, and now I'm on my third day.

Obviously I wouldn't notice any changes in such a minimal time, but there is something that I strongly noticed. For the past several months (almost a year) I noticed my joints creaking and crackling (knees and shoulders in particular), I went to two different doctors and said it was normal and nothing is wrong, so I just tried to be extra careful with my form during exercises.

Today is the first time that I exercised since I began the Keto diet, and I was baffled. No more knee creaks during exercise, and my shoulders didn't make a single sound during push ups.

I couldn't find anything particular about improved joints performance being linked to Keto, so I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience or what is the science behind this phenomenon ?"
keto,4 months in and I'm 17 lbs away from my short term goal.,"So I went keto (and a significant calorie deficit) back in late June and was very strict about it. I was 280 lbs when I started. I now weigh 217. 

I plateaued at 227 for about 3 weeks so I took a break. Not from my diet, I continued to maintain 800 to 1200 calories a day, just a break from keto. I ate veggies that I hadn't been eating (beets, sweet potatoes, etc) because it was Thanksgiving (Canada) and I was missing those foods. Plus family dinners happened, so I may have also had a piece of pumpkin pie...

Anyway, my short term goal from the beginning was to get under 200 lbs by New Years. 7.5 weeks and 17lbs to go.

My long term goal is to get back to 170 which is what I weighed in college. From there I'll start really building muscle. So I'm back onto strict keto until then.

Anyway, something I've learned about myself is that sharing goals and plans keeps me accountable when I might otherwise slip, so I thought I'd share this with the sub. 17lbs to go!"
keto,Woke up with Acetone taste in my mouth?,"Keto diet was doing well, other than being sore mostly from my candida infection. I felt pretty good. Well week three just hit  and I woke up  with an anxiety attack, acetone taste in my mouth and my bowels which where previously  constipated evacuated like nobodies business.  

What is happening? Got a checkup about a month and a half ago and I am healthy.

I've seen several you-tube videos on acetone breath and keto. I'm so fried from my anxiety attack that I need someone to put it in layman terms. Support would be nice. I used to be obese, and last year I lost twenty pounds and now I'm just  overweight. I m trying really hard to be healthy, and I' m really sticking to my diet. Ive also been fasting. I eat at twelve and five. I eat tons of greens and healthy meats, no lunch, no sugar, no meat no msg clean keto. 

I guess I' m just nervous I'm a first timer and I'm fairly young. It would be great to get advice from some keto veterans and their journey."

keto,1st Time Posting. Exciting NSV!,"I've never created a post of my own here, but I read and read this sub for encouragement and inspiration and sometimes reply to others. I just started Week 15 of my keto journey. I began because I was feeling awful and knew I needed to get my blood sugar under control. Eating Keto has me feeling so good, and I've lost nearly 50 lbs. I had my A1C checked last Friday and just got my results: 5.3!!! That's down from 7.0 a year ago. That's no meds at all,  just significant dietary changes and weight loss. I'm absolutely over the moon. KCKO!"
keto,"Removing the Stress out of Carb Counting | Fat Adaptation | Peter Defty [Some carb sources (e.g. veggies) don't have to be counted because they are metabolised in a way that basically doesn't affect blood sugar levels. Very sensible approach, I highly recommend.]","Link to the video:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZNqRENWvmo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZNqRENWvmo)

Text from the description:

&gt;I’m going to talk about how to count carbs without going crazy.  OFM (Optimized Fat Metabolism) makes carb counting sustainable and doable for you.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;With the strictness of the Keto diet, counting every gram of carbohydrate creates stress which is actually counter-productive to what you want to achieve.    
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;So how do we count carbs in a sustainable way?   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s simple.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;You don’t. Yes, that’s correct, you can forget about counting most of the carbs you consume on a daily basis.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Firstly, we DON’T count non starchy vegetables and non starchy fruits you consume as a vegetable.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;That means you don’t have to count   
&gt;  
&gt;\- the greens you use in your salad  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Kale, mustard greens, spinach, bok choi  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Cruciferous vegetables like cabbage, brocolli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Non starchy fruits you eat like vegetables - zucchini, summer squashes, avocado, tomato,  eggplant.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;As an OFM Athlete you don’t have to stress about your root vegetables like carrots and beetroot, as long as you don’t have these in large amounts.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;So why don’t we count carbs with OFM?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Because our bodies do not work by numbers because our digestive system does not work that way.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;So if your digestive system is working fine and you are able to eat these things comfortably and enjoyably, when you take in your food, the acid in your stomach starts the breakdown process, then the bacteria, fungi and archaea in your digestive tract complete the process with little, if any, glucose transiting into the bloodstream to trigger an insulin response.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;How these carbohydrates affect your Glucose, Metabolism and Fat Adaptation  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;These carbohydrates are bound up in a matrix with fiber, fluids and minerals. What happens is these carbohydrates don’t get out right away into your stomach and small intestines, and transit your gut barrier into your bloodstream.  They end up in your colon, still bound up in this matrix of fiber, fluids and minerals.   Then the bacteria, fungi and archaea in your colon consume this food matter so virtually all of the carbohydrate actually winds up as a fatty acid and/or lipoprotein from the bacterial breakdown breakdown process.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In real world application this means you literally cannot eat enough of these vegetables to affect your blood sugar and hormone balance.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;So now that you understand how your digestive system works, you can remove the stress out of counting carbs.

keto,Halloween Slip-up,"Any one else have a slip-up during Halloween? While  unloading my kids candy haul I ended up partaking in a Reese's cup. Big mistake. That opened the flood gates. Through the course of the rest of the night, I probably had 15? more pieces of various goodies. In the midst of the binge I kept asking myself why are you doing this? My thought was that well, it's already happened. Let's get this out of our system and move on. I'm happy to report that I did. Since Halloween I haven't had anything else. I moved the candy above our kitchen cabinets. Out of sight, out of mind and you have to get a stool to get it. Trying to learn from this so I can plan accordingly for the holidays. I must say that one upside of covid is planning meals and avoiding temptations has been easier (office parties, etc.). Surprisingly I didn't feel too bad after the binge. Just woke up feeling like crap and and it about a day to feel normal again."
keto,Keto Meals - Mobile App,"I’m currently working on an undergrad project, and I’ve chosen to create an application that you can use to create meal plans for every day. I had also wanted to allow users to add takeaway keto meals where they’ve chosen to replace a prepared meal for takeaway. I’m creating the application with my target audience being people on the keto diet within the UK, and I’ve been thinking about where the best place to get nutritional values for takeaway meals would be. For McDonalds and Subway I’ve managed to find the information on this, but for other franchises I’m still looking. Could anyone provide reliable places to get this information?"
keto,How to keto on your own when you prep meals for the whole fam.,"I’ve watched people on this sub start keto at the beginning of the pandemic and lose tons of weight in just several months. I started attempting to lose weight in Jan 19 when I was around 262, got to about 238 in Oct 19, and got stuck. This seems like mostly natural weight loss and maybe some calorie restriction. By March this year I was determined to keep going to my goal of around 180, so I tried to combine IF (kinda...I can’t bring myself to let go of coffee+creamer in the AM, but usually only ate lunch and dinner) and realistically only lost like 8ish pounds from March to July (I went from bouncing between 242-238 at my highest, to bouncing between 231-225). I’m kind of frustrated with my progress and I can only hope to not gain everything back by spring.

I really want to try keto, but I am worried about keto flu (really bad time to have flu-like symptoms), and I also prep meals for my whole family (my 6 year old is quite finicky). I’m also a carb fiend, being Italian/Mexican, so everything I like is pizza, pasta, bread, or tortillas...or cereal...or cravings for sweet anything...I feel doomed...

How do members of households do keto and also feed everyone else who might not be doing keto or won’t touch keto foods or can’t digest cruciferous veggies? (Everything seems to be made of cauliflower!!!)

Thanks in advance."
keto,"Pretty slow progress throughout 2020, could use advice","So I’ll start by saying I’ve been doing keto for 2.5 years and had pretty good progress until about February of this year. I don’t know what changed but my weight kept going up and down with no real progress. I’ve tried changing what I eat, eating less / intermittent fasting and I started working out last month but the weight still hasn’t dropped and just hovers around the same weight. 

I don’t know if less calories is the right answer, or changing what I eat but I’m open to suggestions. Fwiw, I have a feeling I need to change my macros / calorie count since I’ve been using the same numbers since I started but I also feel like I’m starving myself with less calories (I could definitely be better about eating vegetables though).

keto,Triathlete,"Hi all, good morning and good night for some.

I am extremely new here, and as the flair states, I'm looking for help. I took a break from triathlon for awhile and therefore have gained 25lbs. I still look slim, and I do stand at 6ft 2in. I am 200lbs overall. I want so desperately to get back to my race weight of 175lbs. I've been training for a month overall now, and I'm even starting a sports club here in my home for people to get involved.

Just a little back ground there. I want to know how keto works and if I am still able to drink beer! Haha. Overall I am serious about this weight loss. Where do I begin ? 


Thank you all in advance. I'll even post progress pictures."
keto,[SV] 3 weeks in,"I've been doing this for 3 weeks now, not counting calories, only latently counting carbs in my head but not really tracking. Little to no exercise (which I want to improve in time). Allowing myself plenty of slack (erythrit in my coffee, eating fast food after removing most of the carb sources in it, nothing that nearly fulfills any measure of perfectionism). I have so far lost more than 10 lbs (safe to say 5 kg are gone, hopefully forever). I'm deeply depressed, grieving and find it hard to celebrate anything but I wanted to write this down and share it with you so that it feels real and I begin to learn to appreciate it, even if not right now. 

The biggest challenge for me has been in convincing myself that I need to lose weight, which I succeeded in after a bout of severe back pain, only with the side effect of losing my ability to look into the mirror and think ""she's fine"". I now have the ""fungus"" of feeling fat back in my brain. I intend to treat it with caution and not let it get comfortable in there, but for now it's helping me stick to keto.

keto,Colitis and keto,"Has anyone else experienced flares of colitis while doing low carb diets?  I’ve been doing low carb diets for over a decade starting with Atkins to primal and keto and have noticed over the last five years that I tend to have UC type symptoms several times a year including blood in stool and episcleritis in one or both eyes. 

The obvious answer is to see a doctor and I have had a colonoscopy where the result was just “You have a little inflammation there. Take more fiber”. 

Has anyone else had or currently have a similar experience?  Have you modified your diet in some way that has helped?  Most articles state to keep a food journal and that everyone reacts differently but some general help or starting tips would be appreciated by the community. 

I want to continue with the dieting and working out but not if it is harming me or even potentially shortening my lifespan (possibly melodramatic). 

Thanks"
keto,Joint pain/stiffness?,"Hi, I'm 30F/167 and I used to be active here back in 2014-ish, but I haven't done keto in a while. I'd gotten more lax on carbs over the past few years but seemed to stave off weight by increasing my exercise level instead. That being said, even though I'm pretty comfortable with my weight now, I've gotten into craft beers, and like many of us in corona times, have also started choosing more ""easy"" foods like pastas and breads again. 

Just last week, even with the change in temperature and things getting cold suddenly (Pennsylvanian here), I began waking up with stiff joints in my knees and fingers especially. My wrists were killing me depending on the time of day. My mom developed osteoarthritis a few years ago and was able to reverse it completely by overhauling her diet and losing 130 pounds... How many have you have ever seen a drastic reduction in joint  pain and swelling on keto? I guess because I hit 30 I'm starting to understand more about using a diet to control your overall health as opposed to just controlling your weight. I'm curious to hear any success stories and I'm thinking that it's best to get back on and see if it clears up!"

keto,Not having cravings already feels like a victory,"I started keto very recently and i'm not completely sure if it's a placebo effect or if the diet in its all honesty is working so well. I bought a pack of berries in case I get an awful sweet cravings but nope! I guess I could eat them with greek yogurt but overall craving for dessert or little snacks is gone. Just a cup of tea is enough to satisfy the need for something extra.

It's honestly such a weird feeling. This makes me feel so hopeful for the future."
keto,Keto hangovers are real.,"I slipped a bit this weekend and had a beer, half a bottle of cava and two gin and tonics and the hangover from hell. Normally I’d be fine after that, a bit headachey at most. But I felt like I had a bottle of gin. I couldn’t stop throwing up, my head was banging, I was exhausted. 

The keto hangovers are real. Defs wasn’t worth it."
keto,Can chia seeds kick me out of ketosis?,"I know they shouldn't but...

I usually finish my (one a day) keto meal with a couple of tablespoons of ground flaxseeds in a warm water. It works well against constipation.

Then I decided to try chia seeds instead. I have been doing it for a week. The carb content should be negligible; however, I have started developing massive carb cravings soon after drinking the water with chia seeds and they tend to last for the whole day.

Nothing else has changed with my diet. What could it be? Is it possible that the chia seeds elicit an insulin spike?"
keto,BC and appetite,"I went on oral combination pill couple months ago. Ever since I seem to have lost the usual strength to say no to food and every drop of discipline I've had. I've ballooned up by gaining 4 kg in a month. I am so sad. Paragard keeps falling out of my uterus and I can't see my doctor for awhile.

It was do easy to say no to food and eat withing my macro/calorie goals. Now I want to eat anything at any time and never feel full 

Were you able to stay keto and successfully lose weight after starting BC pills that made you hungrier? How did you solve this type of problem? Any advice would be helpful."
keto,keto 6 weeks challenge,2 years back there was a 6 weekly keto challenge and i joined it and it helped me staying on track and losing alot of lbs. I am looking forward to it.

keto,Help? I hate almond flour.,"Almost all recipes i’ve found and tried have almond flour in them, and I kind of hate it. It absorbs almost all the liquid in the recipe and the little almond pieces get so bloated and a lot bigger than when they started. It’s almost like I’ve cooked with almond meal.

keto,Carb cycling... help,"So I became interested in lower carb/keto eating. For a month I lowered my carbs to about 35-40 net carbs a day (previously 120-130). I know that was probably not enough for ketosis, but I wanted to get into it gradually and I didn’t really know much about the diet at that point. For the next month And a half I kept my carbs to 20 net carbs a day. Sometimes lower sometimes slightly higher. I was interested in the diet for his anti-inflammatory effects, potential hormone balancing affects and weight loss. I’m not overweight but I don’t feel good in my body. I had a major surgery and had to be Inactive for almost 4 months. Prior to this I was a competitive marathoner running 90 miles a week. I’m a 26-year-old female who now weighs 129 pounds (5’3). My comfortable weight is 115-118. Eating the lower carb way I lost maybe 3 to 5 pounds... all in the first 2-3 weeks really. 

After consideration of lifestyle and sustainability I was curious about carb cycling. Especially with the amount of training I do.  Throughout these months I was eating ~1700 cal average and doing 1 hr 40-2 hours of cardio (cycling, elliptical, alter g treadmill running) a day, as well as strength training 2-3x a week. The scale really wasn’t budging at all After the first 3 weeks. If I’m not getting the weight loss benefits this really isn’t worth it to me- I don’t really enjoy the diet much anyways and would like something more flexible  ... so being very frustrated I had a day where I had a few servings of carbs.. the next day I shot up 4 pounds!! I thought it would come off after a week of eating super clean and low carb, but it’s still there and def. got  worse while eating better all week...literally too scared to weigh myself now. Why didn’t it go down during the week of going back to low carb?! Why did it get WORSE? My stomach was soo puffed out and retaining so much water all over. I decided again today to add in a few Healthy carb sources because why not at this point (did NOT add calories, just replaced some fats with carbs) ... I look pregnant and my clothes fit tighter. I’m so sad I want to cry. Did I really dig myself into This much of a hole after 2.5 months (and not even all keto during this time?!). I’m so frustrated. I wanted to try carb cycling but have no idea what to do. I feel like my body hates me. It’s not working right and it won’t lose weight despite all of my training and heathy eating. This calorie intake would have previously resulted steady weight loss but now it doesn’t. If you made it this far... thank you. Please offer any advice. I just want to feel good again. I really hate how I look and feel."
keto,Stalled with Keto,"Hi!  I’ve been keto for 9 months - I have been stalled (no weight loss) for months.  I haven’t gained just stalled- I appreciate any words of advice.  I eat 20met carbs a day and check my ketones (blood) and I’m in moderate to high ketosis.  
Thank you for your help!"
keto,Can you enter ketosis without a proper plan?,"For example I can eat whatever food I want as long as it meets the keto standards, for instance this week I feel like going heavy on the weight loss so I will go heavy on the calorie deficit but the next one I'm not feeling it so much so I will go light on the calorie deficit, is that fine? Been lurking around this sub for a while and I've gotten the idea that this diet is extremely strict and one small mistake will have so many consequences. Would appreciate a response, Thanks in advance."
keto,Am I doing it right,Just wondering if numbers ok 15 net carbs 103 fat 169 protein 1439 calories  not hungry  is that ok or am I doing it wrong 3rd day. Want to lose weight and hopefully improve diabetes. If wrong place to ask sorry thanks for any help.
keto,More fiber?,Hi all! I’ve been ordering keto bread on Amazon lately but it’s been getting pretty expensive. There’s no keto bread or keto pasta at my local grocery store. Now here’s the big question: is there some sort of fiber I can eat with my typical bread or pasta to make it less net carbs? Thanks in advanced! Best answer gets an award! :)
keto,how do I love keto? let me count the ways (a week 3 update),"my anxiety is non-existent.

my moods are transformed (more mellow, more optimistic)

I had enough energy to clean my house on a day off when I would normally just want to catch up on sleep.

I don't feel overwhelmed and fatigued at the thought of doing things outside my house.

my energy level is unrelated to when I ate.

my energy level is higher.

my stress level is unrelated to when I ate or what I ate.

my stress level is lower.

my sleep is unrelated to when I ate or what I ate.

my sleep is sounder.

my extra fat is being used for much more useful things than just sitting around on the back of my thighs collecting dust.

I love keto, and I think it loves me back 😍

do you love keto?"
keto,My vital notes on Keto," This might help somone somewhere..I started Keto earlier this year and I had learnt alot about my body. Thanks to God. People usually talk about how amazing they felt in Keto but for me it was a journey of taking notes.. Within the first few days I started feeling amazing, my mental well being was amazing , I had a lot of enrgy and overally it seemed working.. Within a week I crushed to severe fatigue and general lethergy.. this stayed with for long as I could not pin point what the f* was going.. I tried to to up my electrollytes but it dint work ... I decided to just continue with it and my progress was nil.. though I decided to power through how ever shitty I felt.. after some weeks I again started feeling amazing, my energy was through the roof( I could wake up in the middle of the night ready to hit the gym) , my sleep felt amazing, my focus,memory, cognition was at all time high ( I remember finishing my assignmnets in a couple of hours.. those assignments used to take days in my pre keto days  ...I am an engineering student who really needed that boost) .. my mood was amazing and generally felt like a superman in every way... Shortly after that I crushed badly to severe fatigue, sleep apnea, mental fog and the list is long... I was losing morale in Keto coz it never seemed to last like always I was crushing after any high I felt... After that I decided to focus on my elctrolytes.. here came the mystry.. whenever I upped my electrolytes I would get these range of awful symptoms..list them.. I would increase my salt intake and will feel like my heartbeat is getting out of control, I will increase my potassium and I will feel the immediate fall of my blood pressure.. I will increase my Magnesium and here I come feeling no diffrence.. I felt really bad about whatever Keto was doing in my body.. just quit this shit and go back to your ordinary life was the constant urge I had to always fight.. my body was protesting against the diet but I never gave in ... after that I realized something about Potassium that changed the story.. I upped my poatssium regardless of how I immediately felt and the switches in my body connected ! .. I started feeling good again( though not that good) slowly I regained my wellbeing.. Big note in the journey was “electrolytes”... Actually without good balance of electrolytes in your body there is no need for high ketones or whatever.. imagine electrolytes been the connection and ketones been the fuel.. your car will never start if the connections are not working even if the tank is f* full to the brim... and your body knows how to tell you what is going by sending you awful messages of tiredness, lethergy, sleep apnea, digestive issues, mental fog,dizziness, mention them... 
yeah It was a looooog journey but very eduacative one... After that I got hooked in biology and how our bodies work and I think now  I have a hardly earned degree of biology from the university of internet and trial and errors...."
keto,This is where I always mess up... attempting to change that this time,"Hello everyone, 

I am M/5'11'/245 19 year old.  I really do enjoy keto, as I have had some success in the past (when i was 17 i lost about 30 pounds \~269-235ish\~), but I just have a hard time sticking to a diet and staying motivated.  I am not happy about where I'm at with my weight and body comp, and I think a big issue is I almost don't believe that I can lose like 50 pounds and be at a healthy bmi and enjoy how I look.  I think this is because I have always been pretty overweight for my size, as well compared to my friends.  

&amp;#x200B;

I am athetic, and try to exercise when I can but my schoolwork keeps me busy.  I just wanted to hear some ways that anyone here took a good approach to the long term plan and were able to stick to keto for a decent amound of time.  I want to lose this weight, I just end up slipping up after 2-3 weeks every time I feel like.  It really frustrates me that I cannot stick to this for many months, as I find I truly do feel much better when I am eating healthy.  And when I do mess up, I end up just following every craving I have and eating fast food way too much.  

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions, advice, motivation, or criticism is very apprecitated.  I want to make this happen, and I have the means to, I just almost don't believe that it will happen, or that it can happen because I have never known myself not being overweight.  Thanks to anyone who reads this, responds to it, or just thanks to this subreddit for being something that is challenging me.  Have a good one everyone, stay away from that sugasugar 

&amp;#x200B;

Take care, 

Your friendly diet-struggler"
keto,Reactive Hypoglycemia Mea Culpa,"So, my previous post regarding possible reactive hypoglycemia was flagged by moderators as being ""cheat oriented"" and ""defeatist"". Sorry if I triggered anyone. I have found this subreddit extremely helpful as I attempt to adapt and maintain a ketogenic diet for weight loss and health benefits. I was merely asking for help after encountering rather unpleasant side effects. Thanks to other keto Redditors, I have a good idea of what to ask my doctor next time I have an appointment. 

While I appreciate the moderator's efforts to keep this subreddit a positive and supportive forum, I would caution against censoring posts that highlight the difficulty of adapting to and maintaining a restrictive dietary regime. The keto lifestyle, especially in the context of standard American/Western food culture, is difficult and to pretend otherwise is an outright falsehood. 

Let's try and keep this forum civil and open to discussion on a myriad array of relevant topics instead of censoring and shaming each other. We are here with a common goal: to help ourselves and others as we use a keto diet to lose weight and improve our health."
keto,Smaller waist for guys after a month or two?,"I've been on the keto diet for close to a month. I've lost around 9-10 pounds, but my waist is the same size.
I see a lot of people post how much weight they've lost, but with exercise I don't think weight loss is always the best judge of how it's working for men.
Any guys track their waist size over time while on the diet?
At my thinnest, my waist was around ten inches smaller. I don't know if I'd look healthy that small again, but 4-8 inches is a good goal for me, I think.
Just curious about timelines..."
keto,I’m pretty new here.,"My good friend told me I should be here. 
He said there’s a space for my story amongst the rest. 
So I’m here to see if anything I have to say or have been through, resonates. 

I started strict, clean keto last summer. 
Since that day, I’ve shed 174 pounds. 
I’m posting my story in f/intermittent fasting too as I’ve done this work with a daily 23:1. 
Thanks for being here friends."
keto,Week 2 of keto,"Hey guys, so I started keto 2 weeks ago. The first week was fantastic. I can already feel the results. My clothes feel less tight, I have more energy, my hunger is down. Going onto week two I have noticed that I have a small headache every day. And sometimes feel light headed and dizzy. I’ve also noticed that I am struggling to stay hydrated. I drink about 5-6 bottles of my flask (32oz) and it seems like if I stop i immediately become dehydrated. I’ve read some posts on here and think it could possibly be an electrolyte issue? I know I’m eating enough, and when I chug my 32oz of water the symptoms go away for a little bit. Any advice? Thank you much appreciated"
keto,Reactive Hypoglycemia,"I've been on strict keto for a little over 3 month. Last night, I indulged in a little Halloween candy. Within a few hours, I had an extreme headache, nausea, and weakness. I am not diabetic but symptoms and timing are consistent with reactive hypoglycemia. My question is, does ketogenic dieting predispose otherwise healthy people to reactive hypoglycemia following bulk sugar/carbohydrate consumption? I cannot find any scientific studies that address this topic. Any anecdotal experiences with this scenario would be greatly appreciated."
keto,Back at it - 115lbs down,"I've done a full year of Keto in 2017 and lost 150lbs in that time. I then fell off the wagon for a good while and gained 50lbs back in 2 years. A few weeks ago I told myself - enough. I am back on the keto train and am feeling great. I am doing daily excercise, be it a walk around the neighborhood or weight lifting training, or youtube cardio videos. 

&amp;#x200B;

Keto has been a blessing for me. It's fairly straight-forward for me. Are there things I miss - for sure, but I also recognize my relationship to food has changed a bit. Being mor conscious about what and how much I eat is strangely empowering to me. I am glad to be back and a part of this community. It seems like there was a time where this community was a bit more stand-offish, but I am happy to see this sub being back to its supportive spirit. Good job, y'all. You're taking control of your life, and each one of you is killing it!"
keto,New vitamins not sure if it's keto approved,"So I bought these vitamins not too long ago and noticed that it's a whole food multivitamin. It contains things that I normally wouldn't ingest on keto. To name a few potato starch, apples and manganese from brown rice chelate. Tried to attach a picture with this post but I guess there isn't an option for it. The name of the vitamin is Vitamin code women - whole food multi vitamin. I just really want to know if it's okay to take on the keto diet"
keto,Dating after significant weight loss...,"Has anyone here encountered anxiety and even depression when trying to get back into the dating game after significant weight loss? I’ve lost 222lbs so far, from 490 to 268. My weight was never this low in my adult life and now that it is, and I’m feeling and looking better, I’m starting to receive attention from people and I’m honestly not sure how to handle it. I’ve never truly received it before lol. I haven’t even dated anyone at all in over 10 years. Once I reached 400lbs, I stopped looking because I couldn’t imagine anyone being genuinely interested in someone who was as big and obviously irresponsible as I was, and I guess after 10 years of internalizing that mindset, I’m finding it hard to break now. It’s like my embarrassment over my weight before has now been replaced by an embarrassment over my excess skin. In many ways, it’s even worse because I feel like I’ve worked so hard to lose this weight only to be rewarded with a body that looks like a melting candle. I just can’t imagine any normal person feeling sexually attracted to me looking like this. I really want to overcome this because I’ve never felt better in my entire life, and I want so badly to find someone to grow with me, and “build a sweet little nest, somewhere in the west, and let the rest of the world go by” as the old song goes lol...but that feels more far off and unobtainable than the 223 lost pounds felt when I was 490. I feel like my situation is made worse by the fact that I am a gay man who considers himself mildly conservative, so it’s sets me apart from most of the group already lol.  

Perhaps I’m just being too defeatist, I don’t know. Maybe later I’ll regret writing this post, but in this moment, I’d really like to know if there is anyone else out there has come so far, only to feel just as isolated and cast out as they felt before?"
keto,Sugar alcohol question (vomiting/diarrhea),"Hello all, been on the keto diet off and on for over a year, currently 3 months on, and absolutely in love with everything it does for me and dropping about 10lbs a month.

A few months ago, when I was still relying on Atkins treats to satisfy sugar cravings, I had one terrible night. After eating 2-3 chocolates (each one serving) I was in the bathroom exploding out of both ends at the same time. Afterwards I still felt sickly for about 2 days but no more episodes like that.  When I searched online I found plenty about diarrhea as a side effect (which I was aware of) but nothing about vomiting along with it. 

I'm just curious if that was from the sugar alcohols or if it was maybe food poisoning. These days I just use Swerve and it agrees with me very well.

Sorry to ask kind of a gross question. I think it might foster a helpful discussion for people just starting the diet and searching for ways to satisfy their sweet tooth."
keto,Okay. Back at it after a couple rough weeks.,"Backstory: I (33F) always been “the fat kid.” Diagnosed with Type II diabetes at 16, but never really did anything about it. Delusional about diet and exercise.  I’ve always been a go-getter, do all the things, never take care of myself kind of person. I finally got fed up of being sore and tired, and even though I did all the things, have chronic fatigue and pain. Boyfriend and I started keto in January for 2.5 months...didn’t lose any weight. (I don’t think we were eating enough fat...) and then when quarantine, Covid, riots, happened, I totally just fell off bandwagon and did whatever to soothe the emotional rollercoaster. I did not lose or gain any weight in the next 6 months...but I definitely feel weaker and “fluffier” than before. 


Current: I started keto again 6 weeks ago. 
I had been going #ketostrong for 4 weeks...and I derailed the week I managed to dislocate my collarbone, have terrible PMS, and have a kidney infection all within the same 10 days. Currently, I am feeling much better, and spent today [meal prepping ](https://ibb.co/pfpnSfb) for the week ahead. Working on preparing myself mentally for the week(s) ahead. 

—Italian sausage egg bake 
—Cheddar brat with veggies
—(not in picture)Baked chicken for salads
—Keto almond w/cream cheese frosting cookies
—Keto PB cookies 

I’ve seen how positive this community is on posts and I am grateful for each and everyone I see. Keeps me inspired to keep going. 

TLDR; meal prepped today after a couple rough weeks. Feeling good to get back at it."
keto,"What does it mean to be ""fat adapted"" ?","I'm trying to pin this down. Does being fat adapted simply mean that, if you begin to consume a higher amount of carbs/sugar again, that your body will more easily target fat once those fuels are burned off, provided that you don't consistently keep eating a ton of sugars and carbs? Does it mean you can easier slip into ketosis? I am trying to think of what my life might look like once I hit my target weight. I am thinking to keep to keto 5 days a week and then on the weekends allow my carb intake to be higher if  I am going to be doing things socially."
keto,I thought that being fit was impossible for me and that some people are just born lucky,"M/22/5'9"" \[205lbs &gt; 163lbs = 42lbs\] (2,5 years) 

I was struggling with my weight for a long time because of bad eating habits, nights out and other things. Tried going vegetarian but that didn't last long because I can't quit eating meat. But I instantly saw results once I started combining the keto diet with IF. I restricted my carb intake to under 30g a day and ate a lot of eggs, bratwurst, nuts, low carb vegetables and cevapcici (eat it, it's one of the best things ever made). [Here are some progress pics of mine](https://imgur.com/a/RRTuCwc)

keto,Keto not working for me?!,"Hello! I am F,33, 5’5 and 145lbs. I have done dirty keto in the past for maintenance and have been doing the clean keto since a month now and not lost an inch! I also incorporated 20:4 for first week and now doing OMAD. I eat chicken, low carb vegetables, cheese, eggs and nuts mostly for dinners. I don’t follow any macros but keep carbs under 20gm. Occasionally berries and Quest Bars and dark chocolate. Low carb alcoholic beverages on weekends. Take my electrolytes daily and I add MCT oil to my coffee with my dinner. I don’t workout and have a sedentary job. I am very disappointed and frustrated and not sure what am I doing wrong? Any help or suggestions please?! I am starting to believe may be Keto is not for me and should do low calorie diet?"
keto,Keto for a Month Feels Great!,"[My progress.](https://i.imgur.com/IRMg5Ah.jpg)

Thought I’d share, going on keto has been amazing...I know some people have much bigger gains, but losing 10lbs just by dieting was something I didn’t think was possible. Also my indigestion and bloating is pretty much non existent, seems like all that was caused by carbs. 

I didn’t even crave candy yesterday, despite being a huge candy person pre keto. 

Looking forward to keto thanksgiving :)"
keto,"I want to add more fish to my diet, any good salmon recipes?","I don't eat much fish at all. Just package tuna, occasionally sardines and catfish. I do eat shrimp a few times a month though. I do make cod once in a while and it turns out okay. I'm really not that big on fish flavors. I just don't like it.. but I know it's important to get a lot of fish. I'm going to start buying Salmon, but years ago when I tried it in a few recipes, idk if I just don't like Salmon or the recipes sucked but I hated them. So I'm a bit anxious about just picking something random off of Google. 

Anyone have any good Salmon recipes that aren't too much that someone who doesn't like fish that much can handle? Know this sounds picky but would love some help here and any is appreciated."
keto,Question - daily carbs and fiber count,"I’ve been doing my best to keep my net carbs low. But I’m curious how to keep my fiber up at the same time. I have lists of low carb/high fiber foods to choose from. But I’d like to get a feel for how much fiber intake is normal on a keto diet. Most health authorities recommend 25-40ish grams of fiber. But how can I manage that, and also keeps my net carbs super low?  I try to stay away from processed food. So I’m relying on basic natural foods for this. Chia seeds, spinach, eggplant, pinto beans...etc can get pretty repetitive after a while. Anyway, does anybody mind sharing what their daily fiber intake is? And if your supplementing with a bulk fiber."
keto,Keto recommended to me for my psychosis - help?,"So I have psychosis and a cousin who is a psychiatrist says that the leading ""cure"" for mental health difficulties is a ketogenic diet for reduction of inflammation.

Sushi, fried rice etc I'm gonna miss so much and I'm wondering how I can help that because I really love rice lol"
keto,Friend's on Keto; Choosing a Restaurant,"Hi all!  A friend of mine has been on keto for a while now, and I've invited her out to a restaurant w/a small group of folks for my bday.  I'd like to be mindful of her food restrictions.  I'm currently narrowing down the list of the places I'd like to go, and I'm just wondering if anybody can provide me quick bullets on what foods are off limits for keto.  I'd reach out to her, but I don't wanna shine a spotlight or anything.  I've done some Googling, but it's all over the place.  Thanks!"
keto,Net carbs question,"Hi,

I saw some ""keto-friendly"" cupcakes today in the store. In big, bold print on the front they said 5 net carbs. But then, I look at the label and they have 33g carbs and 5g fiber. Now, I admit I'm not great at math, but I know 33-5 ain't 5.

Does anyone know how they can claim 5 net carbs?"
keto,Weigh-in,"I've been doing Keto since August 30th. I initially started because I had to buckle down and start studying for the bar properly, and with lots of wine and being a sedentary stoner loser, I had a buttload of inflammation symptoms - migraines, nausea. Anyway, 2 months in, I just weighed myself and was really disappointed, because I had only lost 22lbs. I started at 224lbs, 5'6, 26F. I naturally have a significant amount of muscle mass, as well, because despite being a weirdo stoner loser, I always really enjoyed lifting weights (which I had to stop doing around August because of unstable joints), Long story short, I've been kind of upset all day, telling myself all of these defeatist things, like: everyone is losing weight so much faster, there's no point, I should just quit and all that bull anus. But then, I went to my 'why I started' manifesto, and I thought about all the things I've gained from Keto. Waking up not feeling like butt, the loss of inflammation, increased energy, no migraines and cluster headaches. Etc. Because I decided to do something good for my body, I didnt even start because I wanted to lose weight, (which, duh. 22lbs, with no exercise? freaking awesome, girl, stop being a baby) And above all, I am much better prepared for exams, it motivated me to change several aspects of my life. I mean, I am still a sedentary weirdo stoner loser, but only at certain hours of the day."
keto,"Have lost 65 lbs in the last 3-4 months, man boobs will not shrink.","Over the summer, I stepped on the scale for the first time in about a year, and it read exactly 300.0 lbs. I knew it was time to lose weight before I've gone too far, and since then I've been strictly keto with only one small anniversary vacation break. I am down to 235lbs, and I gotta say I feel great. Better than I ever have. One of my biggest insecurities has always been my man boobs. Proportionally speaking, my chest has always been more distracting than my stomach, and I had hoped that losing weight would get me down in all areas. I can see the tendons in my hands, and finally feel my ribcage, but my man boobs haven't shrunk at all. Now that I look thinner, and my noobs haven't gotten smaller, I am increasingly even more self conscious because now I have *tits*. I am calling my doctor tomorrow to get my blood and hormones checked out because I literally don't know any guy who isn't over 400lbs with a larger chest than me. It's super distracting and makes me feel like less of a man. Is it worth using a binder or some sort of material to lessen the visual aspect? Does anyone else have a similar experience to me? I feel pretty alone in this problem, and could use any advice given. 
Thank you for reading and for your time.

keto,Coming from carnivore,"Hey guys, I’m coming over from carnivore to switch it up a little. I’ve been carnivore for 9 months and lost 50lbs. But of late have hit a wall. For the past two days I’ve been eating 4-5 bacons with 5 fried eggs, 1/2 ground beef and 3 cups of broccoli and sugar free jello if I’m still hungry.. my macros are set pretty good with protein around 160 and fat 195. Basically my question is will I be ok eating three to 4 cups of broccoli as my veggie? Or do i need more leafy greens? I’ve survived this long on carnivore just eating meat so I don’t even know if I need veggies lol?? Also I eat beef liver for Vitamins 2-3x a week."
keto,I thought I’d share my thinking and (I believe) my simple way of controlling weight,"TLDR; eat less sugar, fast everyday. Enjoy everything else. 

Keto stand for Ketones. But what are they? It’s easier to think of their opposite, insulin. Insulin is used to reduce sugar levels in our blood. It does this by ‘storing’ surplus sugars in ‘fat’ cells. So if Ketones are the opposite does that mean they take sugar from ‘fat’ cells? Yes! 
Ketones are what I’m looking for my body to produce. But how would one produce them? Let’s start with the opposite again, insulin is produced when your body identifies your blood sugar level spike (high). Ketones produce when blood sugar level is low. 
So eat lots, produce insulin and ‘store’ fat. 
Eat less, produce ketones and ‘use’ fat. 
So what do I do? Intermittent fasting (minimum 12 hour fasting window per day). A guaranteed way of producing ketones. If you don’t eat (or drink anything sugary) your blood sugar level will drop. 
When I’m not in my fasting window I try to avoid high sugar sources. 
I don’t care about carbs, fat, saturated fat, etc. I just try to control sugar intake. 
Is my diet strict? No. I eat take out, drink alcohol, snack, and love butter. 
What do I try to avoid? Bread, sweets (candies), energy drinks, soft drinks, and too much fruit. 
I’m stronger and leaner than ever and my exercise, on average, is about 3 times a week. 

This turned into a bigger post than I was expecting. I wanted to show that controlling weight is easy. It just takes a small amount of discipline. Happy to answer questions :)"
keto,How to Stay with Keto Lifestyle Minus a Gallbladder,I posted this in keto foods sub but I am trying to figure out how to handle doing keto which is heavy on fat use when I don’t have a gallbladder.

keto,"Talk to me about maintenance. Once you’ve hit your goal weight, what changes did you make in your diet? Adding back some carbs? Fruit? No changes? How do you keep the weight off but not continue losing?","I’ve heard that some people add fruit back in or less bad carbs like sweet potatoes and brown rice.

keto,Hemp and Coconut protein,"So,guys,I tried Coconut protein,its fine for keto bread,but saw in Store hemp protein ,that has like 6g carbs on 100g,while Coconut protein has 23.What confused me is why then everybody use almond fluor that has far more carbs then both of this things?What I am missing?"

I was concerned I wasn’t losing weight and realized I fell out of ketosis somehow, so for the past 4 days I’ve been weighing everything, counting every calorie ,  for the past 3 days it’s been negative which explains why weight loss has been so hard. 

What am I doing wrong ? Nothing has changed , from the beginning I was losing was definitely in ketosis 

Any ideas or a different perspective would be great."
keto,Just had grass fed (and grass finished) steak. I'm almost crying of good it felt.,"Never was the type of eating steak because of my household, but had it for lunch after fasting period.

keto,I lost 100lbs and now I don't know if I was sexually harassed or if I don't know what normal is.,"So my husband and I stopped at a friend's house last night who we hadn't seen in years. I've lost about 100lbs since the last time I saw him. There were a couple other people there whom my husband was chatting with also, and on numerous occasions in front of my husband and also alone this old buddy kept going on about how much weight I've lost and how good I look. Being a large person all my life, I feel like men don't typically just put their hands on you because they have no desire to, perhaps. Well, much of the evening, and very different from any behavior he's ever previously displayed, he kept placing his hand on my arm or the small of my back, briefly. Nothing too odd but still made me slightly uncomfortable. However, a little later on the evening, he walked up behind me and said something about how happy he was we came and wrapped his arms around my body, and his arms and hands were half on and under my breasts and he was squeezing me very tight for a while and I was shocked. On one hand this seems like totally normal behavior that I see people doing. On the other, this is completely abnormal for me, and I felt like I was constantly trying to avoid his touches any time he started talking to me, and like he finally ""got me"" when I wasn't looking. I'm just confused if this truly is normal behavior that I'm blowing out of proportion because I'm the one who doesn't know what regular human interactions are like because I've always been the fat girl people avoided, or was this dude out of line?"

keto,Intermittent Fasting and Keto,"I just finished a 36-hour fast and was unsure about something...

I read somewhere here that you can only use up to 22kcals of fat for energy, if I only have around 20lbs fat. Does that mean I burn approximately 440 calories from fat during that fast? Is the rest muscle?

keto,Is that Parosmia? or keto ruined my sense of smell and taste???,"I lost my smell and taste in March because of COVID, but after that my sense became normal, then in September, I started keto diet.

keto,How much fat should you eat for weight loss on IF 20:4?,"Hey all.

As the title says, how much fat should one eat when fasting 20:4 for weight loss? The keto calculator says 100gr per day for me, but is this still necessary when trying to lose body fat?

 I try to get in my daily protein goal, but I was curious if it's still necessary to eat high fat at the same time as trying to lose fat?

I dont want to make hard work undone by eating too much fat. Or is this not a problem on keto?

Any experiences?

Thanks!"

keto,Cheats,"I've been doing keto for about 2 months now. I decided to have a brownie, not sure why. I knew I'd feel like crap afterwards but it was a pot brownie, and a gift. I'm going to eat as planned for the rest of the day and just continue like it never happened. I'm obviously gonna gave keto migraines again this week, but I'm also doing alternate day fasting so that's gonna be tough. I think ill try to eat as much fat as I can, and cut carbs doing to less than 10, for the week. Ugh, why did I eat it. I could've thrown it away. 

But no. Indulging was a stupid idea, particularly because I'm so sensitive to inflammation and the effects of breaking in such a sugary way, will be devastating, but I'm a human being, I'm not going to hate myself for doing something silly."

keto,Virgils zero sugar root beer,"So this stuff is much better than Zevia root beer in my opinion, it’s perfectly carbonated and isn’t harsh on the throat. The flavor is also superior.

Now please stay on track because I’m not asking you to tell me to love myself as I am or to just go harder in the gym. I WORK OUT DAILY. I’ve had loose skin for 10+ years and a gym cannot change your body shape completely. 

NOW to the question. Has anyone continued a keto diet while preparing for surgery and during recovery? I’m starting to take supplements to help my blood levels overall, but I’m noticing that pre-op drinks (like Ensure Presurgery) and post-op supplements (like Juven) are specifically marketed as being high in carbohydrates to help you prepare and recover. Why would you need high carbs for this?

The main issue with PS recovery is swelling, accumulating fluids, bruising, etc. My personal experience with eating more carbs would be blowing up like a balloon from water retention as well as feeling very bloated with brain fog. Am I misunderstanding why significantly increasing carbs actually *would* be beneficial here?

Yes, I’m going to ask my doctor closer to surgery. Just thought I’d see what you guys thought and see if there’s anyone who’s gone through this already."
keto,5 benefits of eating chocolate every day," **Dark chocolate benefits weight loss**

It is undoubtedly counterintuitive to consider chocolate as a central element of a weight loss program. But healthy chocolate – without the additives, sugar, and fat of milk – can help you lose weight.

Having a nugget with a glass of water half an hour before a meal can relieve hunger and satisfy the craving for chocolate. You take in less at mealtimes and benefit from more nutrients. Eating a nugget as a snack is also a healthy alternative to a higher calorie meal.

The important thing is that you can add healthy chocolate to your diet without even a hint of guilt.

**Eat chocolate to lower your blood pressure**

In the United States, a study was conducted by experts and published inJournal of the American Heart Association about the use of dark chocolate to lower blood pressure.

One bar of chocolate is enough to naturally lower blood pressure and, therefore, in a pleasant way. It also helps to improve insulin resistance.

It is then known that foods rich in flavanols lower blood pressure. Flavanols are also known in medical and scientific terminology as natural antioxidants, and foods that contain these antioxidants are similar to tea and red wine. From now on, however, we will add dark chocolate to this list."
keto,I'm looking for a cheap and affordable keto diet plan to lose fat asap,"I'm very poor, I cannot afford meat at all, I'm looking for a relatively cheap diet that doesnt include meat/beef, though chicken is very cheap where I live so chicken can be included, I really want to commit to the diet but whenever I look up a certain plan it always includes bacon, meat...etc"
keto,Am I eating too little? (5'2''/F/150lbs),"I've been doing OMAD for 2 months now and currently average around 900-950kcals everyday. My macros, according to ketocalculator, are 81g of protein, 19g of net carbs, and 58g of fat, and after setting it to a 40% deficit, it says I should be eating 923kcals. I always make sure to reach my protein macros in every meal, sometimes going a bit higher too. I've seen a lot of opinions about eating too little calories or too high of a deficit but so far, I haven't really felt weak or hungry. 

Am I setting myself up for future problems? What should I do if I decide to incorporate light exercise? Or Intense workouts?"
keto,Don't be me.,"So, back on March 13, 2018, I weight 355lbs. That was day 1 of Keto. Over the course of the next year, I lost about 80lbs. Got down to 285, though my flair shows my most recent update of 295. That was about a year ago. Holidays hit, I got a new job, and I got lazy. 

In a year, I've gained almost all of it back. Currently sitting at 348lbs and I am .... disgusted with myself.

Back at it, I go."
keto,Proud of myself despite bad choice,"Today my clinic (work place) hosted a team building, with pastries for breakfast, and lunch of burritos, chips, and salsas pre-packaged per person. Despite all the delicious smells of pastries in the AM with coffee, I only drank bulletproof. For lunch, I resisted every urge in me to eat the burrito and only picked out  the meat. Fortunately they gave me a second to help me fill up a bit because not much meat was in there. Unfortunately, some rice and beans was on my meat. But I didn’t a fast yesterday and was feeling slightly more hungry today. So I brought the leftover burritos (sans meat) home for my partner.

Fast forward to the early evening and I’m starving. I decided to go search for more meat in my burritos but instead caved and started eating small bits of tortilla, rice, beans, telling myself “just one more piece” and before I knew it I had eaten almost half of everything when I stopped. I just stopped right there. I closed the box, and walked away, and came here to type this because for me this is an NSV. 

Old me would have continued bingeing- mindlessly downing BOTH burritos, including the chips and salsa. Then I probably would have had the leftover pastry I also brought, followed by a giant glass of milk, and then lay down social media. 

BUT today I instead recognized my desire to binge and stopped. Instead of looking back and feeling like complete shit, I only feel a bit shit. But I’m proud of myself in a weird way because keto has helped me develop a better and much healthier relationship with food and myself. 

So yeah I fucked up but also go me. 

Thanks for all the endless support. This week I have finally seen some movement on the scale."
keto,Down 60lbs in four months,"I've documented my progress on here a couple of times, and I wanted to check back in just to hold myself accountable and also possibly inspire anyone that is feeling completely hopeless. June of this year, I weighed in at 520lbs. I was very depressed, angry at myself, and overall just exhausted by my losing battle with food addiction. Last weekend, I weighed in at 460 putting my results so far at 60lbs lost. This is not a victory lap post, because these four months haven't been without slip ups and some failures. But with that being said,  I am beginning to feel a little positivity, and also some hope that this lifestyle is something I can manage to maintain, and utilize to reach my goals. Even after I went off track, I found myself wanting to go right back to eating well again. I just feel better. I have an extremely long road ahead, but by viewing this as a lifelong change and not a diet, it seems much less punitive. It's really been enjoyable discovering real food, and taking the time to prepare it, and be thankful for it, instead of just consuming as much junk as I could afford. Anyways, I hope everyone has a nice weekend, and remember to be kind to yourselves and one another. I'll check back soon."
keto,How often do you weigh yourself?,"Backstory: I’ve done keto many times and lost the most weight about three years ago. The last several times I’ve tried I’ve gotten really excited to see the pounds drop at the beginning only to become frustrated when things slowed down a couple of weeks in. 

In this COVID world, I’ve learned to only focus on the things that I *can* change and have control over so I’ve decided to approach my keto journey this time by measuring my success not in pounds but in days of compliance. I’m on day 19 of doing keto and intermittent fasting and plan to stick to it until Christmas Eve and then take a two day break and get right back on the wagon 12/26. 

One of the big reasons I’m doing it this way this time is because some health problems have caused my hormones to be out of wack the last several months and I know that they play a big role in weight retention which in turn affects the scale. My thought is that if I don’t have to see those fluctuations, I won’t be discouraged. I’m thinking that if I’m keeping my calories under budget, eating less than 25g net carbs daily (most days much lower than that), eating enough protein and whole foods, and staying active the weight is going to come off. Focusing on how quickly that’s happening won’t do anything for me. I’m focusing instead on the habits needed to get there and enjoying the NSVs I’m seeing already. 

That said, I would like to track my progress and it’d be helpful to update my apps so that I know how many calories I should be eating. 

How often should I be weighing myself? Is monthly often enough??"

keto,Can I use keto to lose body fat but stay at the same weight?,"Hey guys, my first post here, so be gentle lol

From November last year till august this year I went from 265 pounds to 178 pounds eating healthy, lower calories, and a lot of cardio. 

Weight-wise I'm at my goal I think, but I want to get a more toned body, not necessarily bigger. 

I want to lose body fat but stay at approximately the same weight, would keto + weightlifting program be a good way to do that?

I've read a few different things online and thought I would make my own post so I would get a specific answer to my situation.

keto,Help making a fat filled stir-fry,"Hi all

I'm on keto, been a few weeks (done it previously for a year, so this is no achievement) but I have a poor habit of skipping vegetables.

I'm trying to meal prep and one dish that looked easy to ketoify was a stir-fry.

Use low carb vegetables.
High fat meat (like sausage)
Seseme oil
Little soy sauce, garlic ginger.

Pretty simple, however I worry I won't have enough fat in it.

Anyone have suggestions for upping the fat content?

Thanks for reading."
keto,High LDL,"I've been on Keto for 2 years now. I'm physically (neuromuscular disorder)  disabled and have struggled with weight all my life. I've lost about 30lbs and weigh around 135lbs (5ft4).  I do a cheat day twice a month now that I am at a comfortable weight. My inflammation pain is gone and it comes back for a few days after a cheat day. Overall keto has worked well! 

&amp;#x200B;

I got a new doctor (mine retired) and he is isn't against keto... so he ran a full blood panel and everything was great except LDL was 'extremely high' at 255, HDL at 53 and Triglycerides at 111.  He wanted to put me on Crestor, but is willing to see if I can lower it naturally first.  His concern is heart disease. What can I do? Should I not do keto?

&amp;#x200B;

I was doing MCT Oil in my coffee daily, I can cut that out (35% of daily saturated fat). I eat ground beef 2-3 days a week and chicken the other days. Obviously eat cheese daily on keto. I eat riced cauliflower and riced broccoli and asparagus. I generally fast 12-16 hrs per day. I do drink a lot of coffee with sugar free sweetener. I take omega-3 daily.

&amp;#x200B;

Would daily Niacin help? Green tea? 

&amp;#x200B;

I asked my doctor about a LDL particle test and he said he'd check vLDL in 2 months...

Am I at severe risk at 255 LDL?"

Today I was already going to be out running errands, so I decided to reward myself with a trip to the nail salon instead of doing them at home.. They came out beautiful! It's funny how such a little thing can make a great day even better lol.

Have been this weight for a while-my diet consists mainly of keto still, strict keto (its not hard, its basically a lifestyle now. staying 10 carbs even, pretty easy to be honest!)

But the last 6 or so months, i kinda carb cycle. every 7-14 days, ill go a day with say...100-200 carbs? and then do a 24 hour fast. This has worked pretty well for me and i still find myself dropping body fat pretty easily (i find i need to eat more, i do a lot of weight training, and i feel i dont eat enough) im fairly toned and athletic looking, but i wish i could pack on more muscle!! i think the carb cycling thing has helped with that, as the way i looked before was...skinnyish? and now im much more defined :)

keto,Stomach Pains/Intense Bloating??,"Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

Been doing keto for about 6 months, and I got down to 165/170 at 6'1. This is the lowest I have ever been, and I am in no need to lose anymore! I am so happy with keto :). Anyways, I hit quite the big roadblock. College has been extremely stressful lately, and I started to get very bad stomach pain, which my doctor said was from my anxiety attacks causing my body to produce excess stomach acid, which was damaging my stomach lining. It was very painful, and after EVERY meal, it would get so bad that I would have to lay down. I have since switched back to a regular diet, and I have gradually nursed my stomach back to health. However, the weirdest thing to me is that I know that keto is not unhealthy, but I still get bad stomach pains when I eat a lot of fat. The only exception is when I eat a nice fatty steak. This makes no sense to me at all! I used to LOVE these chocolate avocado smoothies everyday. They were full of healthy fats, and vegetables. It seems I cannot handle any liquid food, and random foods will cause my lots of bloating and pain, to the point where I need to lay down for a couple of hours and sleep it off. Does anybody have any advice? I hate how tired I am on a regular diet, but keto foods seem to irritate my stomach."

By the evening, I felt so strange and off that I decided to eat non-keto. Within hours, I was very sick and am still not feeling well. Has anyone experienced something similar?

- Not enough electrolytes
- Food poisoning
- Eating a sudden non-keto meal

Was it easy for you to start eating or did it gross you out too?

I'd love to hop on this bandwagon, but it gives me the creeps. Silly, I know, as lots of people around the world depend on organ meat and its a totally normal thing to do. It's just not what I'm used to. Best I can do is bone broth, if that even counts."
keto,Reminder: The same stupid candy is on the shelf every other day of the year,"A lot of us have a weakness for halloween candy.  In some way it feels special but I wanted to share a perspective I have on halloween candy:

It is not suddenly special or magical because they have a SPOOKY BAT printed on the side of it.

This is the same mass-produced low quality candy that is at the store the other 364 days per year.  It is made by machines in factories all over the world by the millions with no love and no craftsmanship.  On July 12th I can guarantee you will be able to get the exact same snickers bar as you can on october 31.

The specialness of halloween you had as a youngster was from the adventure.  The magic of dressing up as spiderman and running through a neighborhood transformed and people who loved to see your smiling face rewarded your enthusiasm with treats and a laugh.

THAT was the magic.  The magic was never in the peanut butter cup or the mars bar or in that box of raisins that the neighbor nobody liked handed out.

When you can look at an almond joy (or whatever) and realize that there is nothing special about it, that it has no love in it, I hope it loses power over you and becomes less tempting especially if you are still addicted to the world's most popular drug: sugar.

Best of luck out there, and happy halloween!"

Thank you body again!) and now I'm done and I'm free to do what I want with my diet again so I ate a bunch of key lime pie (my fav dessert) and the next day started keto! 

I'm already down 14 lbs and I'm so happy to back on this downward trend again. This is it for me. I've never known FOR SURE that I have exactly what it takes to meet my goal. I'm not doing this for anyone else. I'm doing this because I'm amazing and I'm ready to show that to the rest of the world.

keto,1.5 Weeks in and Frustrated by Lack of Results,"Hello everyone, I have been creeping on this page for a bit and am finally part of the community.

She has supposedly been having amazing results, losing a pound a day, while I not so much. I have not lost anything, and am really becoming frustrated. I understand things take time but I thought I would reach out and see if anyone could lend some tips or even just words of encouragement if they experienced delayed results. 

Throughout my life I have never really tried when dieting, and I finally am and this lack of results, while my coworker is raving about her successes, is honestly making me feel like I want to give up. I have started tracking my macros thinking that was the issue, but I am meeting all goals, if not a little below, so I don't think that's it.

keto,Help! Went through Extreme stress and need help getting back on track!,"Hi All! 

Long story short, I lost 35 pounds on keto. Love it made it my lifestyle since June 5 2019. I’m a 36 year old  medium framed 5’4” female whose goal weight was 135 and I was at 140 this august, but then was hospitalized, had to move and uproot my entire life and move across the country in a week to a place I had never been.

keto,Keto and balding,"Hello,I’m a male with hereditary balding.

I’m taking medications to slow down the process and it worked for the most part, however lately I did many things that are linked to my current shedding and keto is one of them.

I take accutane a drug that causes hair loss, the dermatologist told me it causes hair thinning not loss so it’s not the reason.

I’m cutting too much calories like sub 1k a day but this week I raised them above 1k.

I’m doing keto as well and heard imbalanced diet causes hair loss well, high protein is linked to hair loss ?

I started weight lifting and I know it’s not good idea to lift with low calories but at least I eat more than 100g of proteins a day and I read that as long as you eat enough protein ( still not enough I know but I’m gonna buy protein shakes to help raise them ) Helps in muscle growth.

I’m just depressed cuz I wanna do many things simultaneously, keep my hair + lose weight + bulk but I feel these things are mutually exclusive and idk if I can do it properly."
keto,What is it worth?,"Something that's been on my mind lately, especially when I'm reflecting on the effort to stay committed to losing weight or the money I spend on keto-friendly food... what is it worth to me?

&amp;#x200B;

If I could pay someone to snap their fingers I was suddenly at my goal weight and would stay there, what would I be willing to pay? What if it was going to take a while to happen, a few months or a year, but they would do all the work... what would I be willing to pay? $10,000? Almost certainly. Who knows how much further I'd go... if it was really that easy.

&amp;#x200B;

Now think about it like you're paying yourself for the work. Think about it like you're putting that money towards your food budget, put some of it toward rewarding yourself (not food) for the progress. When I think about it, I've never earned/saved so much money before so easily in my spare time.

keto,Worried about my dirty keto being unhealthy,"I know that ""there is no dirty keto, if it fits your macros, it's okay"", but humor me anyway, please.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 24/M/90.5kg/182cm, and I am vegetarian (for the most part). Basically this means I was born and brought up strict vegetarian, and meat makes me queasy when I tried it after growing up. It is not an option for me.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what typical meals for me look like: [https://imgur.com/a/OdvXu0s](https://imgur.com/a/OdvXu0s)

As above, I usually take 2-3 scoops of protein with 3 raw eggs, and blend them together and drink it up. This has helped me hugely in keeping up with the protein macro, and I barely have other options.  I don't like eggs, and this makes it tolerable. I tend not to get a lot of veggies either, just some 1/2 cup of okra/cauliflower/broccoli every now and then. I tried things like cheeses, but consuming it for filling my protein macro made me hate it. I am concerned about downing 2-3 scoops of protein and raw eggs everyday like this in the long run.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this sustainable without health repercussions in the future? Any advice on what you would change in this? Any other advice at all?

&amp;#x200B;

footnote: I make sure to get my recommended sodium, potassium, magnesium everyday and hydrate like a bear (about 3.5 Litres everyday minimum), I am on OMAD, and eat all that at once at night. At a \~30% deficit right now, about 1 month into keto so far."
keto,Eating habits on keto while at chipotle.,"It's insane. I love chipotle and would generally get a double steak burrito with guac. the rice and beans and tortilla made this meal 1300 calories and 100 net carbs. I would walk away feeling 'bloated' but not necessarily full, and would often eat another big meal later or chips with queso immediately after.

remove the rice and beans and tortilla and its down to just 655 calories and only 7 net carbs. I walk away feeling so full i will often not eat anything else until nightfall, where maybe I'll have a snack or a small fish.

The rice and beans and tortilla are nice, don't get me wrong, but the key to the flavor was always the steak and guac and sour cream and tomato, rice and beans are more bland than anything. It's crazy how removing food can make you feel more full for the rest of the day and less gross."

keto,How to Use Keto Diet for Weight Loss and What to Expect,"# What is Ketosis &amp; How Does It Promote Fat Loss?

Normally, carbohydrates that you eat (especially sugar) raise insulin levels, preventing your body from burning fat.

But on the keto diet, the lack of carbs and insulin allows for maximum fat-burning.

And when your body switches to fat as its primary energy source, your liver produces high-energy ketone molecules during the breakdown of fats.

Ketosis occurs when you eat a very low carb diet or fast for prolonged periods. 

In a state of ketosis, ketone bodies act as a clean-burning, readily available fuel source for your brain and vital organs.

**Note**: Unlike metabolic ketoacidosis, nutritional ketosis is perfectly safe.

Conventional diets usually require a caloric deficit to cause *weight loss*, which isn’t the same thing as fat loss.

##### “Eating less and moving more” is a guaranteed way to lose weight, but evidence suggests that compared to the keto diet, you could lose more lean muscle and less fat by following a traditional weight loss diet.

Along with the unique fat loss benefits of going keto, there are also many remarkable health benefits due to ketosis.

### Health Benefits of Ketosis

The health benefits of keto come from your body burning fat for fuel, the presence of ketones circulating in your bloodstream, and lower insulin and blood glucose levels.

Along with accelerated fat loss, here’s what happens when you go keto:

* Possible skin improvements in those with acne
* Improved triglyceride and cholesterol levels
* Easier blood glucose management for overweight people and people with type 2 diabetes
* Hormone regulation — many women who go on keto report less severe symptoms of PMS
* Better mood and increase cognition
* Higher energy levels and less fatigue
* No feeling of deprivation because you experience less hunger

Aside from the health benefits of ketosis, many people fall in love with keto because of how it makes them feel, both mentally and physically.

Next, learn what to expect as far as weight loss when you go keto.

# Keto Diet Weight Loss Results: What to Expect

Everyone’s keto weight loss story is different. Results vary depending on starting body fat levels, fitness, age, and personal health history.

Fortunately, there’s now plenty of peer-reviewed evidence that sheds light on what you can expect when you go keto.

A 6-month study in 2004 observing the long-term effects of a ketogenic diet in obese adults and found the following:

* The patients’ weight decreased significantly, by an average of over **14 kilograms (31 pounds)**.
* The majority of the weight loss took place in the first two months, but weight loss continued throughout the study.
* The level of **total cholesterol** decreased from week 1 to week 24.
* **HDL cholesterol** (the “good” one) levels significantly increased.
* **LDL cholesterol** (the “bad” one) levels significantly decreased after treatment.
* The level of **triglycerides** decreased significantly following 24 weeks of treatment.
* The level of **blood glucose** significantly decreased.

A separate 6-month study in 2012 compared the effects of a ketogenic diet versus a hypocaloric (low-calorie) diet in obese children and adolescents. Here’s what the results showed:

* Children following the ketogenic experienced significantly increased **reductions in body weight (8 kg or 17.6 lb)**, **fat mass (7 kg or 15.4 lb)**, **waist circumference (9.2 cm or 3.7 inches)**, and fasting insulin levels compared to the low-calorie diet.
* The children in the ketogenic diet group significantly reduced insulin resistance to a greater degree than those following a hypocaloric diet.
* An important marker of insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular disease — known as high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin — significantly increased in the ketogenic diet group but not in the hypocaloric diet group.

And here’s what a 2017 randomized controlled study of recreational Crossfit athletes found when they went keto for 6 weeks:

* **Keto subjects lost 3.45 kilograms (7.6 pounds)**, whereas the control group lost no weight.
* **Keto participants’ body fat percentage dropped by an average of 2.6 points**, while the control group’s body fat did not change significantly.
* **The keto group lost, on average, 2.83 kilograms (6.2 pounds) of fat mass** (the portion of the body composed strictly of fat), unlike the control group, who did not lose any fat mass.
* **Improvements in lean body mass and Crossfit performance were identical** between the two groups, meaning keto did **not** decrease performance.                                                                                         

Other studies have also found positive results for fat loss and overall health, including in adults living with type 2 diabetes.

Essentially, no matter who you are, going keto supports healthy weight loss without counting calories. 

And not only that, but it can also improve important health measures like cholesterol, blood sugar, and insulin levels.

### Keto vs. Popular Weight Loss Diets: Atkins, Paleo, Mediterranean

Here are the similarities and differences between keto and the Atkins, Paleo, and Mediterranean diets:

&amp;#x200B;

Keto may be the easiest diet for weight loss. Unlike other diets, the ketogenic diet significantly suppresses your desire to eat, which often allows fat loss without counting calories.

And equally importantly, none of the other diets result in ketone production or boost fat-burning like keto. 

Therefore, the keto diet has unique health benefits not found with Atkins, Paleo, or the Mediterranean diet.

## Designing a Keto Plan for Weight Loss

Before you get started losing fat with keto, there are a few things you’ll want to do first for best results.

Along with planning ahead, you’ll want to **set a weight loss goal** and **do plenty of research**.

The key to goal-setting is to set an ambitious goal that motivates you. 

Some people feel motivated by extreme goals, while others prefer to set goals that feel realistic and attainable. 

If you belong to the second group, you can always make a follow-up goal after you achieve your initial weight loss target.

When it comes to keto weight loss results, 1-2 pounds per week is a safe and sustainable target. You might shed pounds faster, especially at first, but you’ll be better off if you don’t *force* rapid weight loss.

Therefore, plan accordingly. For example, if your goal is to lose 20 pounds, expect to take around 10-20 weeks to get there (2.5 to 5 months, in other words).

And remember to do your homework, so you have a reasonably good understanding of every aspect of the keto diet.

We’ll cover the basics in a moment, but here are some other important areas to consider before you begin:

However, I like sharing this inspirational article with people as to show how Stephanie lost 250 pounds on keto and this really helps on motivation and keeps on track to hit our daily weight loss goals. I use post like this as motivation daily for many things as positivity is the key and there is nothing better than seeing results like this.

keto,Still feel fat.....,"I have done keto before and lost weight several times. I always eased back into carbs and felt awful afterwards mentally and physically. Several years later I get diagnosed with type-2 Diabetes and had no choice but to go cold turkey. Well a little over a year later I'm down 200 pounds from 450 to 250 pounds. I feel better than I have ever in my life and will be able to go on amusement park rides with my kids this coming summer Covid willing. 😆
Well my question is does anyone else who has been FFL, fat for life still think they look fat??? I mean it's weird. I look in the mirror and I still look real fat and I see a XL sized shirt which is my size now and I feel like it will never fit me but somehow magically it slides right on no problem. I look just as fat to myself in the mirror as I did before I started Keto but in my mind I know I'm not. Not sure if I'm making sense or not but it is a really weird feeling."
keto,Please Help Me!,"I've posted in here before. I lost quite a bit of weight on keto in the past, but since the holidays last year, I got off the diet and got back into binge eating. I tried a few times to get back on it, but when COVID hit, I didn't have many other options, so I continued my ways. I gained over a hundred pounds back I previously lost. I made the decision that I couldn't do it anymore and decided to get back into the keto diet and do it strictly. I even got back involved with the bariatric clinic for support.

At my heaviest, my last weigh-in was 641. I knew I couldn't keep going like that or I wouldn't survive. Jumping back into keto and intermittent fasting, I was eating 1,200 or fewer calories per day. Some days I was eating 500-900 calories. Literally, I had maybe 4 cheat meals the whole month but still didn't go crazy.

I would have a keto shake (Keto Science Meal Replacement) at around noon and dinner at around 3. Dinner was a protein and veggies. That's it. No desserts. No sugar. No carbs. I would drink water or Zevia soda. This morning, I woke up excited for my weigh-in, expecting at least 30 pounds of weight loss. I get to my doctor and the scale says I only lost 4 pounds.

FOUR POUNDS! I cried on the way home. I worked so hard. I don't know what happened. I was so strict on keto that I'm dealing with kidney stones. I have to lose 75 pounds to get my surgery and now I'm essentially starting over this month. I have NO CLUE how I only lost 4 pounds this month. I've lost 10 pounds in a week before. At 637 now, I should be burning a ton of calories.  People on My 600 Pound life lose 50-60 pounds in a month eating this many calories. I can't figure out what I did wrong."

keto,Need advice from a ketoer who was prediabetic &amp; possibly suffered with gastritis,"Hi all, would like to thank ppl in advance for any advice you can give me.  I have been diagnosed recently as prediabetic on top of the gastritis issues I’ve had for the past 1-1/2 yrs.  My gastritis is getting worse as I wait to see a Gastroenterologist, so my choices in foods is limited.  In the past, I’ve tried keto unsuccessfully, was meticulous with counting macros &amp; weighing food, leaving a little extra room to make sure I wasn’t ever over the recommended grams.  I was also counting calories to never be more than 1100/day plus I exercised as much as I could on my elliptical.  Never lost any weight.  Now that I’ve been diagnosed as prediabetic, it seems to be somewhat of a reason as to why it’s so difficult to lose the weight (I was always hypoglycemic - Dr’s don’t know why the sudden change).  I recently started keto again, never going over more than 10g of carbs &amp; nowhere near the recommended fat grams - I’m focusing more on protein consumption, hoping this would be the trick.  After being super conscientious of my intake from Mon to today, I’ve *gained* 2 lbs!  My elliptical broke down on me &amp; we’ve had freezing rain the last couple days so it’s tough to get any exercise in (live in a small place as well).  I want to lose at least 40 lbs, it’s been SO frustrating!  Would really like some advice from anyone who experienced the same thing, thank you!"
keto,Food logging and cooking times,"I'm finally getting serious and logging my food to make sure I'm keeping myself honest.

Boneless skinless chicken thighs are one of my go-to foods, but I like to cook the hell out of them, until they're a little crunchy around the edges and pretty dry and chewy (yeah, I know it's weird).  I'm thinking this must change how I log them. Cooked so long, they are smaller than if they were cooked ""properly,"" as more of the water is gone. So 5 overcooked ounces is more chicken that it would be under normal circumstances.

I could log from raw, I guess, but that seems hard as they are not of uniform size when I put them in the oven.

Were you me, would you adjust? Thanks."

keto,Keto vision improvement! Has anyone else experienced this?,"My vision was slowly deteriorating as i aged. In my mid 20s I had blurry vision when I tried to read store names across the street or reading the bus number of a distant approaching bus! I never got prescription glasses because I was in denial that my eyesight was that bad. 

I always blamed it on ""dry eyes"" or ""pollution"" in the air. 

The only thing ive changed in my life is going keto. My eyesight has gotten insanely good. I can focus my eyes on distant objects without going crosseyed trying to concentrate.

For dessert I'll have 4 blueberries or a couple of blackberries instead of half a sheet of brownies. Weight is shedding fast as I'm down 20 lbs in 2 weeks with 16:8 and keto to boot. 

My question: should I be losing weight in a healthier manner? 20 in 2 weeks seems a bit extreme (obviously i will plateau and loss will stop being so dramatic). It shows how much I had to lose with just my snacking and sugar consumption. If I am worried about sagging skin should I take it easier on my diet?

Job keeps me walking about 10-15 miles M-F in a warehouse. I never thought i could really control my appetite before trying this and I think it showed how addicted to sugar and carbs I was. Never tried dieting before and now I realize I can control my appetite so want to go about losing 80 pounds in a healthy way.

keto,Quick Note: Keto isn't for everyone.,"Wait. Before I get lynched here, let me explain.

Yes, if done right, the keto diet will work for 99% of people (very very rare exceptions).

However, this diet doesn't work for those who quit easily. However, this diet doesn't work for those who value quick satisfaction over long term success.
However, this diet doesn't work for those who don't think things through.

Once you get used to it, keto is as easily as can be. But if you're just in it for weight loss, or you cheat and eat carbs every week, you'll just be bouncing in and out of keto flu. And it WILL NOT WORK. 

This diet works for those who are patient. Those who value health over momentary, short term happiness. Who care more about their health in 3 years, rather than their weight in 3 weeks."

So, I'm kind of a newbie to keto (currently on Week 6; female, 24, 5'5"", SW: 151#, CW: \~135# GW: n/a, I just want shredded abs) and I realized too late (like most newbies) that I need to be seriously supplementing electrolytes. I started putting Lite Salt on literally everything I eat, incorporated a ton more mushrooms and spinach, and I take a 250 mg magnesium supplement every night before bed. That said, I still feel like I'm definitely low on sodium and potassium. 

I saw that a ton of people here do ketorade with Natural Calm, lite salt, and Mio, but I recently saw a lot of articles and YouTube videos and such that say the artificial sweeteners in Mio cause an insulin response that's significant enough to throw you out of ketosis. Additionally, I'm doing 18:6 intermittent fasting, and it seems pretty unanimous that Mio will break your fast because of the insulin spike it causes. 

Does anyone have any knowledge of or experience with this? / If everything I've been reading is true and Mio is an insulin response in a low-carb disguise, any suggestions on how I can continue to supplement Natural Calm and lite salt without feeling like I'm choking down a mouthful of ocean water?

keto,Experience with Diet Coke &amp; Stalling Progress,"Hi fellow keto people. 
I've been on Keto for the past 8 months. I'm 5'7 and started at 172lb, and am now down to 154lb (BMI of 23.9). At first I came off diet coke as my preferred drink at meal times (and sometimes inbetween. I relaxed this rule in the summer months round about August. Ever since then I've experienced a stall. I think after 2 months I can now finally call it a proper stall. I've been around 154 LB +2lb/-1lb for two months now. I did notice that my diet coke consumption has gone up quite a bit again.. back to pre-diet levels of.. well.. 3-4 cans a day during meal times.
I've quit it now again 2 days ago, going cold turkey. As I continue to monitor things, I was wondering:

keto,How I overcame a plateau,"Im a M21/5’7/148lbs (starting weight 187lbs) and I started keto + intermittent fasting 6 months ago, I also run 4 days a week. I hit my first plateau 3 months in and my progress halted for 2 weeks. I got worried at first but then I decided to give myself a break for a few days and see what happens. So for a week I stopped intermittent fasting and ate at maintenance calories (or a bit over hehe). I was still keto and I didn’t stop running during this period. The week after that I got back to my previous plan and within the first week I lost 3 pounds and I have been shedding weight ever since. I can’t guarantee this works for everybody but it won’t hurt to try.

TL;DR - Give yourself a break from the calorie deficit for a week and jump back on after."

I didn’t lose a single pound for the first month or so.. and in the last week, 189 &gt; 182 (25 /male /5’8’’). 7 pounds in a week! Seems to be dropping everyday, this is so exciting and motivating.

keto,Need help with Navigating Keto with Kidney Problems,"Hey ya'll I need help with information regarding what to eat and more importantly what not to eat due to my condition.
Basically I'm highly susceptible to Kidney Stones and in desperate need to go on Keto for other illnesses that I deal with mainly obesity.
I have a pretty good understanding of Keto and have tried it in the past so I'm good with the basics.
I'd appreciate any help with this issue.
Thank you for the time you took to read and possibly comment."
keto,I created an open-source tool to parse and report your calories and net carbs from cronometer,"I really like to display my calorie and net carb info on my macOS menu bar. I also like to show my significant other my live data on an iPad screen to stay accountable.

There isn't an easy way to get this data from cronometer so I built this tool.

keto,If you don't feel good on keto or carnivore diet...please stop,"I know this will probably meet a lot of criticism from people who do well on low-carb diets, but this post is not for them. It's for the people who don't feel well on them and I'm hoping I can stop someone from going through the suffering that I'm going through.

Long story short, I was made to believe that keto/low carb diets were the key to health and that humans evolved eating this way. I'm not here to debate whether or not this is true. I'm here to say that some people do well on these diets and others crash and burn on them. Keto advocates will make you believe that if you don't feel well on it, you are either doing something wrong or you haven't become fat-adapted yet. This might be true for some people, but for me it was not, and I suspect many other people don't mesh well with these diets either.

I ate low carb, then keto and then carnivore for a combined 3+ years. At first I felt great for a few days and then I felt terrible. Eventually it turned into extreme anxiety, panic attacks etc. I know it sounds stupid that I felt this way and continued it for so long, but the advocates of these diets (especially carnivore) are so dogmatic and convincing that they can show you endless ""proof"" that they are the answer to health and happiness. If you don't feel good it's either not the diet, you're doing it wrong or you're not adapted to it yet.

On top of that, there are an endless amount of testimonials from people claiming that these keto and carnivore diets changed their lives for the better. Unfortunately this went on for 3+ years before I decided that I had enough.

I finally started eating carbs again about 6 months ago and although I've made very small improvements, I have done serious damage to some part of my body or brain that I'm hoping is reversible. I have to hope this because otherwise my life will be torture every waking minute for the rest of my life.

I have a weird feeling of pressure in my head, my pulse is weak and slow, I'm dizzy, I have constant anxiety every minute of every day, I wake up feeling like I have a really bad hangover every day even though I never drink....and the list goes on and on. No doctor can explain what the problem is or how to solve it, meaning my only hope is to keep eating carbs and hope that, whatever the problem is, it will slowly resolve itself.

My explanation doesn't do justice to how I feel every day. Every waking minute of every day is just a reminder that the rest of my life is going to feel like torture. I find no joy in anything and all I can think about is how bad I feel. I used to be cool and collected but now I have uncontrollable anger and anxiety issues. I've lost all of my friends. My son doesn't want to be around me anymore. I've basically lost everything I had and everyone I cared about. I have nothing left, all because of a diet.

This isn't a sob story so people will feel bad for me. I don't care what people think. This is a warning for others. If you decided to try a keto or carnivore diet (or any low carb style diet) and you feel like shit after several weeks of trying to ""adapt"" then STOP DOING THE DIET. Do not listen to anyone telling you you're doing something wrong or you haven't adapted yet. It means that you're the type of person who needs carbs in your diet to thrive. DO NOT KEEP GOING.

If this post can help even one person avoid the problems I've caused for myself, then maybe I can turn my endless misery into something positive for someone else."
keto,Staying below 20 g carbs but not enough protein/fat?,"First off, I’m sorry for posting so many questions, I’m only on my 2nd day and it’s just really overwhelming and difficult for me to decipher accurate information from misinformation. 

My ideal macros/stats are (according to the calculator): 

4’10” (147cm) Female 20yo CW 102lbs GW 93-95lbs 

1035kcal Daily Calorie Intake 20g Carbs (8%, 80 kcal) 70g Protein (27%, 280 kcal) 75g Fat (65%, 675 kcal)

Thing is, at the moment I’m consuming about 13-15g net carbs a day, 45g protein and about 50g fat. Totaling around 850 calories 

I just can’t stomach more protein or fat rich foods in a day because keto meals already make me really full/nauseous. I think I’m getting more carb percentage than ideal, thinking of my total calories, but it’s still under 20g. 

I used to basically live off carbs, (til 3 days ago lol) so the protein and healthy fats rich food is quite taxing on my body. 

Basically, is 13-15 g of carbs okay out of my 850 kcal? Or do I need to stick to the percentage and lower my carbs? 

Also, I hate to be that one person but I don’t love leafy greens, and I can’t eat a lot of meat because it makes me feel a bit sick, are there any other tasty veggies/foods that are keto friendly? I know this sounds complainy and I’ll try to eat more leafy greens and meats if I need to. Just wondering about the alternatives, because as far as I know most foods that are “keto friendly” still have a pretty significant amount of carbs in them compared to spinach and meats. 

Thank you so much in advance."
keto,How much body fat can you metabolise per day?,"Hi everyone.

Assuming I am ""overweight"" by some accepted defintion, lets say by 5 kgs (4% of current body weight) and BMR is 1650 calories per day:

Is there a generally accepted maximum body fat you can metabolise per day in contribution to that BMR?

If you are overweight can you effectively cut all carbs and fat, and just consume enough protein and Veg (minerals / vitamins etc.) to maintain a healthy system?

Thanks!"
keto,Milk and Keto Protein Shakes?,"Hi everyone, I am rather new to the keto experience (2 weeks in now) I decided to buy myself keto protein powder for my mornings as I generally skip breakfast, but have noticed that I have little to no energy by lunchtime and with the shake I don't have that issue.

My concern is that I am technically suppose to drink it with water, which I am not use to at all as other shakes I have used in the past were always mixed with milk, so now I am wondering how negative an impact it would be to be using milk instead every day (1 shake in the morning) The milk I am using has a net carb value of 10g and my other meals for the day generally only equate to about 5g net carbs.

Is it fine for me to continue taking taking the shake as is with milk or do I need to just suck it up and deal with the water for it?"
keto,How do I do keto without inconveniencing my family?,"So for backstory, I did keto about 2.5 years ago with my parents. I lost around a total of 70 pounds and was the smallest I’d been in years (like 170). Since then I’ve moved out, gotten engaged and ended up moving in with my fiancé’s family around the time COVID started. (We both lost our jobs due to the pandemic). Now things are going back to normal and we’re both working again, but over the last couple years and especially during quarantine, I’ve gained back everything I’ve lost and then some. We don’t have a scale, so I don’t have my precise weight, but I’m covered in stretch marks and feel absolutely horrible, so I know I’ve put on a lot. I’ve started excercising (walking around the neighborhood and push ups) and traded out soda for water, but I still feel like I’m not making any progress. So I’d like to get back to keto. The only problem is that my fiancé’s family does all the grocery shopping and they order a ton of doordash and pizza etc. They all were lucky and got the naturally skinny genes, but every time I eat a burger or mashed potatoes it goes straight to my beer gut or my ass. What’s the best way to politely refuse what they normally eat for keto options? I know this may seem like a dumb question but I don’t want to be rude and tbh my people skills aren’t really up to snuff. Also, if you guys have any suggestions on stupidly easy keto meals that pretty much anyone could throw together for cheap, I would be very grateful (21/m and can’t cook to save my life lol)."
keto,Nausea with meat and keto,"Im going to preface this with the fact that I LOVE meat. I especially love red meat, including a tender juicy steak. So this is by no means an anti-meat post. Meat equals life!
However, I find that occasionally when on a keto/ketovore diet (and typically during the transition phase), I sometimes go through these periods where I am off-put, almost repulsed by meat. I don’t like the smell, it makes me nauseous, I loose my appetite when trying to eat it, and I have to force it down. Luckily this stage is usually short-lived, lasts a few days to a week or so...but...what gives?
I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if there are any theories on why this happens? Also, anything that helps?

Ive noticed if I push through this phase of keto adaption, I find myself loving meat once again. It is a rough patch to get through though when 90% of your diet is meat."

keto,Stick with it?,"
Six weeks ago, I decided to change and lose the weight that I had gained from Lockdown. I’m 24M 6’3”, weighed in at 298.8 and MISERABLE. I tried working out pretty intensely with some HIIT and Strength Training and coupled that with A reduced calorie “flexible eating” pattern. However, I wasn’t seeing any scale changes and I decided to pivot. 

Three weeks ago, I decided to revisit my good friend Keto. I had success on keto in the past before and got to my lowest of 248lbs. However, I’m pretty impatient and inconsistent thus bringing the scale back up rather than down. In these three weeks, I have managed to weigh in at 285.6 lbs resulting in 13 pounds down which is great but I can’t help but think it’s all due to water weight and that I won’t continue to see a decline. 

My question 

How do you stick in there when things seem impossible?"
keto,Help!!,"I've been doing keto for about 3 weeks counting my macros making sure I'm on track and not breaking it. Hitting the gym daily or every other day.

keto,Red dry skin that's flaking off on one side of nose,"Hey guys,

I've been doing keto off and on for about 8 months or so. I stopped for a few months during quarantine, but I've been back on for many many months - with maybe 1 cheat day a month (I think it's more like every 2 months, but I'm not sure).

In the last month, I noticed redness on my nose. I thought my skin was dry because of the changing season (Ottawa, rapid drastic seasonal changes), so I started putting on moisturizer - which I thought helped.

But at one point or another, a concerningly large flake of dry skin came off and when I looked in the mirror to investigate, my nose was redder and almost purple? I don't mean purple purple.. but reddish purple.

I applied polysporin thinking (hoping) that it was something that was unusual and passing. And once again, it seemed to get better... but then it came back the same and maybe worse.

I've been consuming electrolytes, I've been mindful of vitamins (I take a multi, b complex, D, and sometimes C), along with collagen. It sounds like a lot. I wasn't normally taking ALL that, but I was certain that I'm deficient in some micronutrient and was hoping one of these supplements would help.

In other reddit posts, people have spoken about keto rash. I've looked up images on Google and it looks nothing like it. Other people have spoken of Rosacea. I guess the left side of my nostril resembles early rosacea, but not really and it's isolated to that one spot (for now) and I don't remember experiencing symptoms like this before. 

I'm fairly certain it has something to do with Keto. I'm not super mindful of eating, other than keeping carbs really low and eating a lot of fat. I hadn't been concerned about eating enough because I still had weight to lose (247 pounds to 185, so far), and i justified it by telling myself that I was taking vitamins and whatnot. But now I'm concerned.

I did some research and found links from Rosacea to bad bacteria overgrowth in my gut. I wonder, if this is all due to bad gut health. Aside from a large salad usually every day, I don't have much fiber. I don't know if this affects my gut health. Today I decided to drink some apple cider vinegar, and later on I used some metamucil, and further later on I had some probiotics. I'll update if this helps anything.

Other information that may help: 

\- I eat at least one big meal a day. I'm not starving myself. Today I had a good breakfast, with some meat later on. No greens, however. Now that I'm thinking about it, I'll go mix up a veggie drink.

\- I'm a 31 year old. Up until about 2 months ago I had a second job as a bartender which I had done since my early twenties. This was a big chunk of my exercise. Gyms are closed right now due to Covid so my only exercise is walking my dog, pushups, squats, curls, and nighttime cardio. I don't know if exercise info will help, but whatever... I'll paint the picture if it gets me some good suggestions.

Has anyone experienced this? I admit that I could have been far more thoughtful about what I was eating, but overall I thought I was doing pretty good and this is the most thought I've ever put into my diet. I feel better than I've ever felt, aside from my irritated nose that looks stupid. I'm at a bit of a loss here. Anyone know anything that could help me out?

Sorry about the long post."
keto,Need help please. My daughter’s cholesterol is high now.,"Hello everyone, I’m writing on mobile, sorry for horrible formatting.

My husband and I were doing lazy keto and loving it. I have three children who are on the thin side so I would have them eat a lot of our keto meals plus some meals or side dishes we couldn’t eat. Recently we had to have one of my kid’s blood checked and found out her cholesterol was high, she is 12 years old. It never even crossed my mind that our doing keto would raise their cholesterol especially since they are all thin. My husband and I decided to give the food pyramid a try instead so that we could focus more on the kids eating less animal products. I don’t think I could handle two completely separate diet plans for the family. 

As expected, my husband and I eating carbs again brought back an addiction like behavior. We have no will power. The food pyramid was mostly forgotten and we started eating every delicious carb we had been craving for months. I have always hated counting calories and I know the only way I would possibly be able to lose weight on the “healthy” eating plan is by decreasing my caloric intake to 1200 calories. We tried it for a week and I was starving and miserable. All of the wonderful changes my body made on keto disappeared. 

Please help me figure out a way for my husband and I to do keto while still lowering my kid’s cholesterol. On keto I probably made too many meals with red meat or cheeses. Since I am the only one who is cooking I always had cheese cubes for people to snack on since it was easy. I need ideas for easy snacks that all can grab and somewhat easy dinners that are lower cholesterol. A few times a week I don’t mind making the kids something else but not every day. My kids tend to do breakfast and lunch without us so really it’s just dinner and snacks needed along with any other advice or suggestions. Thank you all for any help you can give me."

keto,‘It’s been life-changing for me — to say the least’,"When Joseph’s weight hit an all-time high of 385 pounds (or 175 kilos), he decided enough was enough. To turn his health around, he started following a keto diet and intermittent fasting

&amp;#x200B;

In just eight months, Joseph lost 137 pounds (or 62 kilos). Not only did he lose the weight, but he also noticed the pain he formerly experienced in his joints had largely disappeared.

&amp;#x200B;

Here, Joseph shares the inspiring results he’s gotten since starting keto and fasting. He describes his low-carb journey as “life-changing.”

&amp;#x200B;

Joseph’s story

Hello Diet Doctor!

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Joseph, I’m 41, and I’m from Indiana, USA.

&amp;#x200B;

As of October 22, 2019, I weighed a whopping 385 pounds (or 175 kilos). At that point, I had trouble just moving around and putting my shoes on was a chore in itself.

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up, I was always fit. I played sports and was also in the marines. Years later, I found myself never watching what I ate or drank — and the weight just piled on.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I knew it, I was at 385 pounds (or 175 kilos). I saw that 400-pound (or 181-kilo) mark coming soon. I just couldn’t believe it and finally refused to live like that anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I read and listened to podcasts with keto and fitness experts. For example, I listened to “FoundMyFitness” by Dr. Rhonda Patrick, as well as, those featuring Dr. Dominic D’Agostino, one of the leading researchers in the field of ketosis.

&amp;#x200B;

From October 22, 2019, to June 22, 2020, I lost 137 pounds (or 62 kilos) with keto and intermittent fasting. I’ll keep going to my goal of reaching 200 pounds (or 91 kilos). It’s been life-changing for me — to say the least.

&amp;#x200B;

Eating keto has helped me to feel so much better! I used to have inflammation in all of my joints, especially in my shoulders, and I could hardly raise my arms above my head without experiencing pain. Now, my lower back pain, knee pain, and feet all feel tremendously better.

&amp;#x200B;

What Joseph ate before and what he eats now

What I ate before keto was, well … everything. I couldn’t count how many Mountain Dews I drank a day. Had I attempted to keep track, I’m sure the intake of sugar from soda alone would have scared me. For food, I ate pretty much all fast food and pizza — and everything I ate was full of carbs.

&amp;#x200B;

These days, with fasting, I start eating around noon and stop around 8 pm. Surprisingly, with fasting, my hunger and cravings have gone down a lot. My go-to is usually eggs, steak, ground beef, or slow cooking chicken in a crockpot. Usually, I prepare batches of food that will last me for a few days.

&amp;#x200B;

I drink about half a gallon (or two liters) of water a day as well.

I've been on keto for about 2 weeks now. 

I've had plenty of sneaky carbs in the beginning, probably why I haven't lost that much weight yet.

**But these days my typical menu is like this:**

**Breakfast:**  Coffee with almond milk/Anchor squirty cream  

If I'm really hungry, I'd also have some cheese/Kalamata olives. 

**Lunch:** 3 eggs omelet cooked in coconut oil spray with salt/pepper/peri peri salt and sometimes 2 tbsp of Philipedia cheese. Also, stir-fried mushrooms or broccoli. 

**Or** Cooked chicken slices (200-250 g) from Asda with stir-fried mushrooms or broccoli. 

**Absolutely can't be asked days:** 2 Cans of Scottish Mackerel in Tomato sauce cooked in some coconut oil spray with seasoning. 

**Dinner:** One of the lunch options. 

**Some days:** Just lunch or dinner not both.  

**When I have time/mood:** Fresh poussin, or chicken thighs, marinated and cooked with love. 

**Snacks/Desserts: 1 or 2 diet coke every day is a must :(**  I have also been enjoying frozen yogurt lollies (6-10 carbs per lolly) on those odd days. Wensleydale cheese with cranberries is becoming my new favorite. But trying my best to keep these to a minimum. 

**What do you ladies eat on a typical day?** 

And how much weight have you lost if you don't mind sharing?"
keto,Inspo for second time around!,"Hi all - I successfully stuck with keto for about eight months a couple of years ago, and went from 170+ pounds to 130 pounds (F, 40 years old, 5’5”).

keto,Resting Heart rate,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone experiences an increased heart rate with keto. I find when I do keto my RHR is always at least 5- 20 BPM higher. For example when I wake up in the morning it is low 60’s and during sleep, whereas when I was eating carbs  during sleep it would be very low 50’s. I am already lean. Is keto not beneficial if you are already lean? Or is this increase RHR simply a cortisol spike from starting again. 

I always feel better mentally when I do a ketogenic diet but I’m afraid my cortisol is spiking or something which is causing the increase RHR. Been taking magnesium last few days and haven’t noticed much of a difference."
keto,Keto + IF for intense training questions,"Hello! Newcomer here and it was awesome to join this community and read how Keto changes peoples' life in a positive way! I have been relatively new to Keto diet and always have been doing IF more or less. However, I'm struggling to find a balance of these and have some questions for those who have dealt with similar experience. For me, I'm 34 years old, 5'8, 155lbs, 14%bf, and do intense exercise daily (either running, calisthenics or MMA related stuff). My observation since starting Keto is below:

1. I always have been a healthy eater but generally I consume food with large quantity. I found out that it is extremely difficult to have enough calories on keto without overly consuming animal protein which is another thing I'm exploring given the claim of the possible detrimental effect of the reliance on animal products.
2. Impact on athletic performance: that's somewhat expected given that I'm taking out the fuel that my body relies on for a long time. But just wondering for those who have been on Keto for a long time, do you perform as good as before, in both endurance and explosive exercise?
3. For those who are in Ketosis, if you have to ""take a day off"" during special occasions, e.g. weddings, holidays etc. Is it easy to go back to Ketosis in general? Or will the process get easier overtime?
4. What's your experience in combining Keto + IF, or is it too much?

Thanks!!"

keto,Ever thought about eating straight up Aoli?,"Call me weird but I don’t see a problem with it. Aoli is delicious and is basically solely fat. Have some spoonfuls of Aoli. I believe a tablespoon of Aoli gives you around 100 calories. You can put it on a burger or even steak I imagine. May go great with deli meats as well like sliced turkey or ham. If any of you have figured out Keto bread or anything like that, aoli could be your condiment for that. Almonds with aoli possibly?"

keto,Keto Question - Trouble hitting calories,"So I’m about a month into Keto and been learning a lot as I go. I’m 5’11 and down to 258 pounds (started at 270 pounds). The macros I have been aiming for is &lt; 25g net carbs, 164g fat, 131g protein and about 1800 calories (that’s about a 20% deficit for me I believe). 

I’m normally under 20g of carbs, and normally under on fats (trying to come up short of fats so my body burns the stored fat) and I’ve been hitting my protein lately, occasionally I have come up a bit short on it. 

My issue is that when I get where my fats and proteins should be for the day I’m often only at ~1200-1300 calories. My thought is that I need to work in some more lean meat each day to get more protein calories while keeping fat lower to utilize my stores. Is this the correct path even though I’m not normally feeling hungry after I have my fairly food?  Im currently fasting throughout the day and using a 4-6 hour window for my eating usually split between two meals during that window. I’ve been a lot less hungry since keto so the intermittent fasting feels pretty natural."
keto,Coconut Butter Question!,I accidentally tried to make Coconut Butter with *sweetened* shredded coconut instead of *unsweetened*. It is not turning into a smooth butter.

It sounded like hell in there. It was loud popping and sizzling and I... I panicked and pulled it out after a minute. The edges were this delicious crunchy thing, and the middle was mush... So I tried again, longer this time, and I endured the unholy hell that resonated from the microwave for 80 seconds.

keto,What am I doing wrong? Please help.,"Hello everyone,

I am a 22 year old male and have been overweight for most of my life. I am currently 6’4” ~240 pounds. I have gone on diets before and have lost significant amounts of weight by just doing a calorie deficit and using food scales to track all of my calories, so I am not really new at trying diets (unfortunately my troubles are keeping the weight off).

I recently started keto around a month ago and have been following everything to a tee. I track all of my food (weighing everything by the gram) and eat 10-20 carbs a day. I have my calorie limit set at 1900-2000. I also do intermittent fasting and will do 16 hour fasts normally while sometimes Mixing in 20 hour fasts into the week. I drink a ton of water and also add some salt to my food to get my electrolytes in.

I am not very active and sit at a desk for my job for around 8-10 hours a day.

With all of this, the scale is not budging. I have not lost a single pound this month of doing keto. What am I doing wrong? I was thinking maybe it’s the diet carbonated drinks I have been having? They have aspartame and sucralose in them, but I am still in ketosis.

Please give me some advice. I don’t know what else to do. Starting to think keto doesn’t work for me as in the past normal diets with just calorie deficits I have seen much more weight loss.

TLDR: Doing keto and IF for a month, eating at a strict calorie deficit, not seeing any weight loss."

keto,Minimum calories in any particular day on keto,"So I am 195 now, and started keto at 220, and have also bee kicking up the workouts. I am looking to lose weight reasonably fast, but not like a crash diet. However, despite regular workouts, I find that some days I am just not hungry all day maybe once a week. Most days I have between 1400-2000 calories on keto (a big win over fighting to keep it under 2200), but yesterday I just wasn't hungry to an even greater degree. I had one tablespoon of butter in my coffee and 3 brazil nuts. Is this expected? I wasn't really hungry at all. Today my appetite is back to normal, though more on the 1400 side of things."

keto,This has changed and probably saved my life,"Suffered from bulimia for about two years and in recovery, the binging stayed, but the purging didn’t so I gained about 50 pounds in a year, coupled with a lot of family turmoil, I just wasn’t in a good place. As a body conscious person, I was constantly depressed over my weight gain. I’m 5’11 and at my biggest I was 230 pounds and couldn’t even stand to look in the mirror anymore. I had heard people talk about keto and how much weight they had lost on it, but subconsciously after hearing things from other people about it being unhealthy, I convinced myself it wasn’t for me. About a month ago I was fed up with my weight and decided to give it a try after trying everything from calorie counting to, unfortunately, just starving myself. As someone who is a huge meat eater, salads everyday just wasn’t going to work. Since I’ve started, I have never seen results like this. I’m already down 15 pounds and it’s only been a month. My goal is about 180 and I’m already only 35 pounds away. I just wanted to tell anybody that’s on the fence that this “diet” actually works and is sustainable. I don’t feel like I’m depriving myself of my favorite foods and I don’t even feel the urge to binge when I do eat. This has truly saved my life."

keto,Keto Cheddar Bay Biscuits!,"Howdy!

I made biscuits from scratch for the first time ever! I used Wholesome Yum's recipe (see link). As is, this recipe turned out pretty good. The texture is not quite Red Lobster but the taste is spot on.

If I can make it without burning the house down, anyone can!

keto,Mahler's Bread - something is wrong with the label.,"Hi all, I'm back doing keto after a few months' lapse while working from home, lockdown etc. One item I've always liked is Mahler's bread because when getting ready for work, it's just easy to have a piece of fiber-y, very filling toast and start my day.

If you look at the nutrition label of the bread, it says there are 80 calories in a slice, and those calories come from 2 g fat (2g x 9cal/g = 18 calories); 10 g protein (10g x 4 cal/g= 40 calories); 6 g carb (6g x 4 cal/g =24 calories.

18 + 40 + 24 = 82 calories -- which is close enough, due to all the rounding of everything to full grams. I mention this because it sounds like the breakdown of the macros matches the calories etc. No glaring errors there.

The nutrition label also says 5 of those 6 g are fiber. 6 g carb - 5 g fiber = 1 g net carb. And indeed this does seem like a very fibrous bread. It's dense and chewy and I feel like I've eaten something with high fiber after eating it.

Everything leads me to think this is 1 g net fiber per piece. Yet Mahler's advertising says it's 5 g net carbs. Almost like they did the subtraction in reverse. I wrote to the company and didn't get a reply.

Usually if I'm interested in how legit a low-carb product is, I look for posts where people with diabetes kindly share their blood sugars before or after eating the product. The only one I was able to find here said that their blood sugar went from 105 to 108 an hour after eating two slices of the bread. So that sounds good too.

Does anyone else have experience with the Mahler bread that they want to share? Or has anyone gotten clear information about why the company says 5 g net carbs and not 1 g net carbs to match the nutrition label? If I'm going to eat something, I want to count it accurately. It's very odd. Thanks."
keto,Keto &amp; potatoes (hash browns),"Yo, I’m just shy of 2 weeks in and down from 94-86kgs and been going super hard. (Calories at c1,300/day)

keto,Issues with Lily’s dark chocolate?,I bought a Lily’s dark chocolate baking bar I thought I would give it a try. 2 carbs for 1 piece but the pieces are pretty big and I only eat half a day. Has anyone had blood sugar issues with this or is it ok in moderation?
keto,Advice Needed,"Hi All, 

At the start of UK lockdown, I decided I wanted to lose some weight, so started Keto and strict calorie counting, helping me to steadily go from from 160 to 135 lbs. Whilst I managed to control my nutrition very well, I really struggled with exercise (running) despite adding electrolytes I had terrible cramps in my arms when running anything over 5km. 

 I got seconded abroad in Aug, living in hotels, struggling to measure and eat healthy and essentially adding 25 lbs back to my weight. Ironically though, I struggle far less with exercising.

Having returned home recently, I am keen to get back on the Keto-train and lose a little, but obviously very hesitant as I don't want to lose my ability to go for longer runs. Any advice from the more experienced KETO-ers, or is it a simple matter of ""more electrolytes"" and ""more calories"" on exercise days. (Currently appx 1600cal/day)

keto,90-Day Keto/IF Check-In: 30 Pounds Gone!,"Making this post since it's officially the 90-day mark. I started keto/IF on 07/26/20 at 198 pounds and this morning weighed in at 168 (41F, 5'4"")! I cracked 170 last week; have not weighed in the 160s since sometime in 2015.

Consistency has been key so far. I recalculate my macros every ten pounds mainly so I am aware of my calorie allowance but I do not use a tracking app nor do I weigh my food. I never eat outside of my 18:6 window; I just eat lunch and dinner. No snacks or desserts or sugar substitutes. I will probably have to get strict in terms of tracking as I lose more weight but I will worry about that when I get there!

I saw another post on here from someone wanting to start on keto but concerned about budget. I can say I have not used MCT oil, bulletproof coffee, fat bombs, keto ice cream, or any other pre-made product or supplement that supposedly enhances this way of eating. Meat (mostly beef or chicken), lower-carb vegetables and berries, eggs, cheese, black coffee, sparkling water, and plain water keep keto simple and effective for me.

No exercise yet aside from walking a couple of times a week, but I plan to incorporate more consistent physical activity soon.

keto,Is this possible??,"So I’ve been toying with the idea of starting keto/IF, but with the current food situation I have, I don’t even know if it’s possible. Can keto be done with access to only a refrigerator and microwave? Currently I am unable, for reasons I do not wish to go into, to cook food outside of microwave use. And yes, this includes other countertop methods are out of the question as well. I have no idea when this situation will change, but I am so tired of fast food, canned food, and frozen dinners.

However MCT oil retails for about 20€ here. I know that for some that might not be a lot but the minimum wage here is very low and 20€ is what I make in a whole day of work.

I'm theorizing that my thighs have slimmed and that means less space down there, but I have to find a solution because I spend two to seven hours a week roller skating, and sweating, and I refuse to change my hobby.

I'm a woman, but guys, feel free to give suggestions if you've had the same experience or if you're trying to find a solution."

So lately Ive been just eating whatever I want aside from carbs and sweets. I try to calculate the macros in my head but I feel like I didnt have that consistensy I had before.

keto,Shirataki Noodles a godsend,Ever have that Ramen craving on Keto? Well go down to your local Japanese grocery and get a bag of Shirataki noodles. I use the Yam ones which have 0 net carbs (2 grams dietary fiber). They needed to be cooked in a special way but when done right they are delicious! Suggest you give it a try.
keto,Thoughts on nutramin vitamins,I am TERRIBLE at taking pills it doesn’t matter how old I get I just can’t get pills down unless I absolutely have to. So I was looking up some alternatives for keto pills and found Nutramin vitamins. They are gummies with no added sugar and only 1 carb per gummy so I was hoping someone on here knew what they are and hopefully I can get some opinions!
keto,Rock Bottom to Recovery,"Hello Lurkers!!!!!!!!!  Lots of you out there, reading success stories, looking for that spark.  Looking for that nudge that gets you rolling.  That gives you the courage to say, ""I eat keto"".  I don't really have any great advice and that frustrates me because I want you to get healthier.  To get happier.       
          
4 years ago today was a Sunday.  I had just turned 50 years old a few days before.  I was HUGE.  I was in Lubbock while my family was in Amarillo.  Only about 110 miles apart but I didn't drive up so we could have my birthday party because it was such a hassle.      
        
Anyway, that Sunday morning, I was laying in bed and I thought to myself, ""Do I want to get up and shower today?"".  You see, I was over 600 pounds and frankly, showering was a big big deal.  I had to lean up against the wall and rest my back a couple of times, the actual shower took forever because I had so much real estate to wash, and stepping in and out of the shower was gymnastic level difficult.  In short, I was a shitshow of fatness.   
        
Fortunately, I got up and showered.  I got dressed.  And that saved my life.  You see, I have no doubt that if I would not have gotten out of bed, I would have become one of those bed-ridden people you see on My 600 Pound Life.  I have no doubt that I would be dead today.         
         
Couldn't walk 54 steps.  Couldn't shower without having to rest for a minute.  Had to use a special thingy to put on socks.  Couldn't tie my shoes.  That's my rock bottom.  That's the day I felt more hopeless than ever before.  Scared.  I was trapped in fat.  
        
I started eating ""healthier"" by simply cutting down on calories.  Lost some weight and then a friend talked to me about Atkins.  Zero carbs for two weeks.  Right before I started doing that, I ordered a scale from Amazon.  It was a 700 pound capacity scale.  I was afraid that when I weighed myself, it would read ""error"".  When I stepped on it, it was like 595 pounds.  I was excited that I didn't max out a 700 pound scale.  That's my most embarrassing moment.      
    
All of the above is a rambling of bad shit because frankly, that was my life.  Just a rambling of bad shit.  But no matter what, that day that I almost didn't shower--that day was my lowest point.      
          
On November 14th, I started eating keto.  For some reason, I was good at keto.  I ""get"" this way of eating.  And I did pretty good.  Didn't cheat at Thanksgiving and realized that I might actually do pretty good.  In other words, I started to feel some hope.  Cheating at Christmas never crossed my mind because I had a big big big cheat planned for New Year's Day.      
             
In the USA, New Year's Day is full of football. This Texas Boy is a pretty big football fan and as such, had big plans to cheat because I DESERVED it.  I had lost 62 pounds.  I called the pizza place, placed the order and then 2 minutes later, called them back and cancelled the order.  I didn't cheat!!!!!!!!!!    
                    
That is my best day.  My proudest day.  It was on that day that I said to myself, ""Brian, you are going to win!!!"".      
      
October 23rd, hopeless.      
January 1st, unstoppable.    
                     
Lurkers, I have gone a long way to say this to you:  Make today your last day of you looking for that spark.  Make today your last day of waiting for the nudge.  Make tomorrow the first day of your new life.  Make tomorrow the day you take your first steps away from hopelessness.  Make tomorrow the day you take your first steps towards being unstoppable.  Make Saturday, October 24th a day that you will never forget.       
     
In front of you is a future.  A future in which you feel exactly the same as you do today.  Or a future in which you feel hope.  A future in which you feel confident.  A future in which you feel unstoppable.      
    
Lurkers, welcome to r/keto.  Welcome to your new you."
keto,Feeling Incredibly Dizzy,"5'6M SW: 192 lbs CW: 162 lbs GW: 150 lbs

I have recently adopted keto to try and lose those last 15 pounds. I have bought a keto shake mix and have been drinking that with water. I am drinking about 1,100 calories of shake a day. I am eating absolutely no food. I am also taking an electrolyte supplement.

I feel so dizzy every day it's unbearable. I finally broke down today and ate a handful of popcorn and half an apple. What should I do to combat this?"
keto,Confused about protein/macro calculators,"G'day All,

I've been here quite a while but rarely post. Had great initial success with keto a few years ago but since then (usual story) I've been lazy and the weight has crept back. So I'm back in hardcore mode (restarted one week ago), tracking food and doing OMAD 5 days a week (suits my work life). I've re-read the FAQ's and guides to re-educate myself. Played around with the calculators and this is where I've gotten confused! 

&amp;#x200B;

Cronometer calculator (on rigorous setting) allows me about **68g** of protein per day, which I'm finding hard to stick to.

The calculator recommended by the FAQ allows me about **115g** of protein per day, which sounds much more reasonable! 

&amp;#x200B;

And yes, I've read in plenty of places not to be to concerned about going over on protein. But it's bugging me that there's that much difference in the calculators!

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts? Should I stick with 115 or try to do 68? Hit a middle ground maybe?

&amp;#x200B;

TIA for any light you can shed on this."
keto,MCT Oil Clarity?,If you take more than 1 tablespoon of MCT oil is your body using that BEFORE burning your fat stores for energy? I am on my 2nd time of keto (dirty) and I’m down 37 lbs with 37 more to go. I’ve kind of stalled out even though I’ve recently added exercise 4-5 days per week. I’ve also added MCT oil again. I do two tablespoons a day. Someone that does strict keto told me this yesterday about more than 1 tablespoon being counter productive. I’ve not read this anywhere in the two years that I’ve been doing this (off and on) and can’t substantiate it so far. Last time I did two tablespoons also and lost 63 lbs in 5 months.
keto,Woken up 1am with anxiety and tingling feet - also a lot of cramps,"23M, just woken up at 1am with anxiety, and a tingling / pricking sensation in my feet that sometimes reaches my thighs, and other random parts of my body. I have been taking \[3 nutri align electrolyte supplements per day\]([https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MtlqymxFL.\_AC\_SL1187\_.jpg](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MtlqymxFL._AC_SL1187_.jpg)), and drinking around 3 to 4.5 litres of water for the last week or so. Today I've eaten a serving of cauliflower cheese and chicken bake, 1 pound / half a kg of 12/88 ground beef, and 8 generic supermarket sausages, although I've had bulletproof coffee too. Been having table salt with them too.

I've also been having excessive muscle cramps during exercise and sometimes I get them when I wake up. If I point my toes in a certain way right now, I can induce a cramp right then and there. This has been an issue since I started, so for about 2 weeks. Information online says it might be too little, too many, or an imbalance of electrolytes, or too much or too little water. Really can't get a definitive answer.

If anyone has any solutions then that would be grand, and if you would know a safe way for me to pull the plug on keto entirely and do away with this tingling and cramps quickly so I can start over, that would be fantastic too."
keto,Constant diarrhea on keto,What should I do differently? I almost know diarrhea is from all the fat I’m eating.

keto,Some keto budget + no meats/satiety problem,"I was doing keto for a while, I moved and now I am on a somewhat tight budget now for the next few weeks or months to come.

What would be best in terms of feeling full or best budget? What foods do you guys go for fiber?

I'm looking for some things easy to prepare, crunchy, and keep me full. I had this crazy idea of doing something like olive oil, butter, broccoli, cheese and something else for protein, can't think of what. I am looking for suggestions. 

Everytime I eat meat like chicken thighs, my stomach goes to this weird place where I cannot seem to feel full or cause stomach problems. I haven't had bacon in a while, I think I might try that again.

Is getting your salts/electrolytes, and multivitamins important too?

keto,BANANA TEA," 

Banana tea or banana skin tea or boiling banana peels is highly recommended for people who suffer from [insomnia](https://mediscare.net/how-to-treat-pregnancy-insomnia/), [depression](https://mediscare.net/natural-supplements-for-depression/), pregnancy [depression](https://mediscare.net/natural-supplements-for-depression/), chronic anxiety, low immunity, impaired metabolism, high blood pressure, [osteoporosis](https://mediscare.net/how-can-you-prevent-osteoporosis-naturally/), digestive problems, obesity, inflammatory diseases, skin irritation, and for myopia. and for those who recover from a long illness, surgery, or a specific injury.

# Banana Skin Tea Lowers Blood Pressure

[Banana peel tea](https://mediscare.net/benefits-of-banana-peel-tea/) is probably well known because it contains potassium, which helps maintain a healthy heart and lowers blood pressure. potassium is considered a vasodilator, it not only regulates the fluid balance in the body but also reduces stress on the cardiovascular system by relieving tension in the arteries and blood vessels.

# Banana Peel Tea Regulates Sleep

The main benefit of [banana peel tea](https://mediscare.net/benefits-of-banana-peel-tea/) is to treat sleeping problems and [insomnia](https://mediscare.net/how-to-treat-pregnancy-insomnia/).

High levels of tryptophan (an amino acid that makes up most proteins), serotonin (a compound found in platelets and serum that constricts blood vessels), and dopamine (a compound found in the body as a neurotransmitter), found in banana tea have been linked to improving sleep levels and reducing the incidence of [insomnia](https://mediscare.net/how-to-treat-pregnancy-insomnia/).

And restful and uninterrupted sleep in general.

Lack of quality sleep may increase levels of beta-amyloid (an amino acid primarily involved in Alzheimer’s disease) in the brain, and increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (source: [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/)).

# Boiling Banana Peels Can Relieves Depression

The dopamine and serotonin in [banana peel tea](https://mediscare.net/benefits-of-banana-peel-tea/) also help regulate hormone levels and increase [mood](https://mediscare.net/natural-supplements-for-depression/) as they are good neurotransmitters. And if you regularly suffer from anxiety or [depression](https://mediscare.net/natural-supplements-for-depression/), adding banana tea to your diet may be exactly what you need to remedy it.

# Banana Peel Tea Can Improve Bone Density

There is a good variety of minerals in banana tea, including manganese and magnesium, both of which contribute to bone mineral density and may help to prevent [osteoporosis](https://mediscare.net/how-can-you-prevent-osteoporosis-naturally/) altogether with age.

# Banana Skin Tea Helps in The Digestive Process

Potassium and magnesium are known to improve smooth muscle function which is important in the digestive system. This helps stimulate the peristaltic movement (the gradual wave of contraction and relaxation) that regulates bowel movements, thus preventing constipation, bloating, and cramping while also improving nutrient absorption.

# Banana Peel Tea Boosts The Immune System

one of the [benefits of banana peel tea](https://mediscare.net/benefits-of-banana-peel-tea/) strengthens the immunity system. Vitamin C and vitamin A in the bananas peel, help boost the immune system. As each of these vitamins are antioxidants. Ascorbic acid (a vitamin especially found in citrus fruits and green vegetables) stimulates the production of white blood cells, and vitamin A is directly related to preventing oxidative stress (an imbalance between the production of free radicals and the body’s ability to counter or eliminate their harmful effects through Neutralizing antioxidants) in the retina and prevents macular degeneration (deterioration of the small central part of the retina known as the macular) and the development of cataracts.

# Banana Peel Tea For Weight Loss

You can use banana tea for weight loss because it contains vitamin A, B vitamins, potassium, lutein (a deep yellow pigment found in the leaves of plants and in egg yolks) and other antioxidants. Many of these nutrients contribute to a strong metabolic activity, as well as feelings of fullness and satiety.

In other words, it is possible to increase negative fat burning through the major function of metabolism, and eliminate the desire to snack between meals or overeating. These surrounding effects combined with all that nutrient can aid in weight loss efforts.

[Banana peel tea](https://mediscare.net/benefits-of-banana-peel-tea/) provides many benefits for weight loss, and we can consider consuming the peel itself more effective than the banana tea itself. Since the peel is rich in both soluble and insoluble fibers, most of the benefits of the peel cannot be transferred to tea when steeping a banana.

These two types of fiber are known to slow digestion, suppress the appetite, and boost metabolism so you’ll feel satisfied, thanks to the tryptophan, dopamine, and serotonin present in bananas."
keto,A Minute In Silence,"I got hungry and realized I was out of quick keto foods... I tried a salad but it didn't do the trick... 

So I ordered a breadless burger and a diet coke. Litte did I know the fries would be automatically included. I smelled them and realized how much I miss them, that earthy smell of potatoes mixed with oil and salt... I have social phobia, haven't been able to leave home for over a week now (which I wouldn't have done anyway other than to shop for groceries). I don't have a partner or roommates and I'm terrified of my neighbours. I hate food waste, but I also hate how I've been using my body as food waste saving addiction machine. I ate about 20 of those little suckers, a little less than a metric cup... My net carbs today must have therein reached somewhere around 40-50g today. I'm hoping with my weight of approx. 258lb at 5'7 height it won't throw me out of ketosis. 

I came here to grieve those fries with y'all. Throughout my war-torn life I have come to grieve like an emotional athlete. I just wanted to have one of those first-world moments. Today I wanted to be that girl I would normally envy. I'm actually going into debt to afford this diet because the only thing I hadn't tried yet was to literally put my money where my mouth is. Mental illness makes you go into debt because you can't keep your life together. You lose your jobs because you are not healthy enough to keep them. My decision to start this keto thing was my way of attempting to rig the vicious cycle in its own ways. I know it's a long shot but the losses will be nothing I haven't already been through time and time again. I literally have nothing to lose. 

Yeah, so thanks for listening. I'mma go back to numbing my pain with Star Trek Discovery. I guess the short-haired, female black protagonist tickles my change-the-system bone :)"

keto,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4520304/,"Study talks about negative effects from eating fat. Please help me understand. 

Our recent studies, using the conscious lymph fistula rat model, demonstrate that fat absorption activates the intestinal mucosal mast cells


This is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the lymphatic release of mast cell mediators including histamine, rat mucosal mast cell protease II (RMCPII), as well as the lipid mediator prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). Clinical studies suggest that increased consumption of animal fat may play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease."
keto,Me (33f) on Keto for 22 days now having Period Concerns- i am very worried and need some advice/support,"Hello! I live in a very conservative society where it's not so easy for me to just walk into a pharmacy and get a pregnancy test without it being super uncomfortable and getting an abortion is also something that would be a huge challenge and very expensive as well.

I returned to keto and have been on keto for 23 days now, and my period is usually due in these +/- 3 days but I usually get it two days earlier every month from the date of the previous month. Today is the 23rd and last month I got it on the 23rd so it's technically late as i probably should have gotten it on the 21st. I know that this is hardly late but I am still very worried and extremely stressed as my partner and I made a stupid mistake and had unprotected sex twice in the last month. I cannot think about anything else or focus on anything. It's all I think and read about. But I am hoping that keto can possibly something that's delaying my period. I am having constant discharge and a tummy ache and have been bloated for a few days, and I have no idea if this is pms or pregnancy symptoms. Last night after I ate dinner I also felt a bit of nausea. Today I drank a cup of cinnamon tea and a cup of parsley tea but it didn't do anything. I am dying to just get my period!! I've never wanted it so badly in my life. 

Can I hear your experiences? I am so worried. So stressed. :("
keto,Keto and my diabetes,"I have always eat to much food because i i didnt know that carbs all turn into weight gain. Very damaging advice from everyone. Ifound out about Keto. I personallythink i have been diabetic from about 3rd grade, but who knows. 18 yrs old i found i was diabetic. For around 10 years i tried to eat right but i was just so damn hungry and my averages where in the 10 range. Then i moved and got a new doctor and he started giving me fast acting insulin and bam average was good and has been sense! I wanted to kill my doctors! Why would doctors not start me on it for so long and on top of that tell me to eat all the wrong foods! But my problem with fast acting insulin is the low blood sugars and man oh man So i just started eating more because of hunger and slowly gaining weight. Even on diets.  

so before keto i was taking around 65 units of fast acting insulin and nowi just take 4 or so units to cover high sugars because im just taking it to cover the highs as a result of not enough to eat. In a couple months ive come from 257 to 228. Last 15 pounds have taken a while. Seems to stall then drop a couple pounds in 2 days and that is very regular. Why idk. I eat a shake for BF then ham cheese then dinner rest of the ham large salad and alvocado and that is all i have been eating for over a month. Progress is slow but im getting there. If im not doing myself out by eatting the same please let me know.

Thanks Rich"

I'm also a binge eater I have been since I was 13 basically use food as a coping mechanism when I'm emotional and stressed or bored which I tend to be a lot of the time.

keto,PSL Starbucks Wannabe aka Copycat Sauce Recipe (Labor Intensive for the Fall Lovers),"It's that time of the year again.

Where Starbucks is making their PSL lattes filled with sugary, festive, and that hint of fall flavor in a cup.

I have seen so many great recipes, but I really want something that tastes as close to the original despite being on keto.

After googling a couple times I have found recipes of  copycat recipes of Starbucks for people who are not on keto and decided to change some things up so that it is! 

First you got to make keto condensed milk this is for ***1/2 cup*** of it!

**Keto Condensed Milk**

Ingredients:

5 fl oz of heavy cream

1/4 cup of swerve or 2 tbsp of your sweetener (I used lanko monkfruit from Costco)

1 tbsp of butter

Directions: 

1) Put all ingredients in a saucepan and bring it to a boil on medium heat. Make sure to be whisking it so that it is all combined while its heating.

2) Once it has reached a boil. Bring the heat to  simmer and leave it to simmer for about 10-15 minutes keep it eye on it!

3) Turn off the heat once you see it slightly thicken and let it cool it will look more like condensed milk once its cool.

&amp;#x200B;

**Keto Pumpkin Spice Sauce**

Ingredients:

1/4 cup of water

1/4 cup of your choice of sweetener I used lanko monkfruit from costco

3.5- 4 ounces of that keto condensed milk you just made!

2 tbsp + 2 tsp  (**aka half of 1/3 cup**) of Pumpkin Puree ( I ended up adding up to 1/3 of cup due to the canned pumpkin I bought)

1/4 tsp of pumpkin spice (I ended up sprinkling in more after tasting it)

pinch of salt

&amp;#x200B;

Directions:

1) Boil the water and sugar into a saucepan (until the sugar is completely dissolved)

2)  Now bring the heat low and the rest of the ingredients 

3) Stir over low heat for like a minute or until all the other ingredients are well mixed in

4) Turn off the heat. Let the mixture cool or you can use it to make your latte

5)  After the sauce is completely cooled. Store in a jar in the refrigerator.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now to make that damn latte. I like mine iced.

I have a Nespresso machine with Starbucks Nespresso espresso roast capsules that I bought on Amazon.

1) Pull 2 shots of espresso

2) While those are being made get a cup and pour about 1oz of that hardworking sauce you made. Mix the espresso shots with the sauce.

3) Pour about 2oz of heavy cream into that and mix it well since it's thicc

4) Add ice to the top

5) Sprinkle more pumpkin spice on top to make it IG worthy!

YOU DID IT! \*we are the champions song playing\*"
keto,Frustration,I started keto on 9/10 and have been consistent ever since down about 25 pounds! I went to a wedding and had an accidental cheat meal where I had wings that I didn’t know had sugar in it (last weekend) I’ve been back to under 20 grams of carbs a day. Besides that I feel frustrated because I have to get back into ketosis again and I’m allergic to milk and egg so I find myself eating mainly chicken breast lettuce and olive oil and being 500 calories below my macros. I just don’t know what to do anymore because I don’t think the keto I’m doing now is sustainable for very much longer!

keto,Why do we *need* to supplement electrolytes?,"Hey everyone,

I've been Keto for 3 years, I have no plans of quitting, but I am curious if this diet is 'natural', 'safe', 'okay', etc., why we need to so much electrolyte supplementation? Did hunter-gatherers, and other tribes and communities that practices keto and/or IF really supplement electrolytes? That seems doubtful. I know there was stronger magnesium content in their food, but how were they ensuring they hit the same sodium levels we need?

I ask because I moved to Miami in August, and despite being keto for 3 years, I still need 2-300% RDV of magnesium, and my salt intake is really aggressive. If I wasn't so used to living a keto life, I would find this behavior insane! (salt and magnesium water every hour, all day!)"
keto,"Ouch! Keto is working, but not fast enough to keep the “advice” at bay","Mixed feelings this week. I’m down 25 lbs, officially, (massive fluctuations during the beginning of my cycle so always have to wait until that passes) and I’ve had comments from friends this week both about how dangerous and unhealthy keto is (🤦 I’ve normalized my cycles and my insulin resistance is gone) and also, from another person, “do I want to join her on a 6 week weight loss journey? Because I thought of you when I heard this podcast.” She weighs about 115 soaking wet I’m guessing. I know both parties were well intentioned, but man is it defeating to be so overweight that nobody notices 25 pounds gone. The keto criticism comes from a nutritionist who specializes in eating disorder recovery so I know it is 110% well intentioned and genuine, but I just cannot eat a “typical” balanced diet and feel good. 

It’s lonely to be here sometimes."

. Heres my main question, does your body really go into a sort of starvation mode where it slows your metabolism to cope with the small amount of calories coming in.

. Does keto have an at  affect this at all. 

I'm not doing this long term , this is just sort of an experiment so I didn't ask if this safe because I'm not going to continue it if it affects me negatively at all."
keto,A foray into zero carb.,"For mostly the sake of efficiency with time, I went on a 2 day camping trip, bringing no food except a 19 oz summer sausage. I was not sure it would last me, as my usual method was to bring a meat to cook over campfire, and some sort of canned vegie ""for the fiber"". One plus of the summer sausage is it needs no refrigeration until opened. Although occasionally I can find mini summer sausages of about 6 oz, and they would be ideal, I opted to bring a small cooler with the more easily found 19 oz version.

I was pleased to find that I never felt hungry the entire trip. I would have an approximately 5 oz portion for breakfast, not carry any on the trail and after 6-7 hours would have another portion even though not hungry with the assumption I needed nutrients after all the hiking and climbing. 

Next time I will wait until I actually feel hungry before eating, and I will keep my eye out for the mini summer sausages. Camping is so much easier without dragging along cooking gear too."
keto,How do I know I'm doing this right,"Hi, I just started keto about 3 days ago. I've been getting a little bit of anxiety about wether I'm doing this right or not. Im reading articles and googling if everything I eat is keto, but it's just not feeling right. I've been eating mostly beef, cheese, eggs, bacon, and adding a little bit of leafy green to almost all the meals I make at home. I also got some pork rinds and jerky to snack on.

I think my anxiety is coming from not really believing yet that eating nothing but these kinds of fatty foods will make me somehow LOSE weight. It also sounds easy to be knocked out of ketosis, (which I have no idea if I've achieved getting into yet) so I'm nervous of things like ""does this have too MUCH protein?"" ""Am I not getting ENOUGH fat?"" It's only been a few days so I know time will tell, I just don't want to make things worse for me if I'm somehow messing something up. I know it's kind of the beauty of this diet, that you can eat these hearty meals on it, but IS burger meat and cheese really going to cut it for me?

Sorry if this isn't put together that great, I'm just at work kind of stressing just a little bit about if I'm really doing it right and I wanted to put this out there to just have some discussion with others so maybe felt the same way or have some answers. Thank you!"
keto,My experience with keto and its effect on my anxiety,"So first a little background. For about 10 years now, I've been suffering from anxiety and hypochondria. For all that time, pretty much any kind of pain or other kind of symptom etc I've had I have immediately assumed to be some kind of terminal disease or condition. It's been debilitating and has greatly depreciated my quality of life. It sucks and I could never reason myself out of it. Neither could the doctors - they'd usually spot I was a hypochondriac, and then try and convince me that I'll be fine, but I never really, truly believed them in the back of my mind, even if they managed to make me feel better for a short while.

Fast forward to me starting keto a couple of months back. Somewhere along the line I began feeling... Normal. Like I had a control over my emotions towards the signals sent by my body. I began feeling stable in the kind of way I'd believed to be impossible - I would still take things seriously when it felt logical to do so, but I wouldn't think about whatever pain or sensation I was feeling constantly, 24/7. It's like I gained inner perspective, but I know I've always had it, but now it's what wins out instead of fear.

1,5 weeks ago I took a cheating break of 5 days to just be able to enjoy the carbohydrate-riddled things my girlfriend enjoys. I also stopped taking my supplements for the duration of that period. It was all fine, but for a couple of days after that period something happened: my anxiety and hypochondria came back, strong as ever. Suddenly I was sure again that I had cancer, or that the pain in my leg must be a bloot clot and I was going to die to it in my sleep.

After resuming my keto lifestyle, over the last 4 days or so, the anxiety settled back down. Over the last 2 days I've become sure that there must be a correlation. Taking D or other vitamins could have an effect too, mind you, so I'm not 100% sure this is a keto benefit - but I feel like changes in one's vitamin intake wouldn't actually cause major changes in a matter of days like this. Also we're talking time period of 10 years, you bet I tried taking all kinds of supplements during that time. One possibility could also be that I have a condition such as insulin resistance without knowing about it as that has an effect on the brain, and keto is working to fix it as my weight goes down (not sure if that condition can specifically induce anxiety and hypochondria, though).

One thing's for sure though - if it's keto that's doing this, I can never go back to eating a ""normal"" diet again. I just value this change too damn much and living in terror is no way to live.

TLDR; I have reason to believe keto is directly affecting my anxiety in a very positive way and allowing me to enjoy life better than I have been able to for the past 10 years."
keto,What should I watch out for if running a 5-7K in the morning doing keto and intermittent fasting during the day?," 

I run at 7:00 AM, spending 400 to 600 calories, then around 8:00 AM I have my bulletproof coffee.

I have a keto meal (proteins, fats, fiber) at around 11:00 AM and 15:30 PM, then after my gym workout around 18:00 PM, I have a normal meal with proteins, carbohydrates, fiber, and fat, and then again around 9:00 PM. I don't eat from 9:00 PM until 11:00 AM the next day, so 14 hours of fasting and keto effect until the meal after the gym workout, at least I think it should be, no?

Started last week, I feel very good throughout the day, better than before when I ate carbs with every meal.

Is this a good strategy? What should I be careful about counting on that I spend around 800 calories a day working out?

I'm afraid of going full on keto, but am I wrong?"
keto,"sprinkling small amounts of salt into water instead of ""making ketoade"", problem or no?","I've seen so many different recipes for ketoade, most being huge jugs, half gallon, gallon, etc. I'm not carrying that around at work, I have a 30oz hydroflask that I use and I'm sticking to that.

Today is my first day adding anything to my water (I've started to track my food intake and noticed I'm not getting even close to enough since I'm trying to cut down on calories). What I did was take a salad dressing container, put 6g of Lite Salt and 6g of Himalayan pink salt in it. (I prefer using a scale instead of measuring spoons, this is a little over 1 1/4 teaspoons if you convert it.)

I got to work, sprinkled a little in my coffee, and the rest is for my waters. I may sprinkle a little onto my lunch here and there just to see how it tastes. My plan is to just sprinkle a bit in every time I fill my hydroflask, mixed with a True Lemon/Lime/Orange flavoring packet. It's not overpowering... I can barely taste it with the True packet... The only difference to how most people do it is I'm not putting a whole teaspoon or two in a drink at a time. I may be getting an 1/8 or a 1/4 tsp, but I refill my hydroflask about 4-5 times throughout the day.

There's no need to put the full teaspoon at a time in the drink, right? As long as my container is empty at the end of the day, I'm still getting all the electrolytes in my system, just not as fast?"
keto,Keto or fat adaptation,"Is it keto that makes your brain sharper or just being fat adapted in itself? Feels like I’m not as clear headed as I once was, when being strict and keeping carbs under 50 grams. I know I’m fat adapted, because I’m never hungry and never crave carbs. I just don’t have that mental clarity that I once did, and was wondering if it’s because I bumped my carbs up to the  50-100gram range. Thanks in advance"
keto,MCT oils while not on keto?,"I have done keto in the past and I’d say currently I’m only keeping a loose watch on my carb intake (trying to keep it around/below 90g). 

Recently I am undereating/ losing too much weight since I lost my interest in food after jaw surgery. so I started to eat whatever I want whenever I crave it, sugary smoothies, cake, noodles etc. but I am still losing weight since my stomach shrunk and it’s so hard to eat enough. 

I am trying to maintain my weight in a healthy way (without too much sugar &amp; inflammation) so I decided to up my carb and fat intake for more calories. 

And that’s why I ask is MCT oil a good idea not on keto?? I want more caloric dense goodies &amp; also want that big brain. 


* I am also on intermittent fasting (nothing strict it’s just my habit of not getting hungry till 11 am/noon) I guess I want to ask if i add it to my morning coffee (and/ or night time keto cocoa) will it mess up my energy level since my body might be switching energy sources too much???"
keto,Do you guys believe in calories in calories out?,"If you want to lose weight just eat less move more. If you're burning more calories than you're eating, you LOSE weight. What's the point in having a diet that is not sustainable? As soon as you go back to a normal diet, you will not know what the carb cravings will do to your body.

You guys know if you eat 1200 calories on keto you lose just as much weight as if you are 1200 calories on ANY diet."
keto,First-time poster. Third day on Keto and down by 2.65lbs.,"Please excuse me if I don't add the relevant tags and all, I am really new to Reddit and not entirely familiar with it, besides for lurking on this subreddit these last few days.

So today is my third day on Keto. I bought a scale yesterday to start tracking my process. It's 1pm here now, and since my first weigh-in yesterday I have lost exactly 2.65lbs. I'm not sure if I actually lost any the day before, but I doubt it as I literally just started with it.

(Below, I am just explaining exactly why I started Keto, and why it forms a part of my new journey.)

I started Keto because I recently got out of a relationship. The day before the breakup my partner pointed out to me that I have a bunch of new stretch marks. The next day, after 8 months of dating (which by the way was my first real LTR), he broke up with me via text, saying that he thinks we were becoming too serious. It might be all in my head, but I highly suspect it is because of the weight issue. Regardless, the breakup opened my eyes and made me realise my life was heading down the wrong path. My mental health, social life, self-esteem and general health were in tethers, and I knew I had to do something. Keto is the part where I am focusing on building a healthy lifestyle and healthy eating habits.  I am now seeing a psychologist as well to help me work through past traumas and to guide me on the right path to mental wellbeing. I've joined a support group which I see every second week, though our age groups vary quite a bit, it is nice to be able to talk openly about things I struggle with. I also started working on building a friendship circle again, and I'll be meeting a new friend for coffee tomorrow, which will kind of be my humble return to a once-thriving social life. These have all been tiny little steps I've been taking in the last two weeks because it's time to live life for me, and finally (even if it takes time) become the person I know I can, and want, to be.

I guess I am posting here not only to share my progress, but I think having strangers on the internet keeping me accountable could be a good thing. Yes, I do plan on even posting my failures, because it is bound to be a bumpy ride.

I'll post here once a week with my updates (only on Keto from now on, I promise lol), so if you see me slacking, please don't hesitate to use a few harsh truths if I sway off course! I'm also looking forward to following other's journey's on here as we walk the road to a healthy lifestyle together!"
keto,Need breakfast suggestions,"Hello, I am looking to start a keto diet and have my lunch and dinner meals sorted, I just need a good breakfast recommendation. I was looking for some sort of basic cereal to eat but I don't know which ones are keto friendly. (Also am I allowed to have milk?)

keto,10lb down in 4 days... is this too quick?,"Firstly I am so impressed with the results of the Keto diet, I am following it to the letter, and after 4 short days I decided to weigh myself to see if anything had changed and I have lost 10lbs.

keto,Frustrated,"Hi, I’m back on the keto/IF wagon again after regaining 80 pounds I lost on keto. The first month I lost 20lbs now 2 wks in the 2nd month I feel like I’ve been losing and gaining the same 2 pounds. I am currently 263 and I know I eat on the low end but it’s hard for me to get in my calories because I’m full off the meals I make.  I make sure I eat 1300 cal a day yes I know it’s low under 20 g of carbs and I make sure to have 100 g of protein And stay around 100 g of fat as this is a limit not a goal. I’ve incorporated walking I just don’t know why this time around it’s taking so long before it just fell off me no problem!  I get frustrated and then I start analyzing everything I’m eating and start thinking no I can’t have redmeat or obsess over every little thing I’m doing.......any words of wisdom?"
keto,Weighing yourself,"Hey guys, I was just wondering how often do you guys weigh yourself on a scale when it comes to losing weight? Does it make more sense to weigh yourself on a weekly basis ? I feel like I'm becoming to obsessive weighing myself everyday"
keto,Merging two diets?,So I am in need of urgent weight loss and I have done keto before for 2 months and lost 25 pounds. I am currently 220 pounds and my goal weight is 160-170. Is it possible for me to go on ketosis and a caloric deficit at the same time
keto,Celebrating Milestones,"Okay here me out. When I was much younger and quitting smoking, I had a colleague who'd lived through their partner always ""quitting"" smoking. When I told her I was quitting, she told me, ""Don't tell me when you're quitting, tell me once you've quit"".

This was to remove the temptation to prematurely celebrate success. Instead of giving people the reward/congratulations at the start, do it once a milestone has been achieved.

I bring this up as I see more posts with a theme of, ""Just started Keto"". This community is very supportive and I think that's awesome ... but giving gold to someone who is literally on day 1 of keto may not help them long term. Instead of giving gold/congrats we would be doing the person a favour to have an ethos, ""offer congrats for milestones"".

There's a good write up of this here: [https://hbr.org/2011/06/how-to-become-a-great-finisher](https://hbr.org/2011/06/how-to-become-a-great-finisher)

So in conclusion, I think it is good be welcoming but as a community, to help people reach their goals we should be celebrating milestones. Just my thoughts, I could be wrong. KCKO."
keto,Favorite meal,"Hello, my name is psykhe and I am a Mac and cheese addict. Since being in full on keto for 2 weeks (lower carb for a year or so), I couldn’t have my love of Mac and cheese with hotdogs. But I found a new version of my love. Riced broccoli/cauliflower mix, any type of cheese with a splash of 1/2 &amp; 1/2 nuked in the microwave until creamy. Then I add my Kobe need hotdogs that I got for a steal (usually around $9 but was $4 because they weren’t going to supply the brand anymore). My most recent favorite cheese is smoked cheddar.

And the best part? I made gf Mac and cheese for my husband. I took a bite of it and it was nasty. And this is my favorite brand.

What’s your favorite?"
keto,Does Noom offer a Keto focused plan?,"I was thinking of joining Noom.  My question is, do they offer an option to incorporate a Keto lifestyle with their program?  I've been doing Keto for about a month and have lost 12 pounds!  I'm just wondering if I am living the Keto lifestyle in a healthy, goal oriented way?"
keto,21 days in,"and I haven’t fallen off the horse once. I’ve stayed under 25 carbs a day (I aim to stay under 20 and have gone to 25 maybe twice. Trial and error amirite?)
1200 calories a day
16/8 IF and two meals a day. 

Still learning to find the happy balance between not too much protein, not too much fat. It’s a work in progress. Some days are better than others. 

Cravings aren’t really that bad
No keto flu
Not “starving”
I see virtually no differences yet
I feel less depresso for sure and my want for an afternoon nap after work every day is a thing of the past. 

I miss baked goods more than anything else
and tonight my family ordered pizza (my favorite)
So I made a 3 egg omelette with ham, cheese and baby spinach instead. It was *chefs kiss*

keto,Carbs in broth?,"I am really enjoying broth lately. I am drinking it instead of having meals because weight loss is my primary goal of doing keto. I was looking around online and it seems like all broth has at least 1 gram of carbs per serving. If it doesn't mention added sugars, where are these carbs coming from? 

I suppose it doesn't matter since I doubt I will drink 20 cups of broth in a day. Although I am finishing my sixth cup now..."
keto,40lbs down so far in 2020...keto is the reason.,"53yo male here.  I've ALWAYS been a yoyo-er when it comes to weight loss.  I'd do well for a month or two but gain it all back a few months later.  Every January for the last 20 years I've started the year fat and unhappy, trying every diet in the book. But inevitably, by autumn I'm packing on the lbs again and the cycle repeats.  Not this year.  With just over two months to go I'm still losing, down 41 pounds and counting.  I spent the first six months just focusing on diet but mid-summer I added a four-day-a-week PHUL weightlifting program to add muscle and get lean.  I'm very happy with my results.  I'm looking forward to waking up on 1/1/21 without the pall of having to drop a ton of weight.

Progress pic:  Not a great before pic but it's all I have.  Face gains are evident, though.

keto,Keto can be either the cheapest or most expensive diet on earth depending on how you do it.,"Keto is the cheapest diet on earth.  Chicken thighs are $0.88/lb right now.  I can buy 150 eggs for $20.  Ground beef in 5 pound chubs is $2.99 a pound.  $40 will get you every nutrient you need and 20,000 calories 1780 grams of protein.  This is about 1450 calories and 125 grams of protein every day for two weeks.  $20 a week.

Or it can be the most expensive diet in the world.  Grass fed steak, fancy pants cheeses, macadamia nuts, pili nuts, almond flour, expensive keto packaged food and bars, etc.  Easy to spend $1000/mo on food if you're getting ritzy.

Keto can work with all budgets, watch the sales and learn to cook!

keto,REQUEST: Best meals/snacks/so on?,"I'm tipping my toes into Keto again, since last time I only stuck with it for a week about 10 months ago. (Poor motivation and self control, but I've changed a lot of my life style since then and want to seriously try again) The biggest problem I had was finding things to cook/eat, and figured I may as well ask what everyone here has been having success with. 

I know I can search up some articles or youtube videos but it kind of reads copy-pasted. I'd much rather ask you guys since you're all active on the Diet and not just a ""I tried this for 20 days here's what happened"" crap.

Anyway, I love all kinds of meat, cheese, eggs, so forth. The only thing I'm not really into is Fish, with the exception of Tuna. Are there any good ""Keto Friendly"" tortillas? Any hidden snacks that I should know about that you wouldn't think had a Keto friendly option? Any and all help would be massively appreciated."

Anyways- since I can’t have bananas on keto, what are some good ways of getting potassium in my diet. I was in the supplement aisle at Walgreens and was overwhelmed by the options. If you keto-ers have any other supplement recs, please send them my way. 

I do have a scale at home that ways by the gram- it was originally purchase to measure coffee- but I’ve been using it lately to measure out portions. I cheated last night and had 7 grams of an apple after a run. Would it be dumb to weigh out a minute portion of banana every once in a while to gain some potassium?"

Keto has definitely brought on some mental fog, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. But overall, I have more energy, feel more confident, and am extremely proud of my commitment and the progress I’ve made. I haven’t weighed this little in over 3 years!!!

keto,Where are The Carbs in This Drink Mix?,"So I've been doing keto off and on for about 3 years now and I'm pretty confident in my knowledge about carbs, ketosis, CICO, etc.  I recently switched to flavored water drink mixes instead of soda due to acid reflux, and noticed even the sugar-free ones have carbs in them.  One of them even has 3g per packet!

https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Sugar-Free-Wild-Strawberry-Energy-Drink-Mix-1-1-oz-10-Count/11303905

Could anyone tell me where these carbs are coming from? 

Also, if anyone has a suggestion for a different kind of drink mix I could use that is lower/no carb that would also be appreciated!  I usually drink 4-5 30 oz bottles a day, and 2 carbs on average per bottle is half my daily carbs!

I'd prefer a drink mix but other suggestions are welcome too, just nothing that will trigger my acid reflux.

Thanks in advance!"

keto,Just really thankful- not even two months in...,"I feel like my mind has been blown since Week 1, when it felt like fat must be literally melting off my body for my weight to go down so quickly (I appreciate much was water weight). I started September  8, after some particularly embarrassing photos of me and my kid on a camping trip helped me see what I'd denied for a while. I weighed in at 245 pounds- class III obesity. I lost 22 pounds my first month, and I'm now down 30 pounds, and within spitting distance  (5 lbs) of ""normal, Class I obese."" 

And that's all great. I mean, I'm so thankful for it. But even more, I'm glad that I no longer crave sugar.  I was the woman who lived off dessert and diet sodas. Recently, I ""cheated"" with a bite of my son's apple (still within daily carbs), and it was shocking how sweet it was. If I have cravings for off plan foods, that's what it is, fruit, or maybe a potato. I honestly never think of cookies or candy. And it's so little a temptation that having it in the house doesn't bother me.  I've been successful on diets before, but it's never been so mentally easy. It's always been a lot of work. This isn't! And I realize it's all the fat. It really does satiate me, and make me feel less deprived. I

There's an outside chance I could start the new year as ""just overweight."" I appreciate that's unlikely, but I should at least be under 200 lbs, and I'll never be so happy to just miss a goal. The fact that such huge changes can take place in such short periods of time and so painlessly is something I'm beyond thankful for."
keto,Should I break the diet?,"First 6 days of keto were great, I was feeling light, energized and better than ever, but then it hit me, the keto flu. I read the sub and started drinking powerade zero, added more sodium to my diet (1 year ago I quit salt) also my water intake has been good, and I've been eating foods with more magnesium due to this being perhaps an electrolyte loss problem but nothing helps. I wake up and feel awful, no energy, fatigue, brain fog and some palpitations, this has been going on for about 3 days. I suffer from vestibular disorder also, perhaps I relapsed again and this diet is not for me? I feel kinda disappointed because I started losing weight, but I don't know if  I should break it to start feeling better again."
keto,How to take a break,"Hi everyone. I'm going on vacation this weekend and decided to take a break from keto for the 4 days I'll be gone. I know for a fact I'm going to be eating rice and pasta and bread and all that, so I'm looking for some advice.

Is it best to just stay on keto until I'm there and it happens? Should I start weening myself off of fat and increase carbs a bit over the next two days? 

Also, any advice on how to do this and be able to transition back efficiently next week would be appreciated."
keto,Pea or whey protein okay? and difference between South Beach and Keto,"In looking at meal options and protein choices, I like the idea of pea protein (i believe its an extract when its in things like the no cow protein bar) but is it keto or south beach friendly? What would be the difference between keto and south beach when it comes to protein in protein bars or shakes? Same go for whey protein?"
keto,Just ate more than 20g of carbs and am worried,"I had my usual 15-20g of carbs this morning. I went on two walks, probably an hour altogether. Regrettably, I ended up having 82g of carbs. What should I do to counteract this? I was thinking of fasting for a day or two, as I’ve got prior experience with fasting. I’ve been on the diet for about 4 days now, having been doing low-carb before, sticking to less than 60g a day."
keto,Macros- Calories- OMAD- Workout Suggestions,"Hi Everyone!

I am finally mentally ready to start Keto again (This time I'm not giving up) I started 9 days ago and have already lost 10 pounds which I know is mostly if not all water weight. 

26F/ SW:285 CW:275 lightly active

I'm looking for a little advice.. 

I have used the Keto calulator to calculate my macros and I feel like its asking me to eat to many calories/ more than I personally want to consume. I have experimented with OMAD and eat from 5:30-6:30pm window- I have never felt better- so clear and have a lot of energy during the day. I do drink one coffee in the morning and a lot of water to help me keep full during the rest of the day. I really like OMAD and would like to stick to it at least Monday-Friday. I have a one year old son at home and would like to eat smaller meals as a family on the weekend during his meal times. I can average about 1000 calories during this time and this makes me feel very full and satisfied. I am wondering what my Macros/ Calorie intake should be during this time?  or any advice/feedback? Please go easy on me as I am new to this. 

I am also looking for suggestions for what I should be doing as far as workouts! 

My reason for wanting to lose the weight is to be at a weight I'm comfortable with to start trying for baby number 2, to set a good example for my children, and to be more confident and happy with myself. 

Thank you so much!"
keto,Keto-friendly ways to thicken up recipes?,"I tend to improvise recipes when cooking pretty often. If something I'm making looks too thin, I usually add flour or cornstarch or another dried carb loaded product to thicken it up a bit. 

For example, I tried to make keto friendly chili last week and it ended up suuuper liquidy, so much so that I had to add noodles to soak up the extra liquid. Saved the dish, but alas it was no longer keto as planned. 

Any tips on the best keto-friendly ways to thicken up a too-thin recipe?"
keto,Help with protein!,"I don’t know whether putting my macro totals here will matter or not, but I’m new to keto for a week, and reading that too much protein can actually kick you out of ketosis. I’ve used multiple calculators, and the range is sometimes 20 grams difference. I know protein is one macro to make sure to get to every day, so I want to hit the right amount. I can provide my specifics if needed."
keto,Complete loss of appetite,"So I know it’s common for people to have a dramatic decrease in appetite on this diet, but I don’t want to eat anything unless I’m really hungry, and I’m not craving anything at all. I feel like before I started the diet over 2 months ago I relied too much on what I craved, mainly high carb foods, and now almost nothing seems appetizing. I’ve run into a problem where I’m not getting enough calories in per day and it’s slowing my weight loss. I’m 6’4”, 17-years-old, and I started at 269 pounds. The lowest I’ve gotten is 251 and right now I’m at 256. I’ve been fluctuating around 255 for a few weeks now and I’m wondering what to do about it."
keto,Keto and students,"Hello im a student im 171 cm and 82 kg i wanna lose weight so i thought about keto but i think as a student who lives solely on their on a student job salary its hard to find a keto program that is economically viable?

keto,Update: I don't know what the fuck to do. My life turned to shit in one day.,"I'm not sure why I'm posting here. Maybe just because I need to relate to someone else, maybe because I'm just looking for pity.

But yesterday I made a post, saying it was the shittiest day of my life. Lost my AirPods Pros, thought that was bad. Then my (ex) girlfriend went to her mother's house because she was pissed. Then I lost my dog due to fucking xylitol. 

Guess what? Life ain't done with me yet.

The urgent care vet? Wants $4620 dollars for the operation and ""care"" for my dog. I have no idea how I'm going to pay that. 

My girlfriend? Was upset over me being depressed because MY FUCKING DOG DIED. Broke up with her, on the spot. I don't know why the hell I was dating that sociopath.

Work? Last thing I want is to do right now is paperwork. But I'm so broke I can't even afford to take vacation days. And they won't give me a single day of paid leave. 

I've put Trevor (my dog), into my freezer. It felt SO WRONG. I can't even open it. I want to bury him in a coffin, but I can't afford one. I don't even have a backyard to bury him in. My parents advised me to just bury him in a park or cremate him... But he was one of my best friends, family even. I wouldn't bury my dad, or even a distant cousin in a cardboard box. Why would I do that to Trevor? But I don't know. I'm so confused right now.

I guess since this is r/keto, I'll say this. Yesterday night, I didn't technically cheat. I drank a lot of whiskey though. Today I haven't eaten anything. I just feel sick to the stomach. 

Life's fucked up. Diets probably not doing great. Don't know if I can even stay financially afloat. Not sure why I'm posting in r/keto , but I guess the only reason I can think of is because I feel like this is a community I'm a part of? And I need to share my problems with SOMEONE."
keto,Will Zyrtec break ketosis or autophagy?,"I get aldis brand Zyrtec, here are the listed inactive ingredients:

corn starch, FD&amp;C blue no. 1 aluminum lake, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, polydextrose, polyethylene glycol, povidone, titanium dioxide, triacetin

Corn starch sounds like it would break it, but it’s probably a really small amount? Should I weigh the pill to see if it’s less than a gram? Lol

Thanks in advance for any advice :)"
keto,Myfitnesspal Community anti-keto hate?,"I have given a look at the MFP community boards (ye, I know, sorry!). I have noticed that, whenever somebody posts something pro-keto, they get a barrage of abuse. 

Is it just my impression? I thought it was only vegan who hated keto, but it looks like it's the average-Joe-know-it-all that has to stick their nose in."
keto,Multi-colored carrots-lower carb count?,I recently bought a bag of the multicolored baby carrots from Trader Joe’s and I noticed that the purple/white carrots don’t taste as sweet as the orange ones. I tried looking up if they are lower carb but didn’t find much info. Does anyone know if they have a lower carb count vs traditional orange carrots?
keto,I'm going to Trader Joe's!,"Next week I'm going to be staying at an airbnb that's two blocks from a Trader Joe's, which I don't have where I live.  I'm excited about it, as if I'm going to Disneyland or something.  What are some must-have items that y'all love?  I'd like to get in and out of there quickly and purposefully if possible.  I already know I'll be stocking up on some of their seasoning blends, which I often order from Amazon.  The first evening in town at least we'll probably just want to pick up something for dinner from TJ's.  I'll have a kitchen.  Would love to hear what your faves are and would welcome your suggestions!"
keto,Advice on how to get unstuck please!?,"I’ve been on keto for 4 months now and 2 1/2 weeks. On the fourth month mark I reached 40 lbs loss. However I’ve stayed on that mark for 2 and a half weeks now.. I eat clean, I work outside 10 hours a day all I do is sweat, I workout at the gym and at home and yet the scale will not move! Any advice please? This is a real bummer for me I wanted to reach 50 lbs by 5 months but it’s not going to happen at this rate."
keto,Staying hydrated,"Hi!

I have always struggled with hydration...I am not a fan of plain water and often find myself at the end of the day without having anything to drink since the morning. 

Since I have been working from home I have found a strategy that works for me!

I have a glass in the washroom (medium sized...about 1.5 cups) and every time I ""go"" I wash my hands and then drink a glass of water before I leave the washroom. 

This has made a significant difference in my hydration by the end of the day and it feels like I am not actually drinking a lot of water.

And, it's kind of a self-fulfilling process...the more I drink, the more I visit the washroom, the more I drink...you get the idea!

I still drink my morning coffee, and herbal teas and bubbly water during the day too, but I feel so much better now that I am getting enough straight H2O!"
keto,(255lbs -&gt; 180lbs) Keto changed my life! My personal* experience.,"255lb me- Incredibly lethargic ALL THE TIME and sleep never helped, always back pain...always, low confidence and self esteem which lead to a lack of social life - Overall depressed. I wasn't able to find many photos of myself during this time, because of how uncomfortable I was on that side of the camera.

[255lb Before](https://imgur.com/JU3D5lg)

&amp;#x200B;

180lb me - Increase in discipline and confidence which helped with socializing, glorious sleep with back pain  practically non existent. Overall happy, and excited to obtain my future goals.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never been the one to share on the internet, and don't have any social media profiles, mainly due to confidence issues from not prioritizing health in my life, but today I'm finding an urge to share a little bit of what I learned from my journey for those out there that have been teetering on the idea of hopping on keto to help with their health/fitness goals, and to maybe help give some morale for those that are having a difficult time with the obstacles  many of us have faced and are facing!

&amp;#x200B;

A few personal points I've come to realize along my Keto journey;

1. **Keto is a tool. Carbs are not bad. Carbs can be used as a tool as well.**

\- At one point in all of this, I found myself demonizing carbs, this was not a good outlook. And incredibly misguiding.

2. **Uncomfortability is inevitable, but not impossible. You CAN do this!**

\-  ""Discipline is the invisible bridge between goals and accomplishments. Discipline is doing what you don't want to do in pursuit of what you want"" - Jim Rohn

3. **Research... Research... Research. There is so much misinformation out there, it is scary.**

\- Try and side with opinions that are followed by recent studies. Maybe dip into researching the basics into nutrition if you haven't already.

4. **It's COMPLETELY OK if you slip up. Don't beat yourself up after binging pizza and cookies... Sometimes... s\*\*\* happens.**

\-I've found myself beating myself up over the slightest slip ups and to be honest, it's not worth the mental real estate of feeling guilty. Be happy and be vigilant.

**5. Consider investing into some home gym equipment. Small or big. Anything that gets the blood flowing! I highly recommend a row machine.**

\- Exercise and Keto is an INCREDIBLE DUO to keep things summarized. Also there aren't many things out there in the world that can buy you time in your life. Commute / life expectancy.  


  


  
I hope this reaches to someone that may find this helpful in anyway, I've come to this subreddit many times to see the success stories and it's really helped me! So I'd like to say thank you to all of the people who share their journey!"
keto,Question about carbs and sugars,"So, if a label says ""35 grams of carbs per 100 grams, 5 of which are sugar"", does it mean that the 30 of these grams are fiber? Can I ignore these 30 grams and only count 5 towards my carb limit, or is it not how it works?

Sorry if that was already answered somewhere :)"
keto,Losing weight after keto?,"I'd like to preface this post by saying, I am in no way bashing keto. I feel keto is a great diet and has worked wonders for me. That being said, I usually cycle on and off keto depending on my fitness goals and whether the sports I am involved with are in season. I have just recently ended a keto cycle and began to eat (healthy) carbs. The servings of carbs per day is still somewhat small but obviously more than when i was on keto (1-8g on keto v.s. 18-38g off). I noticed within this last week of ending my keto cycle I have become much more lean, which usually does not occur when I come off the keto cycle. I wanted to know if anyone has any information about this or any experience."
keto,Overeating,"I quit smoking a month ago and I few great. I found it relatively easy to quit — I just made my peace with it and don’t think about it too much. So... for two weeks post quit, I allowed myself to eat anything I wanted. I went keto a week ago and have been so hungry ever since. I am keeping it keto... The problem is I keep overeating - calories wise, and a lot of cheese! I had 200g of day in one day! Obviously, I gained 2 lbs my first week of keto, lol! Ugh! Way too much fat and calories, I know. I am on my 5’3” as well. I need to be keto and low carb and I need to get a grip. Maybe celery! Fasting?? Any suggestions are welcome...!"
keto,Any frozen keto bowls I can buy at the grocery store?,"I want to join the keto movement, but cooking eggs and sausage and other meats everyday is not very convenient. I was wondering if there are any keto bowls you can buy in the frozen food aisle. I live in Texas, so HEB and Walmart are my only options. Thanks for any help!"
keto,Keto Avocado Coffee Milkshake," Keto Avocado Coffee Milkshake  Ingredients: 1/2 ripe avocado, peeled and pitted  150ml black coffee (hot or cold as you like)  50ml coconut milk  1 tbsp collagen powder 1 tbsp lakanto sweetener  1/4 tsp ginger powder  1/4 tsp cinnamon powder 1/2 tsp turmeric powder  1 tbsp coconut oil"
keto,Podcast or YouTube discussion about eating bread with olive oil and vinegar in the context of insulin sensitivity?,"I could have sworn I heard someone (possibly Peter Attia or Jason Fung?...) somewhere (posisibly a podcast or YouTube?...) discussing certain countries that are skinny despite eating a lot of bread because they serve it with olive oil and vinegar, which help to moderate the insulin response.

Did anyone else see or hear this?"
keto,Guess we are all different,"So i am starting my third week on keto and i have not lost a lot.... i am 5 feet 11 inches around 260 been training for 35y and i am 48.

My sport doctor highly recommended keto he went in a few seminars over the past few years, not only on weight loss, but also cancer, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure etc.

I dropped the carbs 3 weeks ago, i lost a bit of water, and i ate all my macros, but in 3 weeks i have not lost a lot of weight.

At my age i decided to move away from powerlifting, i did one year of stronglifts, but now my body is wrecked... i know lots of people live off squat and deadlift but at some point the body gotta give. I got some prolotherapy in the lower back, one of my knee was cracking silly and hurting and also my hips.... still getting treated for this.

I switch to the adonis index program, its more of a bodybuilding approach with moderate weights, then lifting super heavy 5 x 5.

I am staying on keto i am in ketosis and have not kicked out, but i need to re adjuste, i might be eating too much even if i stay within what the macro calculator gave me.  

My goal is to lose 50 pounds by next summer if i can a bit more. My workout yesterday was awful, energy was way off, and yes i do take my electrolytes.

I just order a pre workout supplement lets see how things go for the rest of the week. This time around i added fish, for the first time in my life a part tuna when i was younger i never ate any fish, now i try to eat salmon 2-3 times per week shrimps, sole etc. I also eat eggs chicken red meat hard cheese, bacon."
keto,I feel like I’m never full and I’m overwhelmed every time I have to eat,"Currently I’m more loosely following Keto while getting other stuff on track, like my general sleeping and exercise schedule. I’ve had depression for most of my life and struggle with that too. I’ve always had issues with executive dysfunction and forcing myself to eat, and my mental loophole was to have low-effort food on hand. 

None of which I can eat now. I’m finishing off a loaf of sprouted whole wheat bread (cuz I’m poor and I can’t waste food). Very slowly. I’ve totally cut out potatoes, pizza, still working on sweet stuff...

Anyways. I’m on glipizide at the moment and if I don’t eat regularly, and when I take it, I get so lightheaded I can’t function. But when you’re dealing with depression and no support network for a diet change, and now you can’t have any quick foods, and your old foot injury is acting up again...it all gets to be too much. 

I’m not sure what else I can do to try and motivate myself over my executive dysfunction/depression/body pains and cook. On top of exercising (which at the moment is an hour a day of walking my dog, I’ve got muscle loss on my left foot from a bad injury and subsequent orthopaedic surgery). My dog is pretty much the only thing keeping me going right now."
keto,"2 months, &lt;30g carbs per day, 1 lb lost, starving all day every day","Okay guys. What am I doing wrong?  I’m keeping my carbs as low as possible (only source is nuts, a few non-starchy veggies, and a little dark chocolate ~10g carbs). I’m eating more fat than I’ve ever used in my life (gawd, I’m cooking with freakin bacon grease and adding an insane amount of butter and heavy cream). But I can’t cut my total calories because I’m starving ALL. THE. TIME.  Yes, I drink water. Yes, I sleep - almost too much with the fatigue. I’ve tried upping salt and potassium. No, it’s not the keto flu because I’m at 8.5 weeks now."
keto,5 months 172 to 126 and still going,"A year ago I was at my biggest and I decided to make a change and some of my coworkers were skeptical if I would be able to lose the weight.

keto,Keto meal help?,"I'll lay it to you simple, im a damn boulder dude. I weigh like 220 lbs at 5'7 age 17, and do nothing but eat fast food and play video games. I just wanted to know if this meal i plan on eats for the next couple of weeks is keto friendly and will help me towards losing weight.
 
the meal is: a grilled chicken patty, two boiled eggs, half a fresh avocado and a bit of cheese to top it. Thats literally all i plan to eat since im a bit tight for cash, anyone have any thoughts on this and what i could do to improve it? Thanks in advance:)"
